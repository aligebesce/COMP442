"And er  Hannah's going  we started off the conversation where was the perviest you've ever had one  I mean, knowing that I didn't have one, ever had one before  and that was Mark , feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes"
I think !
And I was really upset about that as you can imagine!
But like erm  what was I saying?
Oh yeah  so I was going what's the perviest place?
"I was thinking, you know, Scotts bound to have some pervy ones off Mandy !"
"But like er, and he was going oh I've never had one except for like, this Franny  bloke!."
Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they?
Yeah.
I suppose so.
"It's all the fashion, innit?"
Yeah.
Rather be spivvy.
on the back of his  it's just so sad.
"cut as well, innit?"
I know.
"My brother, oh, it's sad."
"My brother's got this mate at school, called Victor."
"He's got a pair of shearing scissors and he's been doing like, this boy's African, so he's got, you know, Afro hair, which you can do curly-wurly signs on the back of him, it looks pretty neat."
"But Ryan decided that he'd have his head shaved at the back of his head, so he got this boy to write his name on."
"It shows you how thick this boy is, he wrote on his name, he spelt it  R I E N ."
Rien.
"and this is really sad, and he told me mum that he'd been to a hairdressers and done it."
"Oh, did he?"
Yeah.
How did you know it was his friend done it?
"Cos of Nat cos Natalie, she's a right little squealer, she is."
"I don't, Natalie's Samantha's sister."
"Erm, she, she at school with Ryan,"
I don't suppose the hairdresser
in the same year.
"Well, my brother had a smack, cos Natalie tells her what Ryan's been up cos she's a bit like that, erm, likes to sort of erm, squeal, you know."
"She said, have you seen Ryan's hair."
"I said, yeah, and she went ah, she went, Victor did that."
I went  what ?
"I went, is this this well hard bloke from Brixton, cos Ryan keeps going on about it, like we I said, is he do, I said, oh, we went to Oxford Street today, and he went, is that anywhere near Brixton?"
"I went  I don't think so, Ryan, and he went, ah, cos I wanna go up there, it's well hard up there."
"I thought, why he's saying that, and then I looked, and Victor comes through now, and he went, yeah, I wan he goes, I wanna go up London and get some clothes, get some really stylish stuff up London, I was like, yeah, Ryan."
"I said, you only get a bigger selection, that's about it."
"He said, no you don't."
"And Mark's there, I said he'll switch it off at night."
"Fine she said, as long as there's nothing left too near the fire."
"So I took the envelope off those tickets and I tore that up and wrote down and I stuck it in the  water heater that the sitting room fire may be on, please check."
I put another one then on the draining board.
"Cos if they're going to fix it round the sink, he doesn't know where they're gonna put it."
"You know, while I was there Darren came in."
And he said er have all the jobs been done yet?
And I said well no I said there's some water I said.
Mark's on holiday this week I said.
they've put him in another.
Oh that's right he said.
"I heard something about this he said, er  I was on holidays  all last week he said but erm  it's bloody lies cos I saw him last week."
And he said erm  yeah he said cos we've gotta pay this he said because it's all in the guarantee.
In the warranty.
And he came in and I said and the mirror on the dressing table isn't done.
You know and  that's gone and I said feel these beds I said.
They're soaking wet.
And he felt them and he said they are a bit he said.
"So I said well I  Danny rang this morning and he got permission to put the fire on  and put them, I'm going to move them all into the  front  and erm to air them up."
And I said there's no way anybody can sleep in there.
That's alright he said.
And he checked and then he went  So I took the bags off the pillows in case they were sweating in the bags and I put them out on the seats.
I put the quilts all out on the seats.
And .
"Because there's eight  there's er   seven, there's eight pillows then and"
He's done nothing.
Yeah.
He
Mm?
"The girl in the coun the girl behind the counter, the little tiny one."
Small and
She's still there?
"Snapped this one off  er you know in an ac he fell over or whatever, on his"
"Yeah, that's right."
said oh god  he didn't know whether to pull it out there and then
But it's  very hard
But  went to the dentist and he said leave it  pushed it right back and he said it will grow back.
Did it?
Oh yes.
Ah it must
Long as the roots are
"Oh well yes, oh well yeah, oh well now obviously"
So er
I mean my boy had a er a terrible accident ten years ago and smashed all his face  all his teeth were   when we first saw his face he'd got no teeth left  but it's  got them all back.
"And they're all back and  yeah even though they were all, they were all loose  I mean  still fresh you see the, the break."
"And it's, the life is in the, still in the tooth if you can find it, but of course sometimes they've gone haven't they?"
Too late for us
Put up with what we've got eh?
What?
Put up with what we've got.
Well as I say I look after mine but I've only got  the one missing.

"Oh yes that's stupid that, he he'll end up  if he doesn't go, with a mou a mouth of  sort of black"
"He, he'll have them all out."
Yes.
If he  we used to   the children
I think that's awful if young people
"even our grandchildren were, I mean er right from the beginning even if they only go and sit in the surgery  and just watch,ju you know just go and visit"
"Yeah that's, that's what they do now yeah."
"Get them trained, get them"
"Yes, yeah so they're not terrified."
"That's right, I mean  there's no pain"
Well I think that's awful  I do.
"Well yeah   well I suppose that's what she thinks, if she gonna go through the rest of her life with a bloke she hates."
"Well she might as well get rid of him now, I suppose  while she's young enough to find perhaps find"
Yeah.

"Well yeah, I would've thought so because le"
And hope .
"Well let's face it erm  he's got a, a half  a half a right to it."
I know yeah.
"He's worked hard, he's worked  he ain't he does work, when he works."
Does he though?
Well I dunno.
"I always see him riding about up the  Steven   there  he's always up there  I know when I used to work for  it was always Steve who used to be  riding to this farm, riding to that farm, checking on this, checking on that and taking the wages round that sort of thing."
And he does it now does he?

Well he's
"It is bloody huge, he's had the fireman round there!"
"I said to Geoff when you get your footings in they do you think to yourself, cor that ain't gonna be very big!"
You do yeah.
"But as soon as it builds up, you see how big it's gonna be  so I said well that's gonna be like erm Buckingham Palace I should think!"
But they haven't  a concrete slab!
Cos he said it's gonna be as big as the other house.
The old house.
And do you know he's getting all

"well he thinks he's gonna get his tiles for nothing isn't he, Geoff?"
"Yeah, he said I got a thousand pound  well I'll ring around, he said I got a thousand o off my, I saved a thousand pounds on my roof  he said  I thought bloody hell, how much  cost    costing him !"
"No, but he's, he went to the Ideal"

"They bought out, this company have bought out a new  tile  and he said they're looking for a sort of nice house to have as a sort of a show house and then  he thinks he'll get them for nothing."
Cor must be really !
"Mind you, I mean when we were choosing our bricks  he said ooh erm  he gave  number and that, I mean I know  he's not too bad is he when you want"
Oh .

"Four hundred or four hundred and  forty or something  erm  and on, I can't remember what he said he was getting them for I"
Two hundred and thirty?

Probably yes.
Yeah.
He told me that.
Two of them.
"If those men wasn't going there I would say right, put the gas fire on."
Put it on low and leave it the night and day cos it was left on for a week once wasn't it?
Mm.
"Oh god that was, that was  at er  the flat."
Left on for a fortnight.
Oh and it was a cold day.
But it was in  August or the end of September or someth er er the beginning of September  and it was a chilly day but it was still summer.
"It wasn't, you know, it wasn't terribly cold."
"But we went home and I remember going in the room, I opened the door and  oh it's lovely and warm in here!"
"So I stood by the door  I wait till dad come in cos he was the last out  and it was always my fault like, I would have left the fire on not him."
So I stood by the door and I never moved till he went in   oh he said  But with a caravan I don't know.
Mm they're not very powerful grates are they?
"Dunno   Oh nan he says, get Mark"
"Is, is yours a  heater?"
Mm?

Well you either put one bar on  or the lot is on  or it's very dim like this is low and you can't see it at all.
There's no heat from it.
You want something that gives heat
There is heat.
But you can't see it.
Oh.
"But you want to air them beds, you want to dry them beds."
I mean you've got to have heat there.
Well Danny says get Mark and bung them in the bloody car and bring it home.
the best thing  you want to stick it in the room and put a   heater .
Well we could put it in the spare bedroom.
Put it up against the radiator.
Mm.
"But if someone's going there next week, that's  two beds, three beds."
You could put them in the sitting room.
But Geoff  said there aren't any bricks that are that much money anyway!
So I don't know whether he's right or not.
no.
Cos we
But we
rang them up and he was  dearer than all the  blooming  builders merchants!
Yeah.
At least Kevin was saying.
Cos you see we was lucky how we got our bricks  didn't we?
Weren't
yeah.

I .
Well how did you get to know about them?
I sold him the car didn't I?
That was it.
Yeah Geoff sold him the car
sold him a couple of cars
and he said well he'd
Oh.
"got a load of brick, where did he have them"
"He had it , he got caught  by  he got er"
there's like a big pallet all surrounded and he got a big pond down the bottom  it's erm  near Grimston Common
Oh yeah.
"common  and he lived at Grimston and er  he got this plot  and er what was  right next door to it was a sort of real big old  li like a  French chateau  and he wanted a big ge red  brick Georgian house, a real big one, sort of sitting at the back of this plot  that the owner"
Oh yeah.
had put down the end.
"Anyway he got all his bricks and everything  and er  he got all his ideas what he wanted  and then they turned round and said no, we're not gonna let you build down there."
So we bought his bricks.
"So he's got all his bricks up  virtually I think he said, but I ain't worried about it cos I'll get rid of them somewhere  and I helped him out, I sold this car and, and told him what I was doing  and he come I've just the thing for you, just  cos  was having bricks like your dad's, the sand grain sort of brick, you know."
Oh yeah.
"Ooh he said I've got just the  for you, he said,he said  ."
"Well it says in the book, push them back with  a stick ."
With a what?
With a stick and a piece of
Yeah
"Well if it's frozen there's no way  so er I rang up Mobil you see in  and the fellow said oh if it's been on for s you know  few years he said, take your calliper off, put it in the vice and just lever it back  that's what we do"
Yeah.
"Goes to get the flexible hose off  that was ruddy frozen, you the, the union?"
"Yeah, yeah"
"Rang him up again he said oh aye well we usually change those he said, the weather gets on them."
Said they're not like the old ones that go like  as though they're welded
Yeah.
and you're turning the whole pipe.
"He said the only, the other thing you can do is  loosen it off  take the calliper b and turn the calliper round."
Yeah.
"It's like turning the car round to take off a bloody  bolt, you know?"
Oh I thought I'll do that to save another hose.
Anyway did that  course he said you'll have to bleed it out
Yeah.
Did the first one  right  this was on er  Wednesday  afternoon you see?
"So came to do the other side, went to the same routine  the nipple snapped off."
"So any rate I rang this fellow   I said eh he said  oh he said you've got no chance mate, he said."
He said you can drill it out but he said you  oh aye your  the thread gets damaged  and the seating
"That's right, yeah."
and he said if you get one leak on that your brakes
Yeah.
you're shot.
So a new calliper  how much do you think for a new calliper?
No idea.
Seventy pound plus VAT from Volvo's.
Bloody hell!
"So I thought there's no way, so I rang round the scrapyards."
Yeah.
I don't know  but they must of done it sometime.
"It weren't when, the other when we got all pissed?"
"No, but I mean"
Why's she think she's pregnant then?
"I mean, didn't they use anything for"
Yeah!
"But she  well she didn't, I mean she didn't tell me the intimate details or anything  I don't even know whether she has, she wo , she might have ju ge , been getting over dramatic or something!"
But she  but  her period was a week and half late  and she started well panicking!
"Yeah, well she"
"And you know , you know when we thought, yeah  well she'd, she'd just come on when she came down to my house  and she was really, really, really in a happy mood!"
"And er  you know, you know when we saw them two walking"
Yeah.
the other day?
"That was what she was upset about  she thought, oh dear,Scotty's a going to be a daddy !"
"Fucking hell,!"
I hope she hadn't done it that Saturday when we all were outside and we watching
"She might not have done it, done it  but like  she might have"
like
like  yeah.
"Cos you never know, I mean  Andrew  wipe spunk all over somebody, you know!"
"Yeah, I I should think she like  she's done some  done naughty things"
Well we all do  though
"and, yeah"
"If she's given him a blow job, I mean"
"But I mean, she's probably done something like that  and  she's just got over dramatic about it!"
Guess what  she's said she's gonna write to go on the pill!
Did she?
Well not to me !
"She did and she says, she goes, I wanna go on the pill while I've got the courage!"
But I don't think I can rely on myself to take them everyday!
"If you was there you could take them, too pissed I should think!"
Probably!
"So she said, Val said I thought  good for you mate, you didn't get pushed out  he's gone  they're all gone  till the new year innit?"
Well I wouldn't of wanted to go with them myself.
"Well not after that little escapade, nor would I."
"I wouldn't of thought so  I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a  I don't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway  and her sister said is she hadn't got enough money, she'd pay for it."
That's right  that's what Val told me.
She don't have time for him.
What?
She hasn't got a lot of time for him now.
Who hasn't  her sister?
Her sister.
No  she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well he is isn't he?
Well yeah.
Ah I mustn't I must admit I don't think I know any worse than him.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff  I don't think he
Oh yeah.
"means any harm, that's his way."
Well that's yeah but I I must admit I find it quite tiring.
Well he's always been pleasant to me  you gotta
I can honestly say  he's the sort of bloke I would sort of try not to get lumbered with at a party or somewhere like that   I mean I don't mind I didn't mind talking to her  but I find her
Well I find her  boring.
Yeah.
I find her very boring  although she's a very kind person.
"Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him."
"I'm surprised  you know, she isn't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been"
Oh yeah.
like this  that's it.
Let's face it she erm  I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Well she hates him!
Yeah.
She literally hates him!
Yeah.
"Oh wait, let's see what you gotta tell me today."
It's been a lovely day.

"Ooh I  number again, I'll take it out in a minute."
Yeah.
Oh no
"And er she said well, I said I'm ever so sorry but she's  anyway  so I thought oh God!"
That's a step in the right direction.

Okay.
"Well I couldn't do nothing about it really, she said well that'll be sorted out in  she said I'll treat it, we're now sorting it out today what we're doing."
Mm.
"So I said well I hope it's not gonna be too long I said cos we're not a  a very big firm  and I said, you know, we want the money!"
She said well I should imagine that's what's happened  the paper work here has got muddled up with the other.
Oh.
So she said I'll do I'll sort it out straight away for you  well I had a phone call at
"eight o'clock this morning, who the hell that was from, I don't know, I was out the washing line  I come flying in but I never got it, and nobody's rung."

"So with that  call it coincidence, call it what you like  but one of these low-loaders come in  to pick up a caravan or something like."
"And I said there you are, he's there waiting to pick my caravan up."
He was empty you see.

He sold me the caravan.
And I went in there.
I says now  have you had any visitors from   a couple of nights in my caravan.
No he said.
I said I think somebody's saying some untruth to me.
I said because I've got a tape here  and there's a couple  who'll go to court if necessary.
And I said is my caravan being cleaned weekly  as people go out if they've got it for a fortnight fortnightly.
Yes he said.

"go ahead I don't, no I don't mind people smoking in here, it's fine by me."
"So er oh dear, oh I'm a bit frazzled."
Frazzled?
Yeah I mean it er  I was up till about two A M so er
"What, marking?"
No.
Mess around with your make up.
So I can get loads of homework done  and erm  like I can count that as one of my nights in.
Mm.
So that'll be quite useful I reckon really  as well as getting a bit of money.
"Well, oh my mum's having such a fit about like  on our er, exam leads  like er  she goes to me this morning, like my da , her and my dad were talking about it  she is saying, and she'll do it!"
Cos me

Mm.
"the keys with her  and take the er, plug off the telly  so we've got nothing to  occupy us!"
And she's serious as well!
Mm.
"Because  we're both such weak willed people, honestly!"
Same as me.
"I mean, I've got a, I've got a French homework that was due in today  told Mrs  I'd left my book at home, I accidentally bought the wrong book!"
"So she goes, I want it first thing tomorrow morning, and I mean like  this is talking like, we're talking major  here!"
Mm.
"And like  I started doing it, I'll read it out in English  I started writing it in French  came to a word I didn't know and thought  ah leave it!"
And I've left it now!
Mm.
"So like I'll go in, half nine  I'll get a drink, you know  sit down, look out the window, see if Scott's in, phone him up if he is  say helloee darling!"
"Ah, erm"
By the way I'm not pregnant !
God this subject keeps coming up doesn't it?
I'm gonna
Oh!
get dead bored now!
Whoever it is that's listening to our interesting conversation!
"Don't you reckon that'd be dead boring though, I mean  I mean"
Have you rung up already?
Yeah.
Can't say owt if you
Tt.
What you tell them?
Slept in?
Told them I had migraine.
Tt.
"I'm running out of fucking excuses now, I'm going to write book out."
You'll have to remember what you've used.
Your grandma's dead four times.
Poor old grandma .
I'm a rotten bastard aren't I?
No.
Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
"I tell you summat  I'm getting fed up because every time I don't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I don't feel well, I don't want to."
"It was an arrangement we had I, I wouldn't phone in  cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages  if I phone in."
"So I says I wouldn't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I don't mind, you know, losing a day's pay."
I said I'll pay you mysen.
"So er  she says yeah fair enough then she won't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her."
Yeah.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I don't have to wait three weeks for mine so  next time I don't feel great  I'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
"No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years."
Why's she looking at excuses not to do it like?
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I can't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So
Do you know that bit where he was ha looking over the diving board and stuff?
That was Jonathan to a T.
We went swimming with Jonathan the other night and he got up on the top board and sort of and he was sort of like hanging on to the bar like this  looking over
"Oh god, that's  like."

"Oh I know what you mean  you went in like that and your back, your, your legs went like that there?"
Yeah.

"But I've jumped off the second one, I haven't dived off the second one."
No way.
"I got up, I remember like I'd just  I'd just learnt to dive off the first one  like I was running down like, yes!"
And I got up with the intention of diving off the second one and I went no!
Jumped off it.

You'll end up with some real wanker like.
"Ah no then, no."

"I, I just said to him, when he said we've got these census point ahead I said well  we've got certain restrictions, you know, we've certain rules and regulations we've gotta comply with  I mean I didn't reel off any of this  blah."
"But I said oh, are you familiar with setting up roadside interviews and  for this type of thing?"
"Oh yes, we've got such and such a fella out there that does nothing but that out all day long."
And yet they didn't have any signs  so I think he's talking through his hat.
But what he probably means is that they set up signs for
Yeah.
"you know, roadworks and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I mean I would have thought they've gotta comply with the same
Yeah.
the same sort of things.
"I think the thing is, actually, just thinking about it, there will be a Welsh version of this  if there is one if you see what I mean?"
Yeah.
"If there isn't one  then we, we er er it  er  oh mind you I suppose there's no hassle to them to put a Welsh thingy, anyway I'll look at that."
"Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along?"
Yeah.
What I did  was I got  I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and  I mean if you want to use  Chris

Then on the Tuesday I went to the hospital.
And erm  she phoned me up on the Sunday.
She said I'm  I'm just ringing to tell you Joy that you didn't get  you you haven't been successful with your application this time.
"But she said  erm I wanna just tell you  all the others  that haven't made it, we've just said well I'm sorry."
That's it.
"But, with you, we feel you've got so much to offer  and we don't really wanna just say no and  and  and it would make you feel oh blow it I'm not gonna do it."
Mm.
"She said I feel that  there is a place for you in the health, in this mental health service."
But she said  what it is is basically we're all just starting from the bottom because this new idea of where they're buying small homes and making them small communities
Yeah.
erm  they're all starting from new.
They're all been institutionalized up till recently.
That's right yeah.
So they're gradually buying houses in certain areas.
And she said I'm sure you'll get in.

Oh yeah.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Made them  yeah.
"Well, to me if a child has got a   by all means encourage along  but you shouldn't push them into anything cos  later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything  you know if they"
I don't know.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gonna do well and
"Where do you draw the line between  you know, not sort erm  encouraging and not"
Well I do it all look at  it's the way you say it.
"Well that's what I'm saying, so perhaps the kid was right in what he said."

"Yes, but it doesn't"
"I just mentioned it er  we have we have had a suggestion from B class judges    that er  that the B class judges can show at er  an, an open show  providing, providing they declare beforehand"
Providing they declare their interests
"it is what I've always thought for a long time that  somebody like Brian   if he's not  if he's not showing at our fish  at our show, even as an A class judge, I, I  fail to see why he can't  judge at our show  it's, he goes to Skelm and, and judges there and our fish will be there or    strange really when we're struggling for judges that, that we don't do these things."
"Yeah, but we're looking at the financial side, aren't we really?"
W with Brian
"Well I know  I mean it  we're struggling to get judges, aren't we, and it's not going to get any better, it's going"
No.
"to get worse if anything, not better  the way things are going."

"And I went, there's a message here for her, if Rebecca phones, I went, yes, I'm Rebecca, oh, right, okay."
"You leave a message like, and it's like, erm, I'll pop over and see you,and I was like, I mean, he just paused for breath, and I went, well, what time, and he went, well hang on, the message hasn't finished yet."

"Last year, reading week was, it seemed for ages, wasn't it?"
"It did, didn't it, yeah."
"It seemed weird, it was so,oh, it's nearly November, I'm getting worried."

"Oh, that's alright."
"Half my year's gonna be gone, and I'm sort of, going for the third year, and it's really heavy."
Oh.

"I swear blue in the face that I'm right, and then somebody comes on and goes  oh yeah."
"Well, put it this way, if it isn't on Sunday,"
"it's a bit of a long time, because I come back January the fourteenth, fourteenth, and I've had all Christmas off, haven't I?"
"So I'm gonna be back, like a week, you think they'd make it a bit more  so I've done most of"
"No, I know what I'm thinking of, I'm, if ever, I'm thinking of revision week, cos that was a week, we  wasn't it?"
Yeah.
And then we had another revision week in June.
"See , there's two revision weeks, and a reading week."

It's  for you with kids.
"But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn."
"Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home."

"Oh and they show two things  so y you'll have to see if there's any correlation between the two  is there any correlation between rainfall and temperature, and is there?"
When rainfall goes up does temperature up and vice versa?
Dunno just gotta describe them.
"Well that's what you have to say, is there any correlation between"
What does correlation mean?
They all correlate.
Yeah.
It's connection isn't it Kev?

What's level six?
"Well correlation I've just done that with all my children, you should be level six, no good doing it, you should be it  Want you to do two pieces of work for Monday and  all the same level, so there's an extra  two you've got to do."

Yeah.
"I've got some Marmite, and I'm just"
Do you want some jam?
"Claire's got some Vitalite, I think."
Anything will do.
"Mike organized it, for me to go over there and then  I didn't need to be there at all, cos noth nobody turned up."
Ah.
So I've er
I'm sure they're really grateful for you
I don't think Maryanne even knows I've been there.
You don't think what?
Maryanne knows I've been.
No.
"Do you arrange it all, then?"
"I think, yeah, well he rang me, so erm, I think she was expecting, I think they, when they left the house this morning, he was thinking, he'd be able to get home in time for it, and erm, then he got to work and the day wasn't, hadn't worked out the way he expected."
"And like, did you hear about that unexploded bomb, in the Second World War, the two thousand pound bomb on the"
News last night.
No.
"Do you want tea or coffee,?"
"I'll have a coffee, please."
"There was two thousand pound, Second World War bomb, they found in Walton, which is right near the River Thames which is, like, past Hampton Court, and Mike said that he'd have to go out there today, and it's er erm, this guy who he works for, owns a Leisure Centre right beside where this bomb is."
So he'll need to go down there with his associates and had to evacuate the Leisure Centre.
"Oh, really?"
They just found this bomb and they were going to have a controlled explosion at the car park
Oh.
"So, that made the day a bit more interesting, but he's been stuck with er, all these upper class councillors that telling him what his job is, and"
Don't go down very well.
"He said, he's not impressed, and er, I think the idea that go   at a meeting today,"
"Yeah, turn that power off before you do any more to that  it's silly isn't it ?"
Erm.
Yeah.
You know what you're getting because we've had it before.
"So then I got back on to Gwyllam  and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you  someone there be willing to do the  from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem."
Right.
But he doesn't know any details.
Okay.
Er you know I mean just like we don't.
We don't know dates or anything yet do we?
No.
So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr .
I think that's probably the best.
And just let these do the transporting because this  this fella honest to god he was doing me head in.
"Erm  saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it."
Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times  trying to impress me.
So let's stick to Mr .
We know where we are with him.
"Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that."
Right.
Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
"And we, we've got to wait for erm  Mel  to be in tomorrow."
Haven't we?
Yeah.
And we're obviously going to ask him to
"He, he"
to go ahead with it.
"looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after  the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme."
Mm.
They have a sort of programme of their own  on er doing counts on roads.
I mean  a and most of it's done through the county councils.
"So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment."
"Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided  Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us."
"But then again, if, even Kay over there with  she said something about er, oh we've been out, but, I told you I went to a  last Monday."
Yeah.
"and she said something about, oh we've been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God, she said he's turning into a right old man, and you know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't,"
Exactly.
"She didn't realise what she was saying as such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know."
"Yeah, well he is, what ten years."
Thirteen you got from 'er.
Thirteen years difference.
"She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's twenty-nine."
Same age as our Kim
Yeah.
"Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year, won't she?"
"You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just leaving it."
yeah.
He's really forty-three this year.
Don't work.
"He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be thirty this year."
"The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about,"
Look George
"if yo if one's fifty over sixty,"
He's plucking his feathers out.
then it works.
"But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does."
But when you get into your forties
"Well, it's like, I mean like,"
It works.
I'm  me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago.
"I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even two and three years ago and  somebody'd said to me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said, yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out all night, do what you want."
"Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a  apartment."
"Yeah, that's right, yeah."
Yeah.
"And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went to see Squeeze."
Oh aye.
No it's not as if you're all close is it?
No.
And I mean we haven't seen them since ours hardly have we?
No
Watch this fool.
Ram him off the road.
Oh I had a really good day today.
"I didn't go till about  half ten  ah no cos I had a few letters and stuff to write first  and I thought right I'll just take me time  and, cos I wanted to  I didn't wanna go faster than  you know than I should, I should have done sort of thing cos I wanted to time it properly."
Erm it took me an hour and a quarter.
And it's exactly sixty miles into the middle of Caernarvon.
So I
"And that's where the survey's gonna be, right in the middle is it?"
Well no but that's where I had to go.
See you can allow a few extra miles for getting
Oh.
to the others.
So you wanna allow yourself a  an hour and half really don't you?
"Do you think, or not?"
"Well I don't think so because that, I mean there won't be any traffic hardly"
No.
when I'm going so I'll just allow the same.
And then I should do it in an hour.
You know  I'll be leaving at about half five.
"No, not b about quarter past five I'll be leaving, five to quarter past."
That's allowing a  a good hour and a quarter.
But it's not gonna take me longer at that time of the morning than it has done today at eleven o'clock or so is it?
Coming home it took me a bit longer cos it was all that delay at the  hill.
Oh aye that's right I heard it on the radio.
Yeah oh it's pathetic .
"Oh no the rest of it, it's not too bad, it's not a bad journey, it's quite pleasant really."
So I went straight to the  county offices and saw the rooms you know where we're going to
Who's A T S?
Tyres and .
"You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope?"
"Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them."
Precisely for that reason I should think!
"Well wha what he said was  he went up there  there's erm  could they  put on the front wheels  to the back  and the back wheels to the front  didn't say anything  the bloke said, well we can't charge you."
Oh.
And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that.
So this is isn't what it's all about?
"Well, that's how it all come  see he owes them a hundred and seven pound  and er"
when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it.
Oh.
Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it  he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said  we can charge you  but we can't charge you labour.
That's ridiculous innit?
"Yeah, so he said well  charge me for wheel balancing then or something  no he said, we can't do that."
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
So he said will you do it for nothing?
And he said it's not a charity case!
Could you pay him to do it?
He says no.
Said fair enough  he said and with that I come out the garage.
"Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?"
He does now.
So erm  he's phoned up me   your money  cos he said they daren't put me in court you see.
Well that's a ridiculous  thing to do!
"Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further?"
Yeah  yeah well you see what he said was  he could not see how they could warrant   him  that sixty odd come as interest   justify doing it.
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Possibly about a year I think.
Cor!
My God!
"So he said, I'm not having that!"
Yeah.
"and er, he's got to do the drinks."
"Oh, that's good, isn't it?"
"So he gets twenty five pound for the for the night, and he hasn't got to start until about nine o'clock anyway   so erm that's, that's something for him to do, isn't it?"
"Oh, that's really good."
Yep.
"erm, Jay's sister, Tamsin it's her twenty first on Monday, so he was, like, write out her birthday card, right, and he was like, trying to write something funny, so he was constructing this thing, like reading it out to me, and  half an hour when I first got there."
Yeah.
"And er, it was very amusing, but repeatable, half the things he wrote in it, and erm, it's very, it was very good, but, he is quite good at that when he sets his mind to it, it usually takes him about three days to do it, but he does like to er, write messages in people's cards."
And er
"He's a laugh, your brother."
"He's a nut-case.  up to him  seems a  it's Mark, I couldn't believe it."
"It was like, get on to those bloody phone people, he said, I was on the phone to them for half an hour, yesterday, he said  haven't turned up, he said, and I organized m I work around  and everything."
"He said, and then I got you to come along, he said, and it's all for nothing."
"It's always the bloody way, innit?"
"And I said, well go and pick the phone up  Oh, yes, we have got a phone, actually"
Before you start whacking your breasts.
Mm.
I haven't had a phone all week.
"Which it isn't the easiest thing, when you've just moved into a place, is it?"
No.
"I mean, erm, you know, at least we're all sort of easy walking distance of one another."
"Like we council with our daily contacts through college, but"
That's true.
"like, you know, everyone's far away from them."
"Exactly, they"
"Quite a distance, haven't they?especially for emergencies."
"It's worrying,"
Mm.
isn't it to think that
Yeah.
someone can't get hold of you.
Another one at Holgate Road fifteen erm York Road Acomb twenty.
Walmgate twelve pounds and Hull Road twelve pounds.
Er Fulford Road eighteen pounds.
Presto Main Street Haxby eighteen pounds.
Another couple at Acomb for twenty pounds and then they also give just a cost for Ripon and Scarborough.
So I don't know about anybody else but that's cheaper than I expected it to be.
Yes absolutely.
And the fact that they're several in Fulford that I'd say are very good sites.
I always read them erm when I  about Fulford .
At Fulford Road or Fishergate would be the best one to go for.
Yes.
Are these the sort of the like to the end of bus stops?
Well from what I can gather the cheaper one on Fishergate is a bus stop size one.
There's one actually at the bus stop by the Police Station and there's another one on the corner of the erm just before you turn into  Terrace there's there's a free standing one outside the shop there.
And I think the eighteen pound one is probably the big one on the side of Jacksons building.
Erm actually high up you know full size billboard.
Which I'd say is less useful in fact than the little ones.
I think the little ones might  noticed.
Cos I mean I all whenever I'm going travelling into into York and they've changed that billboard I always look at it.
Yeah.
People in cars will notice the big one a lot better .
Yeah that's true.
Which is our target audience
Obviously yes.
wait at bus stops.
Right could be a policy decision this couldn't it?
Anyway I suppose before we decide we really need to know how much the National Party are going to charge us if anything for the actual posters and what the posters look like.
Yeah.
And how many posters they what size and shape of posters they're doing which will affect which site of course.
That's right.
no good.

"Yes, I was born in  Lane at  Lane on the eleventh November, nineteen seventeen."

"Yes I know er yes I er er I er er I, I think it's a good thing  that people, if they ask for information, you've got to buy books to get them."
But what's aggrieved me is that he's just waltzed off with it  and not

But they had a Mini before the Metro and er  the day they bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if you buy a Mini in the next few days

"The dust wagon came up to the warehouse today, the usual   they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin in the back"
Oh yeah.

all over the car park.
So the driver said can I use your phone?
He came in  and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet.
He got through to the  base camp to find out when the  chap was coming to fix it.
"Five minutes later he came in trying to tell  tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just  you know, brains"
Mm.
Hand picked for the job I should think.

Well if you go into a D I Y store you'll find it's a mahogany stain  I don't know if they really make mahogany .

Yes you'd probably gauge by the price I would think.
Yeah.
Plastic

Cycle parking is actually  I wish they'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you didn't have to sort of tie it up to some lamppost or something
"Yeah, yeah."
There's hardly anything
I mean they could give you a decent stand to put it in cos I hate those ones at Sainsbury's.
"Cos if you've got anything heavy in the bag, the bike falls over."
The ones at the library  as well.
Er and they ought to have a little shelter over it to stop your saddle getting wet  if it rains .
"I've got, I mean I've got my spots where I park it, I, it at Woolworth's and outside the post office  because it keeps it dry."
And out of the way.
All the roads into town are just awful.
"I mean the Dunmow Road, Hockerill"
Oh yeah.
You know  really scary.
You know you get asphyxiated with petrol fumes and then you get the danger of being  thrown off your bike.
cycling
Yeah  they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to Hockerill lights.

You must to  cat.
Just walk  slowly in the middle of the road.
So that there's no way they can take overtake on the right or on the left.
"No, there's always been a mandate workshop, explaining why, you know, what our mandate is ."
"You, you did give once to a group a few years ago."
"Yes, I've done the mandate workshop, yes, and I've done it with other groups too."

"that they thought they could develop and hav hold events on, and er, he said, like we, we came up with some good ideas, put forward some ideas, really good ideas, for things to do on this land, and he said, the trouble is that all these councillors back on to these pieces of land, and he said, er, they don't want people coming along and enjoying themselves on it, because they want to go and walk their labradors on it."
"Oh, I see."
"So it might disturb their neighbourhood, you know, so they weren't very impressed with his ideas."
Ow.
"So er, he hasn't had a very good day at work, a bit fed up."
"But Alfie's coming down tonight, and they're going out."

"Oh, that's good."

"Yoghurts are expensive, aren't they?"
"They are, that's why I got that offer for three big ones."
"Actually, they did have six for fifty nine P in Iceland, but the date was up on them like, Sunday, and I thought, I won't get through all the them."
"Once they start going off  it's not really worth having them, so."
Bought me trusted cottage cheese.
"Some parsnips, some carrots, cucumber, onion, apples."
"Didn't get the  plates, I'm gonna get them tomorrow, it's too awkward to carry   but I generally get nothing exciting."
Just the bare essentials.

"Oh you can't have two weeks at once you know  but over there you gotta get rid of your holidays before December, you gotta get rid of them otherwise you lose them."
"Take them, you've got to get rid of them!"

To get what?
That's like this woman at work
To get .
But he's such a dork I'm taking him off it.
And they're letting him keep linear.
Cos linear is just consignment stock and you know  job there.
"Sally  the lass who's taken over the buying for precision bearings, is a great lass got on great with her, and Richard."
"And they want to come and see the factory, they want to go to  yeah, it fell down cos Richard was too busy at the end of last year, fine get that sorted and i Sally was dropped in the crap by  right at the end of last year, came on  five sets of bearings, I could've done 'em in two weeks."
"I said I'll get you in two weeks, wallop wallop  It's alright,to do it, they have 'em back in a month."
"We're alright you know, they only way you'll get the business, he's like that, he talks like that, is if you can you know offer a big price saving."
That I'm afraid that's one thing you can't do
Alright.
even if it means that this year Yeah yeah.
Er
From my own point of view I want the business but bearing in mind what's happening I'm asking you before I do anything.
Erm I
Should I let the dust settle first?
Yes.
So I'll leave it.
E you either either leave it or
"If I quote three or four quid underneath, he'll consider it and we may get an order in a few months time when the schedule runs out."
Do you want me just to leave it?
"I think what you could sensibly say, to them, is, Look, I gather you've had supply problems with"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos I was there when it happened.
And s n a look you won't have supply problems with us.
Mhm.
"And you could say, look what we've done with ."
Yeah
Competitors of yours.
Yeah.
"Competitors of yours, wanted bearings in a week, we got 'em bearings in a"
The problem the problem is that's happened with the design people.
Yeah?
Erm  the alchemist is conning people promising them that he'll turn base metals into gold.
"One of the people he's conning is Sir Epicure Manhom  who wants a life of ease and luxury and has been giving  the alchemist loads of money in order to tu to, to perfect this  and  funny enough the alchemist hasn't managed, hasn't managed to do this, to get the person's money."
Okay.
So that's who Epicure Manhom is.
"One day, when he is, somewhere back in act two, one day he is visiting the alchemist he catches sight of this woman, Doll, quite obviously a prostitute, probably an a an absolutely  erm  catches sight of her and says, I must quickly think up some reason why this woman is, is in the house  cos  Sir Epicure Manhom thinks the alchemist is a pure, homely  er priest-like creature yet in fact, he's running a whorehouse."
Okay?
"So,has it's worse than Neighbours ."
"Erm, think  erm  so he's sort of bluffing, okay?"
I'll just find a scene where he does this.
"Er er  in act two, scene three  okay?"
"Er erm  quite a long way, there's that, that line  erm  two twenty."
Okay?
"Face had just realized that Sir Epicure Manhom has  erm  seen Doll, which he shouldn't have done, and  Manhom calls Face out and says stay Lungs."
That's what Face is called at the moment.
I dare not Sir.
Say man what is she ?
Now Face is bluffing here.
A Lord's sister sir.
", pray thee stay ."
And he sort of bluffs a bit more.
She's mad sir .
"Still trying to explain why a Lord's sister is staying with the alchemist, okay?"
She's mad sir.
"Send hither, he'll be mad too."
"I warrant thee, why send hither?"
"Sir, to be cured ."
"You know, he's, he's thinking on his feet."
"He's trying to find reasons for this, this woman to be in the house."
"Meanwhile Sottle off stage is more, is calling why rascal?"
And Face  low you hear sir ?
He's going out to spend some .
Okay.
It's been at the Playhouse in past years though.
"Oh, well maybe."
"No, it wasn't, wasn't at  last year was it?"
Was it?
Well last year I did it at Latton Bush .
"Well what, what's the date?."
The seventh.
The seventh of March.
"Erm, so that's going to be before our next meeting isn't it?"
"So erm, if anybody wants to help contact me  ."
"Yes, what time, how much is, how much the day is it all day?"
I haven't any details either than what she said .
No .
"Erm, shall we erm see, what shall we do about this, it's Saturday the seventh of March, on a Saturday"
As I say I'll take a stall and I'll be there all day if anyone can help me.
"Right , well perhaps I, perhaps people could as actually come and speak to me afterwards, if they, if they think they could help at all, that's International Women's Day and all the local organisations have been asked to take part"
"Certainly , it's, it's for your ."
It was quite good last year.
"Yes, and we could sell our products and that's sort of thing."
"Yeah our things ,."
And that's a good way of advertising our .
"Mm, right, we've got a list, ah, you probably know, there's a list, a list isn't there, of, of sort of sale products, have you had that at all?, thing that came with us, with your, with ."
No .
"Yes I got it, but you may not of had it."
"I will pass it on, I will pass it on to you."
"We, we sell quite a lot of Amnesty products, a lot, a lot of clothing in every"
on tonight.
Yeah.
"Tee-shirts and er sweat shirts and all sorts of things so we can take them along, so that's, that's Saturday the m , seventh of March, if you think you can help at all see Avriel afterwards."
have you got a date?
"Yeah, got a couple."
"Anything you  we got some of those things, tell me, I'll bring it along  ."
Great stuff.
So what's the trick to the solo on there?
"I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just"
stuff's no problem but er once it starts  and get the medium stuff done as well
And there's the bit
so that when he gets up
"three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong."
"And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too."
Och it might be  I dunno  it might be with you bending it  that there's a bump on that string.
"Yeah on the, that's a thought,"
I think
Yeah.
But th it's something wrong with
It looks real good with
"That's what I thought, I thought you know fuck  looks like a bloody comic shop for a change."
That's why I stuck all the posters here   think the back issues  loosening up a bit it was getting pretty tight.
Nine hundred series.
"Well okay   Anyway I thought they'd ring here but  couple of people, some, two women   I thought it was Belfast Station"
New window display and everything.
The big guns and the big guns  I found a use for the fucking thing.
That looks good actually    I thought you'd be practising like mad  on your day off.
No.
I was playing last night   Gotta learn this  album I used to have ages and ages ago   fucking .
"I was really annoyed last night, I was getting really     There was all this like down tuning and up tuning like all over the place    That looks like Bart Simpson's dad"
Mm yeah.
got the hair
Probably
What is it?
Going to  tonight.
Are you?
I thought you'd given that up.
"No, back on again."
"Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other."
Oh bring them home then.
Bring them home and tell them that you're taking them home to air.
"And I don't suppose, they're not wet  you see."
"It's different  it's, they're damp  it's different if there'd been a hole and the water was coming in."
They're not saturated.
No.
It won't take them long.
That's what I says.
If those men wasn't working there I wouldn't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low
Mm.
and the atmosphere would warm up  right through the caravan.
Mm.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday
Mm.
"and done their work  and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday  the caravan's great now, the fires are alright."
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Mm.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ain't got the keys.
Cos they're not going to take an awful long time in a good hot room  to dry.
"the only thing again that I'm thinking of  what if we gets them out of the caravan  and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here  and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?"
Well if we rip them we rip them and I'll mend them.
Mm.
They are yours aren't they?
Mm.
Put a patch on them.
"Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said."
There's nobody can sleep in those.
"Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said  erm  yours was erm  the driest of them sort of thing."
Suppose they didn't bother with them.
"I told her off for not let not telling us she was ill and she said no, no I'm fine."
She's got her friend Sandy staying with her
When's Gareth back?
"He was he was in the house, I didn't speak to him though."
I just spoke to Shirley.
"Erm, Sandy's staying with her for a few days."
What else did she say?
Did you say about us going down or not?
"No, I didn't mention it, at the moment."
She's got Sandy staying now
"I asked her about the letter and she said she couldn't remember anything about it but she filled in something when they came back from Belfast and she said open it, so I opened it and it's one of these things er if you book to go to Dublin before May the whatever, the end of May, then if you went again in the Autumn, you you get er fifty pounds worth of vouchers or something, you go half price."
It's one of those con things like they tried
"Well,"
"Yes,wh why, I mean why would she go to Dublin"
Dublin
before.
What else?
And why Dublin when i when they were
When they crossed from
when they crossed from Northern Ireland?
I don't know.
Cos they're trying to sell things all the time.
"Anyway, she doesn't want it."
Martin still hasn't got his erm invalidity pension sorted out but he's managing alright at the moment.
He's filled in all the things.
I forgot er I haven't watched the television at all and I forgot to record what d'you call that thing? with the devil in it?
Well it was half way through when I came in
I forgot to I know I forgot to record it for you.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight
Does that rain mean it's off the coast or it's in our area?
And was that minus one just the Western side or us as well?
We'll get to know better with the local news after this
And I should imagine that the  light paper's the backing paper and that I've already glued my work on the   paper and my  my picture is already glued just there.
Can I have my sellotape back?
And I'm now drawing
Sorry.
a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the  work being put on.
Right this is a  decorative line round the sides of .
Does that make sense?
Just a white line.
Now you can make that look even smarter by making a second white line on the outside.
And then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border  for the second line  over the top of it which makes it thicker.
So you've got a thin white line on the inside and a thicker white line on the outside.
That's point one.
"Point two is this, that I made the bottom border there  er  about  be exactly five centimetres."
And I'm going to  put a guide line which is one erm er half  a centimetre from the side there .
"Yes Christine, can I help you?"
I've put two very  faint white lines there in white.
"You could use ordinary pencil, are you alright Bruce?"
Have you lost something?
Aye I was just
You then write your name in block capitals.
What's your name?
Jane?
J A Y N
?
Yeah.
"So imagine you were writing Jayne here  J  now it's a very long name, Jayne  and you have to put the title on there too, so I couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could I?"
"Probably that was a little bit on the, the large side anyway so  I would use lower case as well on this one, a bit like, a bit like junior school writing."
Do you know what I mean?
Then it'll fit on very easily.
You have to use your common sense.
"But you can see how a white pencil on that paper, that's going to look quite smart."
"Without, without the picture."
And did you
"So erm  I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's  reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music."
"So I thought, oh maybe I'm  reading too much into it."
"So I met him on Wednesday evening  Tottenham Court Road tube station  and er  chat, chat, chat."
"He, he talked so much we missed our stop."
In a very loud voice!
Did you?
Yes.
"Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!"
Oh oh!
"Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on"
Oh yeah.
"that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him  and I did not fancy him in the least  erm, it really made my skin crawl."
"And erm  first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching"
Mm mm.
"and moving away, like, hint, hint."
"But he liked gripped me on the arm and then  his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?"
. Oh it was just a nightmare!
"I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this."
"But, you know  I think it, I thought it was his  dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath."
"It was, I don't know how it smelt"
of moth balls.
"And he kept guffaw and going,"
and get this awful blast of moth balls !
Really?
"It was, it was a complete nightmare !"
Oh.
"And I, I wasn't prepared"
I wasn't prepared for   for it at all
Go on.
"because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving  and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?"
"And I pulled away and I said, well erm  I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it."
Oh!
in in a will or something
Yeah.
so they have the house and move into house
Then they pay a lot
but they're gonna taxed so heavily that they can't afford to live in it  under this new tax!
They've just gotta sell it!
I thought well  how  what a bloody shame!
Terrible isn't it?
"Mm  I mean er why don't they do it on like the square, how big your house is because that way you could  I know it's not far when  people who live in a great big old house  don't have to pay as much cos if this  I mean Uncle Trevor and Aunty  they've got a massive great house  haven't they?"
Have yeah.
But if this  because it's old or something they don't have to pay so much   the
the
rates
"The rates, yeah."
you know?
Yeah.
"But if you only went on the square foot it don't matter how big it was  well that's like, surely that'd be fairer?"
That's right  it wasn't
"Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have  don't have actual  they haven't got money  but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property ,though it don't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?"
If
No.
"you've got no money  we haven't got any money  but, you know"
Doo doo doo doo
I mean why should I I
Why should you be condemned just because you've put your money into your house?
"Yeah that's right, I mean some people don't"
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now .
Yeah.
Oh!
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you don't get taxed on that
Phone!
Oh I seem to remember something like that.
"Erm and the car just broke up in half and that was, that had been  er  welded but like the police are saying as  well as soon as they sort of get wise to what they're doing and they find a way to  er you know, get on to them, they devised something else."
"And the people doing it in these garages erm, you know like respraying and  doing all the welding and everything, really he said some of the things they were doing  if they did it legally they'd make a  good go of it"
Mm.
they were that good at what they were doing.
"Tell me was I dreaming  or did I see a sketch on T V where there's a car driving round, down the road being chased by the police  and the driver said to the passenger er here take this  and he says what's that for and he says it's to steer the car, presses a button  and the car splits"
It's an advert for Malcolm.
the car s the car split in two.
yeah.
A yellow car.
It's an advert for that film called Malcolm
Is that what it was?
about the
Yeah.
retarded lad that invented all these strange  and he did bank robberies with a remote control car.
"It was an advert, it wasn't"
But I did see it on the T V?
Oh you did.
Oh that's fine.
Straight after er  the advert for Del-boy when he says and you know what you can do with that.
Even talking about  trailers now.
Trainers?
Talking about te television trailers.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Not just the programmes.
There was a programme on about trailers the other night as well.
"Have you seen the, the advert for these trainers with no laces, you just tighten the thing up."
Puma Discus system.
They're out on the twenty  of March or something.
Mm.
I wonder how much they're gonna be a pair?
Dunno.
"But it's certainly er, certainly a valid question."
Yeah.
Woodrow Wilson
"Well, that's what Freud"
also  subject on.
But I know that  such a talented writer.
"You know, I mean, I was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after I'd read the book  I mean, anything I read about, I immediately say, oh yes, of course that's true, you know."
So.
"Well, next week, will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books, won't you?"
Yes.
"In which we shall be looking at, er another famous figure, but, but, er an even more remote and one, some people might say,mytho mythological one, namely Moses."
"So having done Woodrow Wilson this week, we will do Moses, next week."
We'll look forward to that.
"Is anybody Jewish, by the way?"
Right.
"Well, one year, I must admit, somebody in the class stormed out."
"The person started to read their paper on Moses, and I thought she was doing a good job of it, this guy suddenly got up and said, I'm Jewish, I'm not listening to any more of this, and stormed out."
"Oh, I don't see that."
"Erm, what is the most,"
Right.
"Er, that is in,that is in er, Hampstead,."
If you wanna get there
I'm just
"the easiest way to do it, is to take the underground to Finchley Road Station"
Finchley Road Station.
Mhm.
"And when you come out of Finchley Road Station, it's in a place called ."
"I may be able to give you a thing about it actually, if I've still got one."
"You can visit it, it's open  it's best to phone up and find out when they're open, because they're not open every day."
And they  interesting?
"Well, there's  I mean it's interesting, erm, it's Freud's you know, collection of, of classical and antique ."
"They, they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there, but it's not quite true, actually, it was earlier on."
"And we just, he knew a lot of the, he was interested in si singing and he just knew the words and and just sang round about the house."
Mhm.
And he just sang too.
You know that's how he he learnt.
So what were his favourite songs?
"Oh dear, he was  what would you say, I don't know  He liked the kind of  ballads, er he was a more a kind of bay he liked a ballad, so I really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that, just if a song interested him he just"
What do you mean by ballad kind of songs?
"Well more the slow, er songs, not the fast."
The love songs and things like that ?
Things like that.
Mhm.
"but I I never sang anywhere, I just sang round the house as well."
Mhm.
And it was really er I think it was really the pantomimes that I started singing
Was it?
"here, oh yes."
I never I never went out
Were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then as well?
"I was in the  Drama Club when I was when I stayed at home, but we didn't do pantomimes, we we did plays, one act plays, and three act plays, we did three act plays."
We never did pantomimes.
"And er  but that's the only time, you sang at weddings."
"So I said, Come on Mabel, sing."
Or my father would sing
So how long did you live in  for?
"We've , into the village, we lived out in the countryside till I was eight, and we come down into the I should say town shouldn't I, we come down into the town when I was eight and I was there till I was twenty two, and I came up here, when I got married."
"Mhm, is Leslie from this part of the country?"
"Les is from  oh well he was, I think he was three when he came up here."
"He lived in, he was born in Castle Douglas."
Mhm.
But I think he was three when his father was sh came up here to work.
What did his father do when he came here?
"Electrician, you know he still worked for the the electricity board ."
Mm.
"This government says ooh we can't afford that, no, it's a  it's a gimmick!"

"And it was supposed to be , if the audience was supposed to be voting"

"it's actually this one, it's not a"
and it is a good one
right John has written a story about his home  right it's a good descriptive story on how people live
until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it.
My home.
"I live in a tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister."
"Our house is made of wood and is dark green, we have a four windows and four doors."
It has got wooden roof.
"There is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm  because we climb the, the tree and climb it and  we play in the tree house today with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen here"
"Okay, right"
So if we cut out the one
they might
it might flow a bit more easily might it.
"That's good, it was alright apart from that you describe where John and"
are living well
"Yeah, I didn't see which sort of"
"No, did he describe the house though?"
Yeah
"Yeah, I think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear"
I think he could improve it just a bit Jonathan
"and then it might flow a bit more evenly, might it then, right Michael bring yours out now please."
"Just a minute John, right Michael I want you to read yours through once more for me please."
Do it about the monster
Monster from the marsh.
"When I saw the monster from the marsh, one night, I was, I was, I was frightened, I, I, I, I was  he looked liked a   when I saw him I ran back to camp and I felt frightened, I hid under my sleeping bag the end"
"Right, see Michael was describing that how he felt"

Frightened
You think that he came out quite

Aha
Specially with Palace I think they seem to think  but they really .
Should have finished them off in that first
Yeah   Can I just flick the light on for a second?
Thank you.
"Yes, see who  I mean  I can't think of anybody who's in the reserves who could do any better than the lot that are in, in at the moment."
Can you?
"Other than perhaps give Colleymore a full blooded  game, right?"
Doesn't he get a full blooded game at the moment?
"I think perhaps it's, it's worth it now."
"The season, I mean we're not gonna come top of the league are we?"
Right?
We've gotta make sure we stay in the first division but
I think we can afford to blood Colimore as a good one now.
"He could have this whole of this season to get used to playing, right?"
Yeah.
And then who knows what fireworks could happen the season after.
I mean  he's never gonna be a  when he's obviously another Bright.
Who wants another Bright?
We're supposed to  to the better style of play.
"No, I don't know."
Well why did we buy Gabiadini?
Why?
What would be the point of buying Gabiadini?
"No, well I, I mean you saw the point really."
"I mean  to pick I mean who, who  who could replace ?"
"He's, I, he, the way he plays is virtually unique, isn't he?"
So I mean you're not gonna say  well let's go and get another Ian Wright off the peg so fair enough.
But er  in the kind of situation where Ian Wright was very very good was in tight situations.
differently through se sheer speed and  but er I can see Gabiadini  I mean Ian Wright never flicks like some of the flicks that he does.
I mean some of the flicks are fantastic.
But erm there is a nice side to his game but god he doesn't half fade.
"Can you afford somebody that fades like that, I don't know it's"
"I think Buckingham Palace is lovely compared to Westminster Palace, beautiful old stone and the, and the shape of it and it's windows, it's beautiful  huge of course, there again the court then had loads and loads of er, there were ten ."

But certainly the main co-ordinators er
"Almost like the burglar alarm  you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in"
We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because
No
that'd be a mammoth task
If you have somebody like  somewhere like that
"I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know"
Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
Yes
"I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them"
"Well, this is something I've just done myself"
Yeah
"but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but"
"it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I"
Yeah
"think about it, but"
I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you?
No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
"So you know who they are, yeah"
Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm  out and then they just go through the system

Well when when it was first read by erm  it was mentioned that it had been written by the Green Party by radio four and the Guardian and the Independent.
And as far as I know that's the only coverage I've seen personally of it.
"Well I s I saw an article in erm the Green Alliance, a fairly shadowy organization , er mentioned in their newsletter."
It was it was erm promoted by the association of conservation of energy.
Mhm.
So I rang them up .
But that's yeah I haven't seen much.
Yeah it's supported by the
Well no they said they said prepared by er
Oh right.
What is the Green Alliance?
I don't really know.
I don't know who they get their money from but they.
I mean they used to provide the advisor to various secretaries of state I think didn't they?
Ooh
I don't know who they are really.
They send out this newsletter anyway.
But I mean the main the main I mean in it in certain quarters we've been down playing that aspect of it simply to get it through.
Sure.
But er all of the main organizations that have  you know World Wide  and Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and so on and Age Concern.
They all know they were all told that it's it's all a bit above board.
But in promoting it to MPs we've been drawing their attention to the kinds of organizations which in turn in their eyes just sort of represent that pyramid or structure of votes that .
And of course when it goes through they already have our our as it were
Yeah.
With a bit of luck and careful handling.
"And the MPs who who asked to put it forward including Alan  they they had to you know they came to Ron  to ask, Can we put your bill forward."
They all know Ron anyway .
He's a very old hand in lobbying er which shows it's how it's we've got it this far.
Mm.
Because he's known this labyrinth  rubbish that they cling to.
Okay shall we move on to billboards?
Mm.
can!
The sheep to cross the road and
Mm.
quite unusual!
I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
"I can remember when you'd see  a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away  and this would be  a flock of sheep."
"Course, they hadn't had  lorries in them days, they drive them on the road  and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs  and goodness knows how many sheep!"
"And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there."
"And er  if you see it was coming towards  of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way  course the dust still keep going."
But  but of course this was many years ago.
Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.
It's all done with cars.
You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
It er  oh!
"It used to be  occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time  different shows and that."
"So many sheep  or, ha  show time see, you see these flocks of shop  but now you always"
Been to a cattle market.
That's a long time ago because se the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!
I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here  and that down here at Upton bypass  and all
Oh yes!
what they call Upton bypass.
Yeah.
Oh it was er  cry over war wound!
Oh!
Horses will never be able to stand on it!
It's slippery and that.
What a state they were in then!
"My father had er, horses at that time and  my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses  they were talking about this one day and  uncles would say  well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that  road's were nice and solid."
"Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them."
"But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be."
Yeah.
An oh!
Do you think that makes any difference?
I think it would really in a way  and yet the people in  know how you sing so the  whereas the  maybe wouldn't know.
Mhm.
"And you would  you would be more, you'd be more nervous in case they they thought, Well she's terrible isn't she?"
"But it would also be fresher for them, you know"
Oh yes.
folk folk that know you either w might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before .
"They have heard it before, mhm."
But I've never  well I've never really
You've never
sang in  anything other than the pantomime that
Mhm.
"int he village you know, except maybe at  at the  Social or something like that, said, Come on up and sing and then I forget my words and  that's me."
"Do you like to know where, for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then  ?"
I do really.
"Aha, I do really."
If somebody's would l if somebody wanted me to sing I really would like to know er because
Do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you
"Oh I have a wee store, yes, but you see you don't carry them, I don't carry them with me, if I carried them with me I could sing  I could, well that's it,"
"If you did it more often maybe,"
"I feel if, yes, you would remember them an awful lot easier."
Aha.
But er
"What, how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then, I mean were they just things that"
"Just taking  aye, just songs that I liked and  I just er take them off tapes and, and records, and I just write them down,"
Do you do that all the time?
"Are you always, when you're hearing something"
Mhm.
you're listening
Mhm.
"thinking, Oh I'd like to sing that ."
"And I'd like to, aye, and I just  write it down in a  if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line, you know."
"Everybody comes from miles around, all the kids come and the parents last year, was it last year?"
Yeah.
"it look just like a ski resort all the bright jackets and the woolly hats and it was lovely, I mean they made it into, into an absolute skating ring for driving on"
Couldn't get your car up .
"Which, every, every thing went sideways, but it was such fun"
Mm.
"and the sun was shining and everyone had got pla plastic bags, anything they could get to slide on you know"
Oh yeah.
"they were going down our front lawn then down the, then down then down the roadway, cos it's a dead end you see, so there's not much , not much traffic"
"oh I see, oh you're alright"
"It's not, it's not when you get to the end of it  then there might be a couple of ."
"Yeah if you, if you're coming up you daren't stop the driver and there's things hurtling at ya, there's kids on sledges coming at you at about fifteen miles an hour and you'll have to try and drive around them and"
I'll stick to the old  what they've got in California then.
"Oh yeah, erm, oh I'd rather have our climate I think."
"It get up over a hundred, people killed"
Oh it's horrible isn't it?
it's a high death rate some .
"Yeah, yeah."
"Funny actually they couldn't, when the rescue people came they couldn't see where the damage was because of the dust."
Really!
"Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news"
Oh .
"This dust, this dust  in California."
"I have heard, I have read about it ."
"This dust , and a, what's it a hundred and fifty cars all piled up on top of one another"
Oh shit.
"and there's a lot of people isn't it, and they don't know how many's dead because there's so much dust they can't see."
Oh how awful.
.
Oh that's awful.
So.
I wouldn't like it that dry.
"Er, Brian , is also a regional director for Belfast and the serving areas of Belfast as well, okay?"
"He has sole responsibility for Belfast, but he does have regional directors going to  but Brian tends to cover a general manager role and  with  with erm  Dick ma ,."
"No, not Dick , who's in er  Belfast?"
"Tom, Tom ."
Yeah.
"And er  himself, run the Belfast operation  across all the regions."
"But sometimes, because he doesn't have hundreds of depots I think he's not regional, but that's my own fault."
Brian  is the Northern Ireland region.
Well done.
"Do get a, er buy a map, spend some money to get one."
You may have in your depot  you may have in your depot a map which  have pinpointed the T N T depots.
"Does any, has anybody seen one yet?"
Yeah.
The big wa waterproof one which you can draw on?
Yes.
Yeah.
"They're, er, well they're not waterproof"
Well
but they're coated aren't they?
"Er, so you can wipe them clean if er, you use a special pen."
"But, what I'm saying is, if you, salesmen particularly get one, you'll need one to get round the country  your patch, but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country  for deli , for delivery, cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport café, you haven't got a clue where the towns are."
"I mean, you know, where's your credibility?"
And write down erm  it.
"I know north of border, nothing happens south of the border and like but, but we do deliver down here so  do, do give yourself a little practise of that."
Now  I'm going to ask you to do another little test for me.
"Simple questions, ten questions, alright?"
"Do you want ta , tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again?"
And there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage.
Name on the top of the list.
Now  how many people have not seen a list of the
carriage yet?
Er erm
No.
"It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that  I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate."
"Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with  shower of rain"
"Mm, mm."
you know the sun is nice
"That's right ,"
"and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down."
"that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain."
That's right.
.
Get away with that now.
Yeah.
"oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy"
"Yes, you have."
.
"Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad."
"Oh, you  ."
"Yeah, but, you're mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been upsetting ,"
Yes .
"erm, when you think about after all ."
"Yes, exactly."
Mm
.
"Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important."
You've got to try and enjoy life.
"My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can."
"I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one"
Yes.
.
He's got the right out .
Too true.
He's got the right out look.
But we really need a candidate and there isn't anybody erm obvious who's in a position to do it unfortunately.
Fishergate this year?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes he does he lives in .
That's in Fishergate isn't it?
That's very true.
Must be an experienced person.
I don't know  cold candidate.
No.
Yeah the main difficulty is in is in the time period because it's it's quite likely that I mean I'd we'd been we'd been hoping that the target candidate could put in a reasonable amount of personal commitment to to the campaign.
"Other and if it wasn't for for me doing a course next year which would probably preclude me from doing that, I'd be quite interested."
But I haven't got I couldn't at this stage say I could do a tap next year.
Even the year afterwards may be not.
Well shall I ask Humphrey whether he's
Worth sounding him out.
Ask ask him if he'd like to do it.
We'll come back to you if we can't find somebody who's got more time I guess.
Okay that sort of covers I think what I need to know for for election stuff.
Because we've said we're gonna have a selection ballot.
Right.
Erm another thing I noted under any other business is green strategy document.
This Government one.
I mean this might not be a good time to chat about it.
I it's just that I remember on Monday morning hearing on the radio that it was being talked about that afternoon and of course immediately forgot to go and get a copy of the next day's Guardian and read about it and all the other
It's today's Guardian.
It's today's Guardian.
I've got it I've got it at home I can bring it in at the next meeting or whatever.
That would be good.
Or drop it into their office.
Possibly we could have later event if we'd read
Especially
"Okay, I think, I think that is, that is a point."
"Again, that came up this morning as well."
That
"Shakespeare's so central to our heritage i you learn him at O level, you learn him at A level, you get used to him."
"Erm  he's part of our language  and, and therefore, you know, to go on to Johnson it's very different."
"Like you say, it takes much more time to get into it."
But I think Johnson does make it harder for us.
There are no characters to get involved with  as the there are in  in Shakespeare.
We can't really imagine ourselves  you don't really have sympathy for any of the characters in the .
They're all  fairly sort of silly characters.
"Whereas in, in Twelfth Night or whatever, we might actually feel involved within the, the people in the play."
Certainly .
"Okay, well I'll leave all those up there."
"Erm  can you look at scene, act four, scene five in my edition."
Now I discovered this morning there is actually act four scene three in some people's editions.
Okay?
"Erm, so act fi act four, scene five."
"And the stage direction at the beginning of this, enter Doll in her bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom."
Has everybody got that scene?
Enter Doll in bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom.
Okay.
Can you divide yourself up into groups of four first of all please?
"I'll do it for you if you, you want?"
And leave a bit of space.
Right.
"For those who aren't totally sort of in control of the plot  and I probably should include myself as one of them, what's happening in this scene I want you to act out."
What's happening in this scene?
"Doll  is a prostitute, okay?"
First things first.
"Who is working with  Sottle  who's planning to be the alchemist, okay?"
So he's probably fiddled a lot of things  to get money from people.
"The alchemist is getting money, I'm sorry, for people who know this  inside out, but I'll just explain it."
Well he got promoted didn't he  he's stable now that child though hasn't he?
"Until they start tre tra blurgh they start treatment straight away don't they, these days."
Oh he's only twelve and ended up as one of the  smallest birds
"But it said I heard that it said chemotherapy well what's that's erm drugs is it, no that's radiation isn't it?"
Makes your
Oh y
hair fall out
well you wouldn't give that to a little baby would they?
Well you'd have to.
I thought they washed the blood out  changed all the blood.
Blood type  and that's what that other woman died  girl died of didn't she they
I was saying to Trevor  it's it's not very nice but it's rather so much better than than than having a cot death isn't it?
If you see what I mean.
Mm.
"I can actually imagine the feeling of going to a cot and then finding no  no the child was dead, that's awful."
Done  there was a  our school dinners today  I went into this  give you four pounds back  I get twenty two pounds sixty  Have you got two tens in change of a twenty?
I haven't got  five pounds
Have you got two tens you want to change for a twenty Paul?
No sorry.
That's been quite good that cos you know  I had a hundred and ten pounds left
Mm.
I only took out the palace because I knew  I'd given I'd written a cheque for forty
You'd written out a cheque
"and I've only just started, still got two people outstanding so I've got that forty pound and I put that into the building society and use that forty pounds  for months see  so it kind of like saved it for me, I've managed, had to do without it"
Yeah.
and er
When have you got to pay all that.
What mu a a th agent says I only have to pay it off a day
How much is it?
What just write a cheque?
Yeah  and that way .
Well you won't be there on the day.
"Get down, get down oh yeah, yeah."
I got through quite a few bits and pieces that was
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do
"Yeah, yeah"
Yes I know
Hello there
Good afternoon
how's the family?
Abnormal
"Yeah   At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and"
"I noticed the little girl with her, yes."
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today
Huh
"said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever  said I'm in a hurry  then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er"
Who you don't know from Adam
"A spaniel  which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T"
Off the lead like?
"Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide"
then he was watching him like this then he ran
Away from it or
"ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know"
"I said he  he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one"
"Spaniel , yeah."
"he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning  on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches"
Stitches
"so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know"
Mm
stop him getting dirt
keep going
in it or whatever
Yeah
And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress.
"Now I don't what Italy and those  Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn."
Mhm.
But  the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress.
"Yeah, I mean  now plays  of  Shakespeare and  they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing  well either First or Second World War  uniforms."
Yes.
It was very different then.
"Yeah, well it's just different  directors have different  things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or  they think that using a certain  well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will  will have more of an impact, you know will"
"One thing I was wondering about you know they  they talk about erm  in  Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the  the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used."
Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature
Yes.
"Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it."
Does that help with it?
I suppose
Pardon?
Well you should do.
And what about  I bought some  revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature
Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing  Romeo and Juliet.
So if you look in those you may find there's some help there.
Yeah.
"Come in, good morning."
"Hello, well what's your mum been doing to you this morning ?"
.
Well she's just after the
"Freeze her, freeze her tongue."
"having the flu, near a fortnight ago now, she's on these pills and she's  as bad as ever, and not sleeping again."
"She's finished them now, she"
She's finished those .
Let's have a look and see what you've one to your your poor old inside.
Dearie me.
Driving your mother up the wall?
So  that's the next stage.
Go.
can I start by asking your name?
Well my name is er Mr Laurence  er o of the Treasurer of the  in Edinburgh area.
And erm what was your date of birth?
"My date of birth was the thirty first of the, of the seventh, O nine."
Which makes me now approximately seventy six years of age.
What can you remember from when you were young about sort of housing conditions and
"What I remember of the housing conditions when I was then residing in Motherwell, a mining er community."
And known that particular time as the steel town of Scotland.
Was erm the whole town taken up with these sort of two occupations?
"Yes, it was all mining and steelworks."
Was all .
"In fact the Ravenscraig, present Ravenscraig was built up on the first place from a steelworks known then as Corral Steelworks."
Mhm.
"And D L Steelworks and Lanarkshire Steelworks, these er steelworks, all amalgamated which is now known as the Ravenscraig Steelworks."
Mhm.
What erm what kind of education did you go to when you ?
"Well I, my education was in a small er the local school, School in Motherwell."
Mm.
"And they were only a s s a sort of infants and secondary school er there, and you ."
"There was no, all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to, had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate, that was the only certificate issued in those days."
A qualifying certificate.
Er how old were you when you left the school?
I was er four I left the school at fourteen years of age and I was down the pit the following day.
The following day?
Mm.
What do you remember about working in the pit?
Well the working in the pit and the first and the first time I went down the pit er the pit was er John Watson's number four colliery in Motherwell.
And er I went with my dad and got into the cage which takes you down to the pit bottom and er er er immediately the cage left the surface it just dropped like a stone and I myself was frightened that the bottom of the cage collapsed completely.
Because my stomach come up and met my heart
oh shit.
"said, he said, yeah, he said, it'll be ideal in here, he said, I can put, he said, put a full lock on door, and he said, I can come in here, he said,and so I thought, ah."
"Yeah but, there's not many people that you can"
"Sasha, behave."
I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent 'appy.
"Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in, you know,"
Rushing about
"There's that much, there's that many people out of work, there's and"
"you know, there's that many pressures on people."
"I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean, like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per cent happy at all,But like, er, like some people I can't  if you get upset, some people eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go into recluse, some get  and like Colin,"
"he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a raving sex mania, he"
"I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me  out of a bed."
"He takes all, takes all his"
Why didn't you stop
No I think every
I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults.
Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
"I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either they go in and make  share, but if they work all day."
"No, it's not er, it's so much  I mean, he's at work all day,and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down,"
Yeah.
and what happens.
"He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, can't abide"
That's right.
Summat wrong somewhere.
Now look at our Margaret and Peter.
"They've got no family, so they've got no pressures like that, they haven't got any money problems  well they're not 'appy."
They live two entirely separate lives.
"Yeah, I know."
There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
Convenience.
Innit it.
"Yeah, it's convenient"
"Come on, there are rude words in there."
I mean
I grinned at farts.
Good!
Okay.
"Brunt, and a bit of a  at the moment."
Erm
"I mean Shakespeare did not, correct me if I'm wrong, use words like fart and, certainly doesn't use words like fuel gauge, have a leg over things like that, and things like, okay?"
So it's rude language.
Which is funny.
"I mean, we are all er very sympathetic at the end of the twentieth century, but, you know, we can still laugh when somebody says fart on stage."
Erm  there are other examples of that.
"You'll be glad to know that  in line four and five,What to do?"
"Lick figs out of my   he's actually saying lick piles  from my  and, you know the audience replies  fig  fig ."
"And the actor could, you know, draw attention the part of the anatomy he's talking about."
"I mean, this is not"
"this is not his sense of humour but it is visual, it involves the audience."
"Like, if you break off a line like, lick figs out of my  something, you're getting the audience going because the audience is supplying the  rude bits."
Okay?
Any other  things that were a problem about that clip?
Okay.
Forget that funniness.
Why is it different from Shakespeare?
What's the difference between that opening scene  and say the opening scene  in Twelfth Night or Winter's Tale?
Were they di different?
There's no asides  view.
Right.
That's another problem actually I hadn't thought of that.
"It's all  but everybody's  erm  everybody's involved from the word go, so  and the structure the  so think about that point."
"No, are no asides."
"Erm  I suppose there are later on in the play er th characters speak to each other and say very good that stupid berk over there kind of aside, but  what you don't get is  any structures of characters  as such."
You never get told what different characters are like  in th er by somebody else.
"Oh yeah, Jean told me"
"she said no , Jean said oh I can't walk that, have a bloody heart attack she says, so they put her in a trolley"
"they put her in a bloody trolley and oh course she said, this woman said erm"
said she might be small she said but she ain't half put on some weight you know
Oh yeah
you know?
Yeah
"So I said well I don't, I don't look at her and I sort of see"
she said yeah she said sorted that out and put her in a trolley
Yeah but she had to walk back that way didn't she?
Did she?
"Yeah she went to, she went to the shops and got one of those trolleys, she said what for?"
"She said I want to go to Minehead now, what she said it's only just up there, yeah I know but I've, I've bloody got to climb down there and bloody try and get back she says, er"
"well it's not that she, it was affecting the drink she had you know"
Oh I see
"she said the drink, the drinks are quite expensive down there"
"Yeah, I'm glad they took their, took their own"
"Yeah cos what, what they said like, their own, cos they run out of wine at the bar  and er, they went in the supermarket and got two bottles of wine and kept them on the table you see"
Oh
"so, they said"
what was it?
"The wine that have in the bog, is that a cheap wine?"
Yeah
"Well they ran it like that cos they said at the bar we can sell you a bottle of wine for seven pound fifty though, so he said you bugger off he said that, went down the supermarket and get our own like"
Oh
"and of course the bloke that were drinking that he kept, then they buy a"
bottle and erm they used to queue at the table that for the
you know
Oh yeah
used to just keep topping that you know
I thought they'd be more into spirits than wine
"Well there were spirits weren't there, vodka and all that, you know, no I suppose one or two drunk the old wine you know"
South Africans.
Now controversial stuff here in the Sporting Life David Ashforth.
Now Jerry Bailey the man who rode Ah Kong This is at a press conference after the Breeders' Cup.
Jerry Bailey typically articulate was being asked about his success on Ah Kong He described how he had moved alongside a European ridden horse.
He didn't know which one it was he just knew it wa was a European rider.
How did he know that?
The Americans all sniggered.
Bailey smirked a bit.
Well he replied he was kind of flopping about.
And everyone laughed.
Well all the Americans did.
We didn't.
That was Walter Swinburne he was talking about.
"And Bailey's comments are backed up by the trainer Derek Meredith who says American jockeys are better, they ride closer to the horse they're neater and they are stronger too."
There was a warm hum of approval from the American hacks.
"You were there John, what did you think of all that ?"
I wasn't part of the warm hum of approval
I don't suppose so.
and Mr Meredith was a failed jockey in England.
He ended up riding a few jumpers in France so its erm although he's a good trainer now I don't think he's an authority and it's poppycock er frankly.
But when  appear over here they're a great success.
Is there anything in it?
Oh of course they're of course they are a great success.
They are top class jockeys.
But our top class jockeys in America do not flop about they use a slightly different style.
Admittedly they're a little bit less streamlined but if you're going to say that that makes a serious difference
but what's the difference in the courses
as well over here that our our guys have to cope with.
true
The tracks in America okay we go over there and we say they're tight they're quite difficult to ride.
"There's nothing like an Epsom, there's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with"
Yes.
everybody saw was not the
Mhm.
fit strapping Heseltine which I wished
You looked terrible.
which I wished to portray.
But this sort of tottering wreck.
Yes.
"You know, hobbling to the helicopter  it was my"
foot which had had been had gout induced.
Nothing to do with the heart at all.
"Anyway, Sod's Law you know."
that's politics.
But you did look you did look truly awful in that picture that appeared in the newspapers you looked as if
"Well my real real girlfriends wrote and said, Michael, you've got lovely legs."
But did you think you were going to die?
I mean was it
No no I didn't.
"I mean I must be honest, I did not feel that frightened erm it wasn't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize, you can become a heart attack bore."
Very easily.
"Everybody who's had any sort of tremor or experience or much worse, they're all individual and it's no use me talking to you about my heart condition, because you haven't got my heart."
"Erm e e they're all individual and mine I think, looking back, was erm erm er a light er experience and I mean as I've said, the  the erm er w this telescope they shove up you, er I mean, Chris Patton had the same thing."
Erm is local anaesthetic in the groin.
"Up goes the telescope, you're lying there you know, and the doctor told me, he said, Do you wanna watch?"
Do you wanna watch?
"And I said, Ah."
You know.
Anything but.
Absolutely.
But erm anyway that's it's all it's all now a few a few months ago.
"Did it change your perspective on anything, on life, on politics, on what you're doing in in in the job?"
"Well I suppose erm well I  I I I mean I remember er ludicrous really, sort of thinking of what I would say at the Tory party conference while I was lying in  that hospital in Venice."
And I actually made some notes .
"Maybe just locally, at local garages but as far as, far as being the all national or anything like that, there was never  anything I  with the tramcars."
"Were the erm the relations with the bosses and the workers quite good, on the ?"
"Very good, very good."
Oh.
"Even with the inspectors too, there was always a good er  going with the, the people in those days."
Mhm.
And was this quite a well paid job?
"Well it erm it was average, it was average."
Yes.
And er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that?
Oh yes.
Ex exactly the same as  going to the present day.
You had the split shifts and the down shifts and maybe we were called for er a
"What did you do after you left, you left the trams?"
After I left the trams then er I went er I went away to East Kilbride.
I used to work for a certain er c er creamery there.
Er
"getting milk, separating milk er pasteurizing milk and  like that."
Was East Kilbride one of the erm one of the new towns?
"it was er now it was, now at the start of the new town er present East Kilbride a new town, it was known as a new town and it was just starting to build up."
And I had better chances of getting a proper house for myself and my family which was then two daughters and my wife and I.
So we actually went there to better ourselves and try and get a h a reasonable house to sort of live in and
Was there a lot of encouragement given to people to move out  premises?
"Oh yes, at that time there was, yes."
Oh yes.
If they accepted it of course.
"Was it er easy finding a job at that time as well, in the, in the new towns?"
Oh yes.
"It was being that the, the Rolls Royce  Saturday, came in to East Kilbride and, and American firms like that were coming along."
Singer sewing machines and sort of things like that.
"They were all coming into East Kilbride, there was b cos after all there was starting off a new town and they was building up then from it."
What were the erm conditions like in the creamery where you worked?
"You could substitute it, perhaps for that one."
"Yeah, okay, okay well look,"
Have a think about it
"yeah, okay."
"if, if you want to do a version of it first, I think we, we, we'll appreciate it very much."
"Okay, fine, okay yes."
"in order to get, because I hesitate to give you more work to do, you got enough work."
fine.
"But, think about it, it could be interesting."
"Yeah, okay, sure, fine."
We'll have words about it.
Thank you.
come on in.
"Now, I have some good news for you, and you could do with some good news, couldn't you?"
Yes.
"Least, I hope it's good news, from what you said last night, I think it would be good news."
"I have got you a computer, one of these  would you like one of those?"
I'd love one of those.
"Right, we can get you one."
I'll tell you what's happened.
"The thing is, the school has just launched a, a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students, okay?"
"Now, we've got one in this department, like this, and er, one of our graduate students was very interested in it, and since she was just finishing her P H D   the in some of the ways, some of the most erm, outspoken erm, persons for this, but I'm certainly not alone."
"There's a growing body now, of people who are thinking along similar lines, and er, so it's, it, it's, I think you'd be unwise to wipe this off just, just as my eccen eccentricity."
"I mean, it may be that."
"Look, we're gonna have to stop."
"we can carry on with this next week, as, as you see, we've touched on a big topic, so we'll, we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion, whatever way you think fit, erm, that raises other issues which you want to talk about."
Okay.
Thanks very much.
And well done  that was an excellent
a little contradictory.
"Erm, I read another erm, book on believing this."
"Yeah, fine."
But you can't back out of the whole rehearsal
"I mean I've backed out of going, having, I'm supposed to be working on that on the stalls as well but I backed out of that and said I've got a hair cut, erm, so I'll have to be done last."
"It's not, it's not gonna go on very long is it?"
"Yes, er probably until about half four"
"Well that's alright, she ain't she's not here till half three in any case"
"Yeah, you'll have to come home a bit er, a bit er"
Yes I know
She's  so this'll probably be our last appointment here wouldn't it?
"No I was saying to her  I'd probably have one more before I go anyway and er  I'm, I'm gonna ask her if she  with my, cos at that nana's there, I mean there'll be four of us there, it might be worth an hour and a quarter drive"
What her?
She wouldn't wanna drive an hour and a quarter
"Well she might not, she might do"
"She wouldn't drive an hour and a quarter, it's not worth it"
"Well we haven't much choice, we'll have to arrange something else that's all, mm I don't, I don't wanna give her up, she's a good hairdresser"
Well you can hardly ask her to drive round and er an hour and a half
An hour and a quarter
for twenty quid
"It's not twenty quid, if Melanie and I have our hair permed, that's, that's two perms and two, two cuts"
And granny have it done
Possibly
dad can have it done
Possibly
nice family outing
Er if she was to come over
Saturday
"No, no, no"
she won't do that
"but she could, I dunno perhaps we can work something out, I dunno, er failing that we'd have to come out to her house"
"Oh right, yeah, I'd rather go up the road, stupid"
"I know, but she's really good though, I be shall sorry to erm, have to give her up"
"oh dear, see that tutor tomorrow morning for an hour, hey hey"
"What, get the job er copied up then"
You've got six month's free membership don't worry about it.
Yeah I wasn't worrying about the six month's free membership.
But it does put in rather six months out of phase with the local membership so at least
Well John sorted that he's brought you up to date now.
Mm.
Because you know it's the same thing.
I was gonna give the er local party er  it'll be sixteen months  worth local membership
If you want to give us a donation that's entirely welcome.
Perfectly acceptable.
I'll buy some .
I've already bought some
yeah.
bought some  more er
So what Joe wanted the meeting to decide is should we ask Mark to send off a cheque for those three people?
I think that's the only way to proceed to to sort out this tangle once and for all.
Yeah.
You see apart from anything else if those people  joined through us then we we must make good .
And we fixed it.
The system's fixed so.
Yeah.
It it has to be fixed by either us or the national party.
We can't ask those people for money if they've already joined once.
Okay.
Erm I'll get Mark to send a cheque off when he gets back from .
Okay is that oh I suppose as as another officer I can er tell you that the the newsletter has indeed been finished and gone out.
Erm I would like to apologize on behalf of myself and my  proof reading team for the fact that two calls for nominations that erm that are in this newsletter don't actually appear to have closing dates on them.
Oh god.
Which is a bit of a stupendous cock-up from us
"At least on my part I'm, if I had my engineer's hat on I'd er blame the proof reading team as well."
But er I suppose really I er
Well you forgot to read it because you threw coffee over me.
I suppose the blame is at least almost entirely mine.
"Oh, brilliant."
So there should be something in there.
"I found something from the AIDS one the new Benetton advert, have you seen that?"
No.
Is it really sick?
Mm.
"Not really, it's a bit rude, I suppose."
"It's of erm,photo coloured photograph of, it's either a bloke or a woman, you can't tell, from there to about there, so you can see all the hair and everything it's got  on the skin H I V positive."
"Oh, I think I have seen it."
"Ah, that's terrible."
"They're just out to shock, aren't they?"
"Yeah, I think it's a good way, and, cos it makes people go, bloody hell."
"And then they take note of what the issue is, yeah."
"realize, don't they, yeah."
"So I've got all ready, for me AIDS  cos I used to just think oh I don't really, I could just go and get some leaflets on ban on"
True.
"Well, I must ad I'll probably end up going down there, and getting the"
Our local chemist at home.
"Yeah, they've, they've always got this good stand, haven't they?"
"All this stuff, loads of stuff down there about pregnancy, and measles."
"Yeah, so they reckoned it's not a scrapbook, but it is really."
"That's quite easy really, I'm quite happy doing that."
Quite like that idea.
"But erm, yeah, it's alright."
"I like this girl, cos she's Welsh, just, I can't do her accent, but she kept saying it several times, he was getting really pissed off with her."
He'd obviously taken time over building up this little booklet explaining the stuff.
She just destroyed it in one go.
Really?
"Like he, he was like saying, it's got to be a  the word book, will eventually  he was really getting into it and really going into about, you know, how it's really gonna be jam- packed with important information, and she just said,so it's just like a scrapbook really  you know, when if you've filled all that up"
Yeah.
and somebody said that.
"It's like, oh yeah, thanks."
"Yes, well course I."
The scenery and photography and everything suppose to be absolutely wonderful.
Yes that's worth it .
.
A lot of our modern hol
Hello Max.
"Modern   Come on, no she hasn't got anything for you,."
"Come on, come on, come on."
"You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say  come and try the mo modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments."
.
"Most of it comes  think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that"
Mm.
"and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks."
"That's right, there's certainly a ."
"That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic  and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?,"
I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally  birch bark.
"Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain"
"Oh yeah,."
"amputations, child birth  gosh the leaves are thick."
"Mm, they're lovely aren't they?"
When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones
Yes.
they remind me of when I was at school.
"Sycamore oh, sycamore and  ."
"used to get told to go out in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves ."
Actually I
"Could always , could always see if  biggest, biggest leaves like these you know,."
"That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour  These are  Dances with Wolves."
"Oh, it's  in shop."
If it's
.
"If it's good, erm, can I say truthful background of the Indians ."
General essays can turn into just regurgitating from the .
Okay so is there anything you've read that you all would want to concentrate on?
Erm Well not that I've come across yet  I'd rather do something that's  getting the facts and then giving examples.
Mhm.
I want top do something on what what you noticed about  and what you've got
Right.
Right.
Er let me think.
"I'll just go and find out when the due date for this essay is, and then Cos if it is the end of week three then I'll I'll say o I'll say it can be in in week four sometime."
"But if it's due in when the project originally was which was week five, then that"
"gives you a bit more time to decide exactly what you want to talk about cos if  if it has go to be in week three or week four, then we really sort of like decide now what you're going to write about so that n Cos next week is gonna be our last meeting on this topic, so you really want to sort of give a bit of a presentation on what you're going to say."
Yeah I want everyone to do like five or ten minutes next week on what they're gonna write.
Okay I 'll just go and find out.
What are they supposed to be doing by the way?
What happens to the like project?
It got cancelled .
Cancelled
It got cancelled?
"Oh right, didn't hear that then."
"There  Oh that's why we're not doing it any more, so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay ?"
Just an essay.
"Oh, they decided not to give us quite so much work?"
Mm.
Oh right.
So we Is that why the
"Is that what we're meant to be doing this term,tutorials?"
Think so I don't
When do our tutorials stop?
I'm really confused.
We've got two more tutorials?
"What Oh yeah, week three and week four, and"
Yeah.
Very good.
"We got our free milk, of course, we got our free milk."
"That was one  we got our free milk  as many pints of milk as we required for to keep our fam but no more, no more than that, just  much your family had they'd allow you a pint per  per person."
Was it erm was it hard work in the in the creamery?
Oh no.
No not in comparison to the jobs I'd already been in.
Oh no this was much easier for me.
Because   at that time .
And er after this did you move back to Edinburgh?
"I moved back to Edinburgh too because er my er my family had taken a yearning for Edinburgh, they didn't like East Kilbride so I says  left."
"And also it's true today, you go where your family wants to go and that was, this was er they had a yearning for that and they were not settling down so"
What did you do when you when you moved back to Edinburgh?
"Well I went into a timber yard er known as er, what was the timber yard again now?"
.
And they .
Where as I said  er working with timber.
Was that erm like sawmill or something?
"Sawmills, sawmills and ."
Cabinet makers
Was that a dangerous job?
"Well it could be dangerous, if you didn't watch what you were doing."
"Like every other, other job you've got to er gain experience as you go along, you've got to experience."
"And you've always got to, you've always g advice and on how to handle it before you, you put  actually handling them."
Were there erm any accidents or anything?
"Er but if there was any accidents through negligence, if there were accidents, it was negligence er and the people by themselves."
"Which is er worker often, often  often most of our accidents is caused by negligence."
So what were the conditions in the er in the mill like?
"Very good, very good conditions."
"Very good conditions indeed, aye."
Was there a union there as well?
Er there w wasn't a union then.
Mm.
Alright.
May we go sir?
"Yes, you can leave the court now."
Thank you.
Back to case thirty one.
Miss  apparently you represent Mr   er well I  I notice from the documents with the er  summons it was adjourned  because erm  their solicitor wrote to say that he will be claiming not guilty?
Oh yes.
Is that the case?
"Yeah, your worships I understand that the  the prosecution are  are making application   I don't that you should go on with this."
So is it ?
If if it's not going to trial
When they were
we'll do it now we'll take it now.
"I wonder if I can insist, it isn't a matter where  and they have spoken to me about this  particular case  and"
Go to forty five your worship.
"Sorry, I forgot the"
"The view of the prosecution that this is matter  could be dealt with  quite satisfactorily by the way of  in the court  were minded to do that, if the court would accept that course of action."
I understand that Mr  would be  willing to be bound over.
Does that compare with that ?
Well obviously Miss  the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds  why they should bind him over  they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future  otherwise they will not bind him over.
"I appreciate that sir, but you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear  conducts from the case and if he is still present obviously  whatever the court wishes to do."
"I see, well in that case then I will leave it alone, I'll deal with this a little bit later on, obviously  it could take"
As you want.
possibly .
Who else is present Mrs ?
"Er  number forty one sir,."
Do deal with that your worships  please?
Forty one .
Are you Sylvia ?
Yes.
What is your date of birth please?
Ha?
"curiously enough, they seem to have I mean I I have"
"Yeah, but they have only to do with things like national security and and"
"Yes but er I I think that erm er the little by little, the conventions have been stretched."
And of course there's huge
do you think they should be tightened up again?
There's huge money.
Dramatic money.
You know.
"And and and and have no illusions, the money and the contents are very linked."
"That it's no use going round saying, Well here's my view of history as I wrote it."
"Er and it's factual it's it's analytical, it's it's erm devoid of the sort of bitchiness of politics."
Cos you won't get enough money.
You mean people spice them up
"Oh yeah, sure sure."
You think Mrs Thatcher's done that?
I have no idea.
I wouldn't dream of making such an observation.
But it sounds as though you suspect that.
I I'm not going to be drawn even by your deft questioning
Alright but the rules
in this direction.
But the rules ought to be changed.
There ough the rules ought to be hardened up to stop this kind of thing going on
I I I I I doubt if you could have rules.
I doubt any more whether we live in the sort of society where you could have such rules.
"Since we're talking about rules, what about erm Mrs Thatcher, Lady Thatcher wanting to change the rules so that a sitting Prime Minister can't be challenged."
Oh no certainly not.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
"I w I I personally er made it clear at the time when they changed the rules er er fairly recently, that I didn't think they should."
"Erm I think that er erm politicians understand full well the nature of the profession in which they're involved and the parliamentary party is erm more than able to exercise a proper judgement, er I don't think there's any case at all for er changing th I don't think there was a case for changing the rules and I don't think there is a case for changing the rules today."
So you're out of step with people like Douglas Hurd and Norman Fowler?
"Yes, it says"
It says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're no you're not reducing the size of the bus
well I think that's crazy
"And someone who's been u just used to driving a car, are they going to be able to drive a huge long bus with no extra tuition?"
Well
"Whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine, it doesn't alter the length of the bus"
"Well, I drive the mini bus at the hospital"
I know
Which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there's the drivers of the minibus thing at .
I think I I would query that anyway
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
"No, no but"
and just drive it
"But but I query as well whether, just because you reduce the number of passengers in it, that you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent, it isn't a P S V licence but it's it's"
have looked into that
"It sounds doubtful to me, but anyway, there's the insurance point of view, but anyway  if people whoa re willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out."
Y'know I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
Y'know I I drove the minibus with only somebody in with me before I drove it with people in it
Did you drive
"Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that"
"Yeah, but, you drove that one"
I drove it to Ashington and back
You drove  to Ashington in it.
Erm do you think I could throw these roses out?
"They're dead, aren't they?"
I'm afraid so
It's a shame
Pardon?
"They'll they'll have been forced from last Sunday, that was the  wasn't it?"
"I know, I know but they were dead by about Tuesday."
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
"I I wrote to Atkins saying as Minister for the Environment er, Please support the energy conversation bill because it's dead good."
Presumably I can also write to John Gummer saying  is dead good.
Am I right to write to the others saying I or should
Oh yeah.
"I write to Gerry  saying say, Please prod Robert Atkins and remind him that the energy conservation bill's dead good in case he's forgotten."
Erm no I think the former I think the Parliamentary
But I can write to him in his capacity as Robert Atkins' Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Yes.
Cos otherwise it looks like writing to random M Ps.
I think you're sort of drawing drawing their attention to the public concern over that sort of phrase.
And widespread  cross party support.
Yes.
Honest guv.
wishy-washy statements for your audience.
I presume getting letters out is more important than high quality prose here is it?
Oh yes.
Just a couple
Cos I mean
of lines will do.
name name dropping the supporters I mean for to those Tories telling them that the that the association for county councils for example is a backer probably counts more than telling them that that   is a backer .
Yeah well I think particularly
or green particularly
doing their own I just take the letters I've already written to other people change one sentence and change the er name on
That's fine so
comrade.
Printed off on my er employer's er computer and er put it in one of their envelopes and try to steal a stamp from them.
We're gonna get it all down Andy don't worry.
How wide is the Green Party's main bill associated with  do you think?
Well in the main lobbyist has been Ron  who's the who's our elected campaigns officers and he's quite literally been spending time treading the the hallowed halls of Westminster
I mean in the media.
In the media I mean I haven't seen much about it in the media.
Er
"I'm no longer, yes."
"The next, the next question is is jealousy another powerful promoter of family black sheep."
I'm not quite sure what that means.
Is is is is jealousy another power promoter of family black sheep.
"It is jealousy that pushes people into being  black sheep, into er doing something which is not acceptable."
"Yes, I think it can  part of it."
Mm.
Mm.
"You know one sees, rightly or wrongly, that the other one is having preferential treatment."
"Yeah, yeah."
And getting attention seeking.
"It could well have been the jealousy of the older brother, what caused him to be thought of as a black sheep."
"Black sheep, yes, yeah  So jealousy is quite powerful, could could be the driving force, between sons, yes."
sons.
In those days when there's land expected.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"This, by the way, erm, it it is applied with this study, and that is during the thirties, particularly on the, well it it actually carried on into the forties, but but the, there was a almost a  character in many plays, where one one character was, in effect, the family black sheep."
"Erm, there was  in Eden End, erm, there was another character in erm,there was a further one in"
"Oh, yes."
Yeah.
"Now, all these were black sheep, they were the nicest of the lot, and there was no, they were the ones you turned to, if you wanted to discuss your troubles."
"Not the other respectable brigade, and indeed in Eden End, the whole play turns on the jealousy of the sister, who remained at home."
Mm.
"The the family black sheep, the other sister went, er, er, left home to go on the stage."
"But of course, when she came back, all sorts of things began to happen, that's by the way."
"One other little point, in Brideshead Revisited, there's a character who never appears, she's always spoken about, and thwarted and that is  the man who Brideshead marries, and she says, talking to Julia, Julie was no better than she should have been."
"You know, she says, in every Catholic family, er, there is always a relapse person, and it's usually the nicest."
Aw.
Mm.
So even Evelyn Waugh's  told this story.
"Yes,"
"Yes, yes, yeah."
"Erm, we're looking at all other things being equal."
"Let's assume that all the offspring are the same, in quality."
"Even, let's even make them all the age."
"Let's say they're all the same in quality, they're all the same in age."
There's still a difference as far as the parents are concerned.
Can anybody see what it is?
"Well, alright, I mean."
Let's deal with the first bit first.
Why should they treat them all equally?
"Why, why does the parent regard its offspring equally?"
In what sense?
Why?
This is the important one.
"From the parents' point of view, it is equally related to all its offspring."
"Now this is, this is the counter-intuitive bit."
Supposing I'm a parent.
"In fact,let let's do this in terms of a little diagram."
Let's put this on the board.
I'll do this in the lecture.
But let's just do it.
"It's easier if you do it on the board, and you can see it."
"Let's, supposing that I am the parent."
Okay.
I'm the parent P.
"Here am I, parent P, okay."
"I have two offspring, A and B which are smaller, little er A and B  offspring A and offspring B, and they are exactly equal in eve every point of view, size, quality and animal  okay."
"Now, erm, supposing that er, I have ten units of parental investment, and I invest ten in A and ten in B because I'm equally related to both of them."
Okay.
"Now, supposing that I want A to do something for B, like in  's case,A to give up a food item for B. Okay."
"Now as far as I'm concerned, if the benefit to B is greater, supposing for example, they're not the same age, sorry, I shouldn't have said that about being the same age."
"Er, supposing they're not the same age."
"But supposing I invested equal amounts of parental investment in both and supposing that if offspring A gives two units of parental investment to offspring B, the benefit to B's reproductive success will be three minutes, which it could be, if B was younger."
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got
Hold on.
Wha how  where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.
"There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals."
"And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a proggie mat exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat
Well
exhibition?
"well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it."
And various other art things.
"But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden  up."
"But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital."
"But then I thought, perhaps  if  that"
I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here
Well they won't
to go Ashington Hospital to do a
"they won't so the they, they"
garden.
"the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all"
No.
to pay for that.
I would expect
But then
that's a very low priority.
"well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing."
They won't get the money.
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming.
"But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see."
Mr
Yes.
"Obviously there are a number of detailed points and these are just the ones that are coming off the top of this meeting and you will have more when you take them home and, and read them."
"Most of the schemes that are put in here are actually assessed by the area highway engineer and if you've got particular schemes, especially ones that you know you've talked about in the past, the best way of dealing with them is to speak to him directly and say, why isn't it in this time?"
If you're not happy with the answer then I'd be pleased to hear about it and er and er obviously we can assess the priority .
"Erm, on  there's a specific question I'd like to ask er  if he could throw some light on that one."
"Yes, if I can mention that the  is on the  and it's really associated with the government's intention to raise the er limit of lorries to forty tons by nineteen ninety nine."
Now what we have done is looked at s these causeway relief arches which  pass the water from one side of the  to the other at .
We've looked at those and the v they have very seriously deteriorated.
"The concrete's spalling, the reinforcement is being attacked and we've looked at various ways in which they can be repaired or replaced."
"To replace them, for example, would cost something over a million pounds, but this is actually a repair to those er culverts  the ."
"Right, thank you Mr ."
"Right, can I take you to the recommendation on page nine that the programme be circulated to all members of the committee."
Erm
Quickly then
I  would be the case
No er
He's got a beard.
Oh dear
Ken
On erm
Ken  yeah that's it.
Bruce?
"Bruce, yeah."
That's it.
Yeah.
I like him.
Oh I used to listen to that for ages.
Mm.
I like him I do.
"He, he has some lovely records."
"Good, good choice, you know?"
"I believe there is so now, but there wasn't then."
"So it, it didn't really matter to me."
I've always still held my card.
Although I still held my card of the Transport and General Workers.
Mhm.
So you continue to be a member of the Transport and General
"Oh aye, yes, oh ."
Oh yes.
"God I  you could never tell if you're, you're going to be there long enough in job, if the, the boss didn't like you then he would just say well you're, you're paid off and that's it, so that's sort of benefit of keeping your union membership up you could go to anywhere where there was a trade union, a union membership and get a job."
"So er the, was being unemployed at that time quite precarious?"
If there was
"It was, it was."
"At that time, yes."
"It was er at that time because of the, they were very few and far between."
Employment was very few and far between.
"Because there wasn't the same amount of work,this is just after the war I'm talking about, and there wasn't so many  going then."
There were only starting making themselves then.
Er
"So were erm were jobs quite hard to come by in those days, after the war?"
Well er well it all depended on the individual themselves.
If there's a miner who's  in getting work.
Although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after.
Depending on the rate of wages.
Depending on the rate of wages.
"So you're actually, if you're going for a job, you want er for the highest place where you get the highest wages, which was a   for any working, you're going to"
What did you do after you left the erm after you left the timber mill?
"After the timber mill, er ."
Now can I remember about after the timber mill?
Let's see now.
My mind's a blank  I've been in that many different jobs now.
"I thought you said you were in a, a warehouse after that wasn't"
Oh that's right.
How you going to know exactly where the boundaries go or i in between some land-lock countries  that you got it in the right position
How many land-lock countries are there in South America?
"Well enough anyway, I mean I thought you were giving me something easier to do not"
Well I think  why would you do it tonight if I didn't have it?
Yes
Say I didn't have it tomorrow you'd
well
do it tonight?
probably ni or tomorrow I was gonna do that.
"I seem to think you should take the easy bit, cos that's gonna be miles too hard!"
"No I like to balance it, I ju there's some balance there, there's some easy ones and some hard ones."
I'll tell you what's best for Michael.
I don't feel that's very good  because you're just gonna get children totally pull out of it unless they're
No.
really really good.
Children are allowed to go
"You find that if if if i in a team, if there's teams  i you find that in a singles, but if there's a team e if everybody feels the everybody feels they can contribute something to it  when you've got"
You can have those
"allowed to be the idea of that, you don't wanna make it"
Yeah I know
too easy
No there are no husbands allowed to be with any wife  and children can attach themselves to which group they want.
"So work out the groups, you work out the groups."
Well there's going to be  apart from your father there's going to be seven adults.
"Listen, a man with a woman  but not wi not  by marriage  cos say like Andy with Nanna"
"Well I could go with two children, I expect."
"Well write down the names let's have a go at, let's work out, let's work out the teams"
"Cos I'm the cleverest person, I can go with two teenies!"
"lo , write down the names."
Modest!
No and I could be the only adult with two children cos I'm so clever.
Write down the names and th work out some balanced teams then for me please.
"So they went up there and did that, and then, I ca they've done quite a lot and then they're going up London tomorrow, I think."
So I don't see much of her.
So you think they'll probably stay up there next weekend?
Don't know.
"I'll see, I might, might go out tomorrow instead of Sunday."
"I don't know yet, I don't know ."
"What's happening about your car, is Craig going to take it back with him?"
"Well, I suppose he might as well, I mean, if you're off work, he might as well have it, mightn't he?"
"Yeah, that's true."
Mm.
"Unless I feel like being really vindictive,"
"saying, I want the car."
No.
I don't need it.
"I could have done with it, I couldn't get on the bloo they got this internal bus service that runs from each college, cos you have to go to the other colleges for your lectures, and I just sort, there's not enough, and you, you get turned away, and I just thought, I went for that bus Tuesday morning, I was supposed to get it at eight fifteen, and he just said sorry,no more room ."
"Oh no, so what happens then?"
"So, security guard came over, and if you go up to the next stop,bus, you could come in with them."
"So we got on that bus, and he didn't like it, this bus driver,oh, you're not supposed to be on here"
"What, because you hadn't parked your cars there first?"
"Yeah, but the thing is, we're not from  college, so that means their students are gonna be, like, pushed out."
Yeah.
"So anyway, we got on, and he"
"Well, that's their problem, they should get more bloody buses."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, the thing was, because it left about fifteen minutes later, at a quarter past eight, there was so much difference in traffic,"
Mm.
"half eight, getting on quarter to nine, it was jam-packed and I didn't get into the college."
It's a ten minute bus ride.
I didn't get into that college until gone half nine.
"Oh, really?"
To my lecture.
"Yeah, I didn't walk in till half nine."
The lecture starts at nine.
.
"Yes, I I think, in cer in in most cases that would happen, wouldn't it, if if if the child starts off with a feeling of insecurity, with possible instability."
Mm.
Then a powerful father is going to make the situation  worse.
Because him being the only son.
Mm.
"He was probably spoilt by his sisters, and and got more or less what he wanted as a child, and"
As a child.
"Carried on  you know, what I want, I get."
Mm.
in adulthood.
"What is this, thirty, thirty, how old was he, thirty-one when he died."
Thirty-one.
"Oh, yes."
"Thirty-one very very young age, for someone, apparently so so talented to die."
Think there were drugs as well as the drink.
"Oh well, that"
"Yes, yes, yes, yeah."
"Not mentioned there, but doubtless."
"That is, that is true."
"Okay, the next thing, erm, accurate or not, Trevor and I have already sa erm, talked about this, erm, many an Adult School members will remember the enthusiasm and popularity that surrounded the future Edward the eighth, when he was Prince of Wales."
"Prince of Wales it is suggested erm, was a black sheep of the family."
"Here it was thought, was a man who understood the people and  for them."
"Someone with a genuine concern for the wounded of World War One, the miners of South Wales, the unemployed, for, and homeless in general."
"In slightly less than a year, citizens high expectations had been shattered and it was all over."
"As John Parker put it, in the King of Fools, he had it all, wealth, charm, good looks, and he threw it all away on an American divorcee, who even his closest advisers considered an adventuress."
On the folly of his Nazis connections.
"On the absurdity of his get rich quick schemes, which involved him with shady financiers."
Why?
"This much travelled man, with all of his promise was at best, a controversial figure, and at worst a family black sheep."
"He could have said with Hamlet, The Time is Out of Joint, and Cursed Spit that Ever I was Born to Set it Right."
"Edward, known as David to his family, did not want the role of Kingship, but then, neither did his brother Bertie."
We didn't come into it
"Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details."
Well this was erm Bulgaria
"Yes, yes"
Mm
"but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in."
I certainly wouldn't coach it  so  I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you?
"Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to  to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time"
Yeah
"cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean  I'm not particularly bothered whether"
"comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his"
"Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him"
"Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he?"
"But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility"
"Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?"
Italy
Did they?
Yes Florentine
or near Venice
That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there
Yes
"that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to"
What they got
"afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage"
Yes that's a point
"so, you know"
"that's a point, yeah"
so unless erm
even if we
tell us we
went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we?
What does against animal testing mean?
These are the kind of things that are actually on cosmetic products.
Mm.
"It could mean, erm, against animal testing but I go along with it anyway."
"It could mean erm  cruelty free, er erm who de defines in that case, what cruelty is?"
"Er, not, not tested on animals might mean, by me  by but by someone else!"
And it all sells products!
"And, beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er, trying to put forward an E C  erm, directive on th er, the labelling of cosmetics, but it's very, very difficult!"
"And, mainly because of those kind of problems."
Yeah.
Yep.
"What do you mean by  erm, not tested on animals?"
The finished product?
The ingredient?
Ingredients are tested for other reasons too  not necessarily just for the cosmetic and toiletry trade.
"I think that one of the outstanding erm  criticisms that I would make  of the whole programme, in research with animals, is the fact that only two licences have been revoked I think you said"
Mhm.
"on  now, I think it's a bit like factory inspectors, and I talk from experience on this, er  th o i me , everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors"
Mhm.
arrive!
"If you report something you always get the same reply, nothing wrong when we went round!"
Mm.
"I'd like to move with th er, I I think tha wi given wi , though we haven't got all that much time, can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm  the use of animals in recreation and er  Lisa particularly mentioned hunting, now, she thinks hunting should be banned, do you?"
Do you think hunting animals should be banned?
"Various animals that  hunted in this country, foxes, in some places deer, hares are coursed er in some places."
Well well!
There's an interesting result!
"Seventy nine of you think yes, hunting should be banned."
"For the minority, twenty one say, no."
Would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no?
Yes?
"Well I I so , should er  be unhappy to see the, the the red-coated huntsmen  a an abolished scenario."
as the dances are concerned.
And another thing is the young ones don't dance.
They can
Do you mean by young ones my generation ?
"I mean , yes, well maybe you can but I do but the the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like Carl and them, they can disco but they they can't waltz or  er foxtrot or"
How did you learn to waltz then?
"Just by going to dances, just by going to dances, we just, you just picked it up, your your partner could do it and you just learnt from there."
Mhm.
That's one thing I've always been a quick learner which has been quite
Mhm.
I think Jane's got  er that as well.
She seem to be able to pick thing sup.
Does she like dancing?
Not as fa not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up.
Mhm.
"It was the same in the the pantomimes when Lily has learnt learnt the dancing, I could er after she had showed us about twice I could I could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps."
So it's quite an advantage.
So did you go to dances quite a lot before you were married  ?
Oh yes in  aye.
Was that the place where everybody went to
To the Town Hall.
young lads and lasses would get together ?
"Lasses would yes, aye, to the dances."
"And they used to run  er buses to different places, you know, you used to go to different places, and ."
And what kind of band played for the dances when you were in  then?
"Bands like what Tommy has, you know accordion bands."
That er they were all more or less that kind of band.
So by the time you came here it would mostly just be Tommy that was playing?
"Roundabouts, er the only one I can remember is Tommy round about, you know playing er in the Hall."
"And , it was just these kind of bands that"
Mhm.
"were in those days, the accordion bands."
"Thanks, bye bye."
You can stay of course!
Don't blame you!
Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business.
Do you all have sight of that?
"It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para."
"2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you."
Are you agreed?
Agreed.
So that we can get on with this work.
Thank you very much indeed.
On to item six and seven.
You'll remember we do this on an annual basis.
It's very efficiently organised for us to do.
"We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers."
"Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford."
"Thanks, Chair."
"Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair."
"This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,"
She does?
She's one of the members you can come to.
So Katherine can answer the details on the report.
Right.
"Welcome, Katherine."
I didn't realize that's who you are.
I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes!
"So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage?"
"I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford."
Right
That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention.
"So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag."
"Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford."
"Shall we have just a quick Lisa and Dean want to tell us what's going, cos they've had you, had the first meeting now, haven't you?"
Do you want to tell us what interest there was.
"I, I was about to ask the same thing, yeah ."
"Are you going to,interest  ."
"Well I called a meeting but I didn't think I advertised it well enough because there was a lot of interest and then I think we held it at the wrong time as well didn't we,"
Mm.
"we held it after prep, so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm  and lot more people express interest because of that, we haven't actually got any letters yet."
"No, that's  so when we leave there should be more interest."
"Mm, mm, good, good."
"And I'm intending to, to hold a few more assemblies as well to sort of get interest going again because it's been a while since we did an assembly on it, so if we do another one, that usually gets it going again doesn't it?"
"What you run assembly's with on, particular topic then."
"Yeah , well we'll take erm Michael  gave us say erm a, an assembly sheet didn't he and we just read from that, and that got a lot of interest from that."
Yeah
"Mm, good"
How many teams were suppose to meet  out of that?
It was about twelve people.
How many is that?
.
There were a lot more people than that.
That was last week.
"I was gonna say, there were a lot more people when we went to school."
"There are a lot more people than that, there, I only put one advert ."
"Well that's, that's, lot more people who are interested ."
Right.
"Even so, that tell us ."
"Ah right, well yeah, I suppose"
Advertise in Stortford
Twelve is a working number.
"Oh well I hope, I hope it goes right tomorrow."
Yes.
"Yes, good, good, just keep in touch with us and know how things are going."
Yeah.
What you you say the shock of it.
What what was it like?
All of those of us who haven't had a heart attack live in fear of it obviously and think
"Yeah well, I mean we all My father died of a heart attack."
Mm.
And erm er that was a long time ago.
I si think it's very possible that he wouldn't have erm died under today's
Today.
conditions.
I had wonderful treatment in Italy.
I was very close to a a hospital with a wonderful cardiac er unit er where they had a professor who was one of the leading Italian in the subject.
"I was there within an hour, so I couldn't be more grateful and appreciative."
"They're wonderful people, the Italians."
"Er anyway that the the but the actual experience, er one knew something was wrong."
"I was not frightened, I didn't think anything was that wrong."
"But I said to Anne, Look I think you better get a doctor."
This was before it happened or when it happened? you didn't have sort of intimations that something was going to happen ?
"Well I I you see, it's all hindsight."
"I think in truth erm er we'd taken a weekend off and er to go to Venice, there was a big er art exhibition on and Anne wanted to see that."
"Erm and I I wasn't feeling on top form and er looking back, I perhaps should have gone to a doctor then."
But you don't you know.
"Erm but th anyway, there it was and er I had this pain Not not acute, that's why I wasn't that worried."
it didn't last that long.
Erm and from that moment I got into hospital and I had no more trouble.
But I mean of course they plugged me up with all sorts of things.
Wi with of course one disastrous consequence.
"Which er I mean, damn the British media like all politicians do."
One of the things they have to do is to get your uric acid I think it's called erm content correct.
And it it so they give you some m medicine for that.
A side effect of which can be that you can develop gout.
And so the what what what that
"Ah, that explains"
"But, erm  I think they could instead have  an electric fox, if there's such a thing?"
"Or, a drag  and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all."
Okay.
Yes?
"They say that hunting's for er  er human pleasure, er, I mean personally I've only been to one hunt, and I don't see what all the  the, the, the, the trouble's about because the huntsman is only a spectator, it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down."
"What's better than , gassing, shooting, poisoning?"
Mm.
What's more humane?
So you think hunting's fair enough?
"From my point of view, yeah."
Yes?
Beside you.
"Yes, I I would have to, I'd have to disagree with er, my colleague here."
"Erm, I, it's not the  shooting is, most certainly, as long as it's with a  a qualified marksman"
Mm.
it's most
Mhm.
"definitely less cruel than hunting  because the animal is chased and er, what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's, really is  the idea's quite horrendous to me!"
"And actually, hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes, a a hunt probably erm, kills one an, at a meet  if they're lucky."
"But hunting does maintain jobs, and countryside people often say."
Would anyone like
Mm.
"to talk to, to to that?"
Yes?
Well coming from a rural community
erm  hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the
Yeah.
"economy of the community  and to have suburbia creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been  the foundation of the  of their economy, for many, many years is  almost ridiculous!"
Mhm.
Down there.
I think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart legitimized by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children!
"When children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society, and they see us as one world  we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world, and that includes the animals in it."
he meant to hit the car that was going
I know
so silly in he?
"he hit the back window and then he didn't do nothing, but then it all shattered"
"did the man go up the school?, he never did he?"
"he did and he thought I grassed, but I never, geezer want your window smashed"
yeah
"a red light come on the back and when, and then when the  and let them go, must of heard it, saw  running  and he's"
"er, he didn't have to pay did he?"
"no, he"
what happened about it then?
and then Andy got enough trouble that year cos he  as well didn't he?
"I know, he put all the paper up his arm"
that was
"how long these tapes for?, like the first seven"
"there, then, they're ninety minutes tape"
"no not first, not all of 'em is it?"
"yeah, they're T D K ninety they are"
"yeah, I don't think the other ones are"
is that ninety minutes each way?
"what?, no it's just, it might be forty five"
"and I'm gonna go like and Leyton Orient just scored the goal for this, that and the other  it's a big area, and everyone's going what commentator for  I said I'm not  I'm on the radio"
"yeah, that'll get nicked off ya"
no it won't
that will
"I will go  what I'll do tomorrow is  zip it in my inside pocket there and wire it  and all you can see, that's enough really  you don't have to ask"
who?
does he bunk off a lot Peter?
"no he don't bunk, he, he has got a lot of things, you know, he orders and that"
see you later
"Ah Ricky  did you see the state of our trainers?er ah Richard it's fucked up, just gonna go over there it's alright Ricky I'll do  Rick I can just tear this off, but I like the noise on the thing"
you never know
right okay what sort of.
Do you make presentations now?
meetings
yep so it's it's about meetings?
yep
"great, thanks, Tom"
"erm, my name's   from Edinburgh a couple of jobs  one which is  the sort of presentations I do tends to be one to one  the hardest one for me as I say meetings with quite a lot of people there"
right
"erm, I think I want to try and improve my presentation"
"right, so it's the actual presentation skills themselves"
that's right
and what we actually do when we're standing up so that it becomes more effective yeah?
Great.
my name's  I'm from Tarmac Construction Plant at  depot  I'm office manager and I'm also in charge of the stores hiring all the plant and equipment for all the sites in our area
right
I also  as many stores as possible
of course
erm I don't make presentations as such but erm I do have one to one discussions with on the sites on what plant they need and stores
"right, yep"
basically I hope to be more  effective in talking to  as I can
"right, so it's about persuasion isn't it?"
yeah
"right,Mike"
"I'm  I'm a site agent for Tarmac Construction at  erm I attend quite a few erm presentations really, tender interviews often going to the clients management meetings, site meetings and then like a lot of you the one to one situation."
sure
apart from most of those
right
erm I'd like to be able to present something in front of me which prompts me a bit better than I do at the moment I tend to get lost in what's in front of me.
"right, right so that's that's partly to do with you your preparation isn't it but it's if I put the word script"
yeah
we'll I know what we mean yep  how do you prepare what what you physically have in front of you so that you're able to put the point over effectively
"yeah right yep great, Dave"
"What a shame, never mind."
"Right, I'll put my make up on"
Can you tell me where you want this umbrella tree?
Er
it needs a saucer of course
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one
Oh but that's in
Well
plant pot  altogether
"Well, just leave it there for now."
"Erm, I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops"
It's ten o'clock
I know.
I'll have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner .
Oh my head feels .
I do I haven't had a headache like this for
I wanted a carton of live yoghurt.
"I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start it was fruit flavoured, no it wasn't it was natural, but it said mild flavoured and I don't think it was the proper like the Greek style really live yoghurt that would have started all the fungus growing on it."
It is beginning to look like a proper .
"Er, ok, I'll go and get ready"
I don't think it matters but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I've got it standing on that brick to drain.
Wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the erm stems on it look as if as if , not mouldy, but er they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put another one in
green
"Those hyacinths in the corner are taking a long time to come out, aren't they?"
"I'd have though the tulip  in the coal scuttle, the tulips in the cauldron, I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely"
"I know, but they've straightened out"
but they've grown up again.
And those forget me nots that're called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers are coming out with tiny pinky purple flowers.
"Thirty odd, thirty"
"That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around there."
"Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last year."
Makes more.
"It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments."
When you think of it.
I know.
"and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse."
Oi.
"I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know,it it's totally unfair,"
They are.
"I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it."
Yeah.
You know what I mean.
"Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're wouldn't be half and a quarter."
"I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries."
I know.
Communist countries.
"Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing."
Watch she don't bite ya.
"I mean, communism in England,"
"in it's  in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor."
I know.
"The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for al for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em."
No.
"So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo the the"
isn't it.
"poorer people, they stop 'em getting educated."
That I'm I'm almost convinced.
Yeah.
"It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you can't get educated"
"un cutting back,"
oooh
"And everyone's very welcome to come, I'll let you know"
reply to it
Eleventh of March
Well it's now come under a general invited round to us all
Yeah
"Eleventh of March, yeah"
"The  on the contacts slip so you can read at your leisure, anybody else want to raise any points, Tracy at all, David"
About car park
"Green vans, green vans"
green vans
Are we
I'm gonna tell it
don't start
"No, I've been and spoken to them again this morning and yesterday, R S C left it there not O S D although it's O S D's van, so they should've come out to move it on Friday and the mechanics didn't turn up, then they lost the keys, cos yesterday myself and who was it, Lyn, waited up for the keys cos they were gonna move down put it into a safer spot."
mm
Couldn't find the keys anywhere
Well they were hung up on the board in O S D on Friday when I went down there
Which which office?
In the a in the
"No, you know you know as you're going down the corridor before you get to the doors to go down the next set of stairs, I mean in O S D, the last one is er for the P C that does all the man er you know all the duties and things like that, and in his office there's a great big board with all the vehicles on, and the key's hung up at the end and who's got 'em out, and the bottom one is that green van, because he went up and picked 'em up, when I was there."
I was coming to David
tomorrow morning if it's still there
yeah
yeah
We're not gonna put any  down cos it's going somewhere else
But they're gonna have to find him
Erm Bob  Bob
No no no
You have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across across the transit van bays
So nobody can get in at all
"Mm, or their transits"
Right.
Because I've already written to Atkins cos that's in the newsletter.
Yeah.
So he's Secretary of State.
I'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we're here by definition.
And so we're likely to I think if I put the whole list in the newsletter it might have put people off.
Yeah.
Erm
Yes is it  all about this any more in the newsletter next newsletter?
No because I think by the end well unless something dramatic happens on the fourth of February which is this Friday next Friday rather.
If it does I'll be on to you straight on the phone.
But otherwise I I don't expect to need any more work on this for this Friday.
Yeah.
But we ought to have something about having a second reading in it anyway
Oh of course yes.
because it's news.
Yes indeed.
Even if it's stop press.
probably getting tight for Monday the seventh anyway.
Brilliant.
On a point of information Helen what can happen on on this second reading if
Right I can I I can tell you.
Erm there'll be a whole a whole day's debate on the bill which is an achievement in itself.
At the end of which a number of things can happen.
Firstly the bill can go through on the nod with no note.
This is possible with ballot laws  is now ballot bill.
But we can't rely on it.
It's quite possible that some MPs will try and talk the bill out.
That is try and ensure that when the House rises at two thirty P M the debate on the bill is still in progress.
And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate.
"Now this means that the sponsor of the bill, Allan ,brothers,pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading."
In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred MPs in the House to vote for the closure.
Well that's got the ball rolling.
Erm  and if anybody runs into anybody else and can ask them or anything if there isn't actually an army of er sort of letters coming through your door saying yes yes make me a candidate.
Just to remind everybody that we've decided that this year we weren't going to put pressure on people.
Because it just took so much of our energy last time helping people fill in forms and everything.
If people aren't comfortable enough to volunteer.
"I mean obviously if  for example didn't ring up and say I want to sign your name your name tomorrow, I'd ring her up to see whether she'd lost her  mind or something ."
Because you know she usually does.
She's actually got er terrible flu.
But I'm going round to see her next weekend.
Yeah but you know what I mean.
If it's somebody who we really expect to stand then by all means then chase them up.
But I don't want to go around looking for candidates like we did last time.
Because it's erm it just takes too much energy away.
Right.
And if we haven't got a full slate well I mean looking at that list we're doing quite well.
Yeah.
So would you be likely to speak to John  saying again wouldn't like to pressure Jean again but think John would like to
I'm sure John would.
Erm I shall ring him and ask him make sure he's
I'll try and ask  .
So have we taken a decision to target Bishopgate then?
Yeah.
It's five for the next five years.
It's quite a commitment.
So we're looking for the ideal candidate.
Yep.
This is before anybody gets any ideas at all.
And the the reasons for it is because we're it's the sort of by far the most solid concentration of our our actual members and likely supporters.
I used to live down there towards one part of that.
Yeah.
So it's all it's from that time on it's .
I'd like to get that back again if we could.
Yes but I remember right a .
So it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of.
When we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans.
Mm.
And my word there was plenty of vans in them days.
Both getting butcher meat.
What even in the thirties?
Yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the Nedd to Lochassynt when when  Lochassynt Lodge you see.
So these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to as well as them.
It's not like nowadays when people has big fridges
Mm.
buy their stuff away down south and take it.
But no they would buy it there aye .
So provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days.
There wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ?
No no there wasn't the same.
But only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er Hamiltons of Glasgow
Mm.
and it would be coming on the steamer McBrayne's steamer and
Up to Lochinver?
Yes to Lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in Kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for Hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er Ceylon coming from Ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter.
But oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk.
Mm.
But that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no peri
Mm.
Can you recall in those days Tommy how people kept perishables?
Well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground.
If there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones
Mm.
and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool.
Mm.
Even in the Summer?
"I can't do job, it's course work, don't you understand?"
Well
"How am I suppose to copy up course work, it's my own work"
"Do, do you study that at home then?"
What?
A science or something
"Mum it's a tutor period, it means work"
Oh you'll have to work then
don't sit around for an hour doing nothing
I realise that Richard
but don't be stupid
"Look, if you've got work to copy up, why can't you study and work in"
Because he's a tutor
What do you do in it?
I have D R N L As to do
"Mm, I used to let my  when it's tutor period, get on and do some revision work"
Good grief.
"and it's much nicer it, they know what they've got to look at."
"I've got to go and see Wally in tomorrow for the forms, I ain't got any forms to fill in cos I'm officially not leaving, I'm only moving"
"That's right, that's right"
change of address
I don't know it yet
"it will be change, I can't say, is it, I mean I said it's a change of address, they know I'll probably be moved in four to six weeks"
Do get that out of your mouth please
Which is it gonna be?
I'm not signing or changing anything Richard until we have exchanged contracts
"Oh yeah, that's easy muck around do what I do"
"No Richard because the whole thing can fall through  when we have our survey done it might show a defect or something, we might pull out, when they have their survey done it might show a defect so they might pull out, you don't do anything Richard until the contracts have been exchanged, then you can start saying right I think that's, that's, every thing's definite"
Alright  we were doing company law  and
"Mm, mm"
"I was damn good I knew everything, first I had to watch the accounts and secondly I'm looking at all this stuff for when I start my business"
"Mm, mm"
Any idea what gas might be being produced?
No I was trying to think  it's zinc.
And it's in a basin of hydrogen
Zinc and nitrate.
and it would give off  nitrate wouldn't it?
Zinc nitrate?
Which isn't a gas.
Which isn't a gas.
It's a salt.
So perhaps some odd hydrogen is produced as well.
Well that sometimes happens when there's
Two minutes?
Right.
Yeah I think the two minutes is up.
David's timed two minutes.
Now when that acid is  fresh and hasn't been used before  two minutes is usually quite enough for it to have done the  job it's supposed to do.
"This is an imprecise  operation because  since the acid has been used I don't know how many times  because the temperature, the ambient temperature in the room varies."
"In the winter when it's cold it works more slowly  now when it's very hot it will, should work more quickly."
Er I can't say precisely  leave it in the acid for so and so time.
"So we always  this has always been the case for the four  five hundred years that people have been doing etching, so they go by a rule of thumb."
"The rule of thumb is this  when the first cluster of bubbles is fully formed, sweep them away with a bird's wing feather."
So  I have duly swept them away.
Which means that the acid can get back in there.
"That the air bubble er the gas bubble, I keep saying air bubble, that's wrong."
They are gas bubbles.
The gas bubbles forming along the lines were keeping the acid out of the lines.
So I've swept them away so that the acid can get back in.
When the second set of bubbles is formed  it's done.
That's the rule of thumb.
Okay?
Two formations of bubbles and it's bitten deep enough.
So I suppose that was about two and a half minutes wasn't it?
"town built in our country with two motorways, and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up, it was nothing to do with our friends the  saboteurs."
"It was creeping suburbia then, it wasn't"
Creeping suburbia.
So wha
Yes.
"what do you do now with the, what do the old  the old hunt's people do?"
"Well we've, we just have to er, grin and bear it."
There is nowhere else to go for us.
Yes.
I would like to ask the saboteurs how they can justify  the fact that they ill-treat hounds and horses?
Now I
personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by saboteurs!
I feel this is cruelty to horses.
Yes.
"That's, that's just absolutely rubbish!"
I mean we don't
Well you
"can't, you can't"
"like er, you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe"
Generally speaking
Mm.
"erm, I mean  people who spend their entire Saturday doing something that they, I mean, I don't enjoy going out every Saturday!"
"I mean, I'd like to do the things that, my hobbies, but I go out there because I care and I see that I feel that it's necessary to, to actually stop these people tormenting an animal for fun  and if I'm that concerned about animals, I'm not gonna stoop to  to hurt a horse, or  or the hounds!"
"I mean I ride myself, I have dogs myself, I mean, it's just another excuse from the hunting fraternity, turn it round, blame the cruelty on the saboteurs when really  there wouldn't be any saboteurs if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun!"
Do you want to come back on that?
Yes.
"Erm we ha , we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that I would ask the speaker  who i , what"
Mm.
or who is the fox's predator?
"After all, the mouse has a cat, so what is the fox's predator?"
Do you know much about fox ecology?
Yes.
It doesn't make sense to buy the cheapest brand of baked beans to save a few pence.
It's true.
So then fill your car tank at the most expensive petrol station  in town.
"If you're going to make economies , make efficient ones."
"Similarly, if you are going to be extravagant, be so in an a area,where you're actually going to see the benefit"
So you see
Ha
I told you you should have those two pairs of shoes.
happiness will come to all Virgos  who aim the right arrows at the right targets this weekend .
"Gearoid, what are you?"
It depends.
"It is the nineteenth of February, which one does it fall on theirs?"
Pisces or  Aquarius?
Pisces.
"Aquaria , Aquarius."
Mhm.
"so the term a minor crime I, I don't think is a very good one to be using."
"mm, yes"
I was actually mugged on holiday er then years ago and I was held up with a gun and it was the most horrendous feeling
where was that?
"in Barbados and er some young chaps had saw me lying on the beach and er they stole my bag and they stuck a gun in my face and freeze lady, you don't do any thing, you just let them take what they want and its a horrible feeling when your there, we were there for three weeks and it just totally spoiled the holiday but the ramifications of it don't just stop once you got on the plane home, it was very frightening"
"well your talking about it now and, and with a degree of emotion, do you still feel it?"
"oh, it was feel , it was so terrifying, you just, you regard every one with suspicion after that."
"mm, mm"
"I actually feel, there was a time I used to think it wouldn't happen to me because if I was in that situation I would do this, I would do the next thing and when it did actually happen to me  it took me ages to get over"
mm
the trauma because your so helpless and
"what was, what was the it can I ask that happened?"
mm
I mean if you don't want to say its alright
"no, I don't particularly want to say"
yeah
And she were living in the parks.
Get up here.
Yeah.
"They used to give 'em subsidies to help 'em pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay in the, you know, their housing accommodation, or they've got to stop school."
"In summer holidays, er, the grant don't  they take that six weeks"
Off the grant.
"off the grant, so that actually they get six weeks money less, through the year, than they should do, where they're used to paying all through year"
"For twelve months, now they don't."
"Now, they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school."
No.
"So, you know, any girl that's not living at 'ome."
"She got to go out and work for that six weeks, to, to earn the money  feed the"
"And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only  corner."
"Yeah, but where can you get a job."
"Well, that's it."
Where can you job.
"Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ain't it."
Yeah.
corner.
"I mean, they're begging 'em you to ke they're begging you to keep 'em on at school, and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on."
"It's like other day,we were talking to this bloke like, and he were on about businesses, says you can't underst , oh he said something about finances,how difficult it is to get finance to start a business up  and er, he said, I know, he said you can't me, he said."
"You seen all these adverts about starting your own business, you know, governments like, you know, doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi , you know  hitting your head against a brick wall"
Yeah.
"The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance"
"straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance."
Yeah.
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that.
regulate.
I mean it's
"I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into."
"He's no insurance  no insurance whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it."
I know.
And it might also be that
"the landlords in Saigon are if you like more commercial, more capitalist, it might be they were better organized than landlords in the north."
"I mean th th th the clan links in the south were much stronger than they were in the north, and therefore there might be even greater commercial landlord opposition to land reform than there had been in the north."
Was the south not more erm densely populated as well?
Yes.
Yeah.
So you'd end up putting  much smaller sort of bits of land
Yes.
for each peasant which is going to harm production too.
So there's gonna be less
"There's, there's less"
inequality or
"there's a greater pressure of population  therefore  are you saying that, that  land reform might  at least on the model tried in the north, might not yield any economic benefits"
Mm.
"in terms that, that th th the erm land to  released would be relatively small?"
Yes.
Right.
So the economic gains from  land reform in the south  might not be that great.
"I mean you, the, the more you argue the south is a viable economic system, the less there is to gain from land reform."
erm
and stuff like that
"I mean the amount of land each family will get   if you redistribute land, then the land for the family is not gonna be able to support the family."
Right.
But
Yeah.
Yes
Mm.
Yes.
"Erm  I, I think I might have missed Adam's point and I was going back to  whether the south was more efficient than the north because just tying it in with the seminar we had on managerial farms, weren't there more in the north than in the south?"
"And so then that would just prove that how, managerial farms weren't that much more efficient?"
Er I think those are separate issues.
"You, you, you're right to say that on the whole  there, the managerial farms were in, in the north, although there w there was clearly some in the south"
"Well, it says on the bottom of the, your copy of the charge sheet, production of driving license  you must produce it, failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended  and it also means you've committed yet another offence  by not having  a driving licence here to produce Mr !"
"Well I wa I wasn't sure  whether to, whether it would go through in time for the case  and that's why I haven't"
What's stopping you?
send off for it.
I wasn't sure what the situation was .
"Unless  the prosecutor is in the fortunate position of having  a computer printout of your driving  er le , holding your licence record  the case won't be able to proceed today anyway."
"And your worship, regrettably there is no printout of the driving licence."
Well the case can't go ahead today without  your driving licence.
Sorry?
The case cannot go ahead without your driving licence.
How many weeks do you want to ?
"Your worship, I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout  for the computer to be able to"
And this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer printout will  can be obtained.
Does that mean I don't have to apply for another licence?
"No, but er ee i , I suggest you don't apply for the licence now."
"No, you've left it too late!"
But er  I would urge you to try to find your driving licence  because
"No, I I I don't think I'll be able to because ."
"Right, well  you know you're going to be disqualified eventually for this offence if you're convicted."
Yes.
"What, the offence  the  drink driving offence?"
Yes.
Yeah.
Do you understand?
I realise that.
"You've pleaded guilty to the charge anyhow, it's a fair cop!"
The point is that when you are disqualified you're  not just disqualified from driving you are disqualified from holding or obtaining any driving licence.
So if you've got one at home  you're committing an offence  by being in possession of it.
Do you understand?
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
Right.
Then we'll probably put this case back till later in the day.
Do you see that Mr ?
Because you're not represented
Well I don't know what the situation is!
"Well I'm te , that's what I'm trying to tell you!"
You'll have to .
But because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out!
Which will er  take quite some time and er will
and certainly will if you're reading to the court which was something you were concerned about.
I'm not   .
I don't know whether you can help that man with that.
"Because Mr  has represented him, Mr  said before that he he thought it was as duty solicitor  that he, he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor  but, he is represented under legal aid though this defendant  by a firm of solicitors in Birmingham  and he's anxious to be committed for trial  today."
"If he was represented we could do it er, on the section six two."
Otherwise
Are there any solicitors present today?
"Not at present, but he doesn't know ."
Oh I see.
He's given certain information to the court which  isn't correct anyway!
Have a word with him.
It might help everybody concerned if you could have a word with .
Yes.
We'll have a word with .
Could you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worship?
"Shaun David , Mr  represents him."
Are you Shaun David ?
Yes.
What's your date of birth Mr ?
Twenty fourth of the seventh sixty seven.
What is your address  Mr ?
.
"Well you're charged with two offenses, the first of which is that at Clitheroe  on the twenty sixth of August nineteen eighty eight without lawful excuse  you damaged two stained glass windows  a picture frame glass and twelve  glasses of varying descriptions  belonging to Whitbread Breweries  intending to damage that property and the being reckless as to whether that property would be damaged  contrary to section one of the criminal damage act in nineteen seventy one."
"I understand this value, value has been mentioned on a previous occasion, I think three hundred and ninety five pounds?"
Yes.
"Erm, being with the S S P C A, I have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals, but one of the saddest photographs I saw, quite recently was  two monkeys, well they're primates, we are"
Yep.
"part of that family too, and they were in a lab awaiting experimentation and they were  in cages side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands, almost as though, to give each other comfort."
Mhm.
Monkeys feel pain.
"They feel happiness, sadness  and they also have a sense of humour."
Under the nineteen eighty six act
Mm.
"they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office, as well as locally."
"I mean, it's it's  vets etcetera"
Yeah.
Yep.
"are always present in research establishments to ensure  the well being of the animals, and very often there is actually no pain  involved in the research."
"How, how do you know that?"
Well I was told by somebody who's involved in animal
Right.
research!
Right.
"But er, frequently the animals are used  for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed humanly before the research actually takes place."
"But do we find it acceptable that animals should be used, however painless the event."
Well I would rather use an animal any time that my own child!
Up there.
"Er, Switzerland is one country that has banned the use of animals for research, and I think we ought to be going along these lines  that, if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for experimentation."
Mhm.
"And if we were to ban the the process,th erm  we would devise other means for research, would, we would find alternatives."
There.
"Th there'll, there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it."
It's quite
"alright, they move it out of Switzerland  but if we can't have it here we'll have it in Pakistan or somewhere  where they want the money!"
So it won't make any difference  in that
Yes?
What's the what's the primary method of of getting contact with the audience?
Well the method
Eyes
looking at them
"Yeah using the eyes, yeah, okay."
Both to to to feel to make them feel involved and to er gauge the reaction gauge how things are going so you can er get some feedback on how you're doing.
Okay
You need to keep their interest don't you?
"Oh absolutely, yes, I mean I mean"
the effect
Sure  erm no amount of audience contact will compensate for a boring subject.
"Yeah, oh yes I erm erm I'm not saying that and that's when we come on to the the design and the content that we put in."
"Yeah, you're absolutely right  very important point yeah no amount of eye contact is going to compensate for something that that doesn't hold their interest."
Okay.
What else then what other methods do we have besides having eye contact what else might we do to involve the audience to make them feel involved?
Questions
"Yes, absolutely so questions er a very definite way of involving the audience and again it gives a measure of feedback doesn't it because if you get the right answer you know that they are with you and you know they are understanding what you have to say."
"But obviously if there's some hesitation over it then perhaps you just need to step back a stage in what you're saying and er er go over it again to for clarity, and Tony what's another way of involving the audience?"
Well you've got to get them to participate but I suppose you would do if you question them
Well yes I guess you would.
Jeff what's another way that you might make the audience feel that they're involved?
Mike
Well yes okay that's a possibility and that's something that we'll come on to tomorrow.
"But in terms of audience contact, Sarah"
Jokes
Well yeah yeah a bit of humour a bit of humour
Smile at them
Smile at them well yeah okay.
"Bob, another way of involving the audience making them feel part of it"
Ask them to relate their experiences
Yes okay but that in a way comes under questions doesn't it yes.
Ask them
In this dictionary of phrase and fable.
"Brewer equates black sheep with bet noir, the eyesore in the flock, a disgrace, something unpleasing."
Sheep used to be of great importance to the British economy.
"Black sheep was often despised by shepherds, and their wool was less valuable."
"Nevertheless, even black sheep were used for export."
"Okay, that's that's the bit of erm, sheep background."
"The nursery rhyme then, comes from Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book from around seventeen forty-four, and the division of bags, one for the master, one for the dame, one for the little boy who where wherever he is, lives down the lane, is said to refer to the export tax on wool, which was imposed as far back as twelve seventy-five, making even the outsider sheep of value."
So black sheep are different.
"The term is used negatively, but the black sheep of the family maybe an attractive person, someone with a sparkle, with a courage to be different, with a courage to defy the norm."
"Everyone, is says, can think of black sheep of their acquaintance."
"Every can you think of a black sheep of your acquaintance, do you do you."
"No, I don't whether I can."
Not  acquaintance.
"Perhaps I've, perhaps I've, perhaps I've mixed in a very sheltered society."
"Perhaps family history, perhaps, but not the very"
"Yes, yes."
No.
"I don't think er, and of course, er, again perhaps the idea of a black sheep, has changed over the years."
"Erm, circumstances which made someone, perhaps fifty years ago, considered to be the black sheep of the family, wouldn't necessarily be the same now."
No.
Mm.
"Erm, spivs."
I I don't think I had anybody in my family who was a spiv.
"But there was somebody in in the street where I lived, who was a spiv, and he was considered to be the black sheep of the family, didn't quite fit in when everybody else did."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Nowadays, you know, erm, don't know whether that sort of thing"
"Enterprise, culture."
"En enterprise, culture, yes indeed."
"Yes, yes."
"Er, I mean in the olden days, they used, they they usually the  sent to the colonies or, sent into the army or or into religion, weren't they."
Mm.
And all the estate men first of all would get everything.
And all the crofters then that was paying rent.
In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate?
Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths.
They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
The pools?
Yes the pools.
That's the salmon pools
Mm.
you see.
And they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men.
To cross the the
Yes just yes you see
the streams .
it still on the the rivers.
But now it's made of stonework or or concrete.
Mm.
Now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand
Mhm.
to the weather.
But er that's the way.
And the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge.
And the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that.
And painters and joiners they would have themselves.
All self-contained?
Yes self-contained yes.
There'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a
"Erm  what, what we do today is to  way go back over some of the ideas about land reform and then carry them through to the ninety fifty er Agrarian Reform Bill."
Erm   what we've been looking at is  the process of land reform.
"Tt  and we're obviously looking at a process of land reform which has, has undergone a number of changes and I think we, we've begun to see some of the influences on those changes and particularly over the, the last week or so the  this has ."
"Tt er  and i in a sense there's kind of been an upward trend in terms of progression through that, that reform but within that there have obviously been a number of  and in a sense what we've been coming to terms with is, is what has been causing those, those variations, those changes in that policy."
he's got  times
Time
"when ready, weight, number of packages, destination, and then haz"
Well done.
Haz will do nicely for me.
"That's what we're really looking for, hazardous"
Yeah.
goods.
Well done.
"Because, how can I say"
"Even, even I take"
"we've, you'll see, I mean there's a, not a very good illustration of a, the hub with the yellow walls of the, the conveyer belt behind you, but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in."
"The more, er er sophisticated erm  wholesale er  distributors now  know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they?"
"And, they may have one display displayed, but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your  you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's illustrating a Flymo  lawn mower or something and, and it'll, er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging, but, a lot of people for pilferage reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate, from our point of view, what's on the package."
But you must know what's in it.
"Just knowing the size and the weight isn't, you might, that's alright, that's only for the price  what's in it is vital  because  if I asked the sales people  from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them?"
"Do reme , can yo , can I, can you guess at how many would say I don't know?"
Major customers.
Half a dozen.
"It's a lo , I, I'd sa , they wouldn't admit it Bill, they might say something like erm  oh it's electronics, but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic."
Would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box.
"You don't put , you shouldn't, but you should know."
You should declare it.
"They should declare if it's hazardous, infectious, infested,i it will, what's word you used?"
Incestuous weren't it?
Incestuous?
Was that a word.
Infested.
"Infested, contaminated"
Yes it is.
or fragile goods.
"Dangerous,haz really, he should declare it, and people don't you know, unless you ask."
I'm gonna have a  a bowl of water handy just in case.
So having put on these er temporary protective gloves.
These are ones I bought long time ago.
"Erm they're  as you can see, still a bit awkward but much easier to use than these."
What do you think the other piece of protective gear I might need would be?
Goggles.
Goggles.
Good.
And I have a pair of goggles here but there is another safety device built into this which is this window.
"In fact the tray of acid will go in there  so any splashing around I might do, any upward splashing is not likely to reach ."
You will be relieved to know I've ordered some new  rubber gloves like this and some new goggles  for next term.
But you don't need to use them this term anyway so it's alright.
The acid we use is nitric acid.
"It's very very dilute, only fifteen percent acid  the rest is water."
And I have used this particular acid already to etch zinc.
Can't hear you.
Oh.
"I just, I'll just ."
I'll see you later.
Consequently this acid now contains some zinc which has eaten it away.
there'll be a residue of zinc in there.
"The other metal which I mentioned to you before which is the traditional method for  etching is copper, copper plate."
"And I am told that it is not advisable to use the same batch of acid for etching copper as has been used for etching zinc because the  deposits of two metals in the acid creates erm an unpleasant, noxious, possibly poisonous gas and I don't know what that would do."
"Talking about gas, even this produces gas."
Therefore you have this machine which is an extractor.
It's called a  a fume cupboard I think.
A s sort of cupboard.
It's open at the front.
It has to be because we have to get our hands in.
But it's extracting the fumes going out the window.
Possibly not very  ecologically sound but safer for you at all events.
This hasn't been used for some time so it's a bit so I'm just going to wipe it out so  there are no particles or foreign bodies in there.
If people are new we need to train them to get the maximum competent level don't we?
If they've been with us for quite some time there are always ways we can enhance people's skills aren't there?
"There are always ways that we could make people more effective or help people to  got the wrong flip, but, but to grow into other jobs."
"So that's the training cycle  and we believe that if you follow that approach to training, then it will help you to be very effective and successful."
That's something that we definitely do here.
Right first of all  I said it was an overview and that's all it was.
"What we wanted to look at to start with was why training is so important, whose responsibility training is and lastly a systematic approach to training."
"What we're gonna do now, it's just coming up to twenty past three, so we'll take a tea break and then after tea we'll come back and we'll spend about an hour or so looking at identifying trainees."
We'll look at what you're currently doing and we also suggest to you something that you could be doing.
Any questions?
Quite happy?
"Right, so we'll take tea then."
It's just coming up to twenty past three we'll take fifteen minutes.
"That's a bit impressive Dawn, fifteen minutes"
blimey.
We were only given ten on the first day.
unfortunately
Yeah and I need the diction I dunno why .
"Asking questions referring, do you get that situation whereby you're told something two or three times and yet they keep coming back?"
"Is it a training need, or could it just be the fact that if they pass it on to you, they know you're dead?"
"Two aspects of that, but I think that's a good way of identifying training."
"Yeah, we're on the training cycle again  another one."
contact with the outside world  customer services
"So what would you, how would you identify from that?"
There's no margin
So we got two then on to errors and erm complaints.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What you said?
Yeah.
"It says, you know broadening it out a bit so we can be a bit more specific."
Alright.
oh can I remember that far back
erm
loss of memory?
yes definitely that erm
loss of common sense certainly.
"would you agree the ninety three of you, is that what characterises being in love, temporary madness?, any other, no well what then?, yes"
"Er yeah, sorry, I write romantic fictions not just lust"
yes
"Being in love I think erm its not something that you have to end it happens to you, its not because er a terribly admire the person I er, your only achievements, its just something that happens and common sense goes out the window."
so you suggest that Sandra might be right?
something like
and
there might be something in it yes
"erm, yes, up there"
"Well I don't agree with that, I think that when your in love with someone you want to be with them all the time, you think about them during the day, you think about them at night, you just want to be with them and usually you like how they look, you like how they talk, they like, you like how they treat you and er to me that's, its wonderful, just"
has
wonderful
how many times has this happened to you?
many times
"many times, at one time I thought it would never happen again, I thought this was it forever, but life isn't like that, things happen and it does change."
yes
"It, it is a form of an obsession and it is an excitement and there's a warmth and there's a funniness about it and it just wonderful, better being in love than not being in love surely."
"mm, yes"
"No I feel er kind a be lost, it depends on what relationship your looking for."
"I think if its the right one its definitely not lust its every minute admiration for them, just to be with that person."
"so, so lust is what you feel for the wrong one?"
That's afterwards
"yes, I, first meet them, then you can say its lust."
there
Can you not start with being in love with someone and end up by loving them?
Yes
it isn't always a drastic ending is it?
And erm
insure documents anyway.
"We don't er  offer transit liability on documents because we only  that is a flat piece of paper to us, it isn't a valuable item."
"We don't con , the, you know, what the arrangement is."
Mm.
"If it's your marriage contract and you don't get married because you don't got, that's not our fault."
"We just  cos we don't ins , it's only a piece of paper to us, you see."
So documents do not get transit liability on them at all.
"And tenders and deadlines can be particularly sensitive to that, but you cannot offer transit liability."
"But even if this tape is going to record the last speech of  somebody famous and it didn't get and therefore they couldn't record it, that is co , the consequence of a delay, you know, a fall of snow or  our vehicle breaking down or something not being done, or missed some  in human, some human error, it's not our, we don't lay, we'll give, we'll insure or  offer transit liability on the value of the goods providing you've got additional full transit liability with us, but we won't for the loss of business because you didn't get it."
"Is that, can anybody think of a, a courier  of documents, it's still the same."
I think that's why super mail offers  on large goods.
Mm.
It's better than one.
Mm.
Mhm.
Yes.
"No we don't do ta , erm  the conditions of ca , there's, there's a slight sort of"
"on conditions of carriage for the same day operation but, not in that league at all."
"On super mail, if that item doesn't arrive in a set time"
Mm mm.
"what do you make up for, just their postage?"
It might be more mightn't it?
The consignment or
Yeah.
the nearest nearest service value.
"If they send out a document that weighs a kilo for tapes and they sent that one, they're losing twenty"
It'll lose it's value
rather than say if it doesn't arrive at a set time
That wouldn't make any difference.
then it's covered for them.
It's E
"I, I've never really heard of women attacking lesbian women or women attacking gay men, its usually if there's a if there's a row something or other because the male of the species seems the one who's been, feels very, very threatened at the"

"Can I er, compound the issue more?"
"mm, mm"
"and, and say there is again disrespect or whatever for, I don't know what to call them transracial relationships"
"mm, mm"
because that's another problem and I think maybe people haven't you know like addressed that.
"can, can I just move on to one other issue that I'd like to look at er, because I think we've covered that reasonably for the moment which is, how, how will you find love?, ninety three people said their, their were in love, seven said they weren't, of those seven were, you've never been in love, was it, have, have you wanted to be?, would any of the seven who voted no at the beginning, yes"
Not really
ah
you didn't fancy it?
"no, I'm too in my, I like my independence too much, yes."
any one else  yes
"I think I was er, I thought I was in love a few times, but erm in retrospect it was lust"
"so that's, that's,"
"thought that half of you being in love was, was lust any way."
"Where, where do you find love?, if their are people out watching this programme tonight who would actually rather be in love"
Love finds you
eh?
love finds you
don't give up hope it finds you
thank you
"Also like, why, why, do people want to find love?, like is it maybe lulling them into a false sense of si security erm and I think that it is really important as like one woman said earlier on that its really important to love yourself first, cos how can you give any body any thing"
"mm, mm"
"I think love is like, when somebody loves you, loves you for just being yourself"
aha
"I, I think to me that would be the greatest"
respects you also
"yeah, no matter who you are."
Sadie
"Okay, how does that affect trade?"
Well it's easier to transport things overseas or wherever.
"Also storage is easier, improving"
"Right, super, anything else?"
Population growth.
"Yes, populations have, have increased."
Technology.
"Yep, I mean that might in a sense"
"Yes, we're gonna get"
"Transport technology has er, certainly er, certainly improved."
"Right, okay, so, in ge in general, we can say that world trade has risen over time due to essentially, well, is that, is there anything else that?"
"more countries have er, a big surplus, and more countries having a big deficit in food supply"
Yes
so therefore
"so that says something about specialization of production possibly, that countries are now more highly specialized than they once were."
"Yep, I mean, that in a way is a function of, leagues with which international trade can be conducted."
"You know, if you, if international trade is very difficult as it was, say two hundred years ago, then you've got to be self sufficient."
"Whereas, erm, you can now exploit individual countries comparative advantage of this trade erm, is, is rel is relatively er, is relatively easy."
"Are there any other factors, that might have increased, for an incre might have led to an increase in world trade?"
"Rising population, improving transport and technologies."
"I know this might sound obscure, but erm, I read somewhere when  that erm, if you actually bring in protectionism, it sounds like it could actually increase trade."
If you bring in protectionism?
"Don't know how it worked, as in"
"As of, liberalize, or if you increase"
"No, if you actually, you know, if you have a little protectionism, it does actually lead to an increase in trade, but I don't know how that works."
Neither do I.
"No it doesn't, you know it doesn't."
I really didn't expect
"Right, okay, let's say that's a new one on me."
Okay.
"Well, we'll come onto protectionism in er, in a minute."
"What other factors, there's a big, this fact that we're missing, alright, rising population, improvements in transport and technology, what else has happened over the last hundred years?"
"Thereupon he fell in a muse , looking in the embers of the fire ; and presently , getting a piece of wood , he fashioned it in a cross , the four ends of which he blackened on the coals ."
Then he looked at me a little shyly .
`` Could ye lend me my button ? ''
says he .
"`` It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again , but I own I am laith to cut another . ''"
"I gave him the button ; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross ; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir , he looked upon his work with satisfaction ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there is a little clachan '' -LRB- what is called a hamlet in the English -RRB- `` not very far from Corrynakiegh , and it has the name of Koalisnacoan ."
"There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life , and some that I am no just so sure of ."
"Ye see , David , there will be money set upon our heads ; James himsel ' is to set money on them ; and as for the Campbells , they would never spare siller where there was a Stewart to be hurt ."
"If it was otherwise , I would go down to Koalisnacoan whatever , and trust my life into these people 's hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove . ''"
`` But being so ? ''
"said I. `` Being so , '' said he , `` I would as lief they didnae see me ."
"There 's bad folk everywhere , and what 's far worse , weak ones ."
"So when it comes dark again , I will steal down into that clachan , and set this that I have been making in the window of a good friend of mine , John Breck Maccoll , a bouman * of Appin 's . ''"
* A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares with him the increase .
"`` With all my heart , '' says I ; `` and if he finds it , what is he to think ? ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` I wish he was a man of more penetration , for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it !"
But this is what I have in my mind .
"This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie , or fiery cross , which is the signal of gathering in our clans ; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise , for there it is standing in his window , and no word with it ."
"So he will say to himsel ' , THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE , BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ."
"Then he will see my button , and that was Duncan Stewart 's ."
"And then he will say to himsel ' , THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER , AND HAS NEED OF ME . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it may be ."
"But even supposing so , there is a good deal of heather between here and the Forth . ''"
"`` And that is a very true word , '' says Alan ."
"`` But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine ; and he will say to himsel ' -LRB- if he is a man of any penetration at all , which I misdoubt -RRB- , ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES ."
"Then he will think to himsel ' , THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT ; and then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh ."
"And if he does not , David , the devil may fly away with him , for what I care ; for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' said I , drolling with him a little , `` you 're very ingenious !"
But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white ? ''
"`` And that is an excellent observe , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , '' says Alan , drolling with me ; `` and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him , but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it ."
He would have to go to the school for two-three years ; and it 's possible we might be wearied waiting on him . ''
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed ."
"`` Oh , Tony , '' she would say , with awful respect , `` but the fairies will be so angry ! ''"
"`` I daresay , '' replied Tony , carelessly ."
"`` Perhaps , '' she said , thrilling , `` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ''"
"`` I shall make him , '' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , `` Just some day ; '' he was quite vague about which day except when she asked `` Will it be today ? ''"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond , not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , `` Is it to-day ? ''"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him !
"`` In case you should feel cold , '' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , `` I 'm afraid Nurse would see me , so I sha 'n' t be able to do it . ''"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , `` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , '' and in a whisper , `` Then you can hide , '' and off they ran ."
"Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore , being stunned with the horror of that screaming ; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason woke up , as if out of a muse , and bade them lay hands upon Alan ."
"They hung back indeed , having little taste for the employment ; but Hoseason was like a fiend , crying that Alan was alone , that he had a great sum about him , that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades , and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast ."
It was seven against one ; in that part of the shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to ; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him .
"`` And then , '' said Alan , `` the little man with the red head -- I havenae mind of the name that he is called . ''"
"`` Riach , '' said I. `` Ay '' said Alan , `` Riach !"
"Well , it was him that took up the clubs for me , asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment , and , says he ` Dod , I 'll put my back to the Hielandman 's mysel ' . '"
"That 's none such an entirely bad little man , yon little man with the red head , '' said Alan ."
`` He has some spunks of decency . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` he was kind to me in his way . ''"
"`` And so he was to Alan , '' said he ; `` and by my troth , I found his way a very good one !"
"But ye see , David , the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man ; and I 'm thinking that would be the cause of it . ''"
"`` Well , I would think so , '' says I ; `` for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning ."
But how did Hoseason take it ? ''
"`` It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill , '' says Alan ."
"`` But the little man cried to me to run , and indeed I thought it was a good observe , and ran ."
"The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the beach , like folk that were not agreeing very well together . ''"
`` What do you mean by that ? ''
"said I. `` Well , the fists were going , '' said Alan ; `` and I saw one man go down like a pair of breeks ."
But I thought it would be better no to wait .
"Ye see there 's a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull , which is no good company for a gentleman like me ."
"If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel ' , let alone giving a hand to the little man . ''"
"-LRB- It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach 's stature , for , to say the truth , the one was not much smaller than the other . -RRB-"
"`` So , '' says he , continuing , `` I set my best foot forward , and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore ."
"Man , they didnae stop to fash with me !"
Ye should have seen them linking for the beach !
"And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run , which is aye good for a Campbell ."
I 'm thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didnae break .
"But it was a very unlucky thing for you , that same ; for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low , and would soon have found ye . ''"
"CHAPTER XIX THE HOUSE OF FEAR Night fell as we were walking , and the clouds , which had broken up in the afternoon , settled in and thickened , so that it fell , for the season of the year , extremely dark ."
"The way we went was over rough mountainsides ; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner , I could by no means see how he directed himself ."
"At last , about half-past ten of the clock , we came to the top of a brae , and saw lights below us ."
"It seemed a house door stood open and let out a beam of fire and candle-light ; and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about , each carrying a lighted brand ."
"When two people do n't care overly much for each other , Nora May , a quarrel never amounts to much between them , and it 's soon made up ."
But when they love each other better than life it cuts so deep and hurts so much that nine times out of ten they wo n't ever forgive each other .
"The more you love anybody , Nora May , the more he can hurt you ."
"To be sure , you 're too young to be thinking of such things ."
"It all came like a thunderclap on Gil 's friends here at Greendale , because we had n't ever suspected things were going wrong ."
"The first thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary 's , eighty miles away , and Gilbert , he went out to Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there ."
It just about broke his parents ' hearts .
He was their only child and they just worshipped him .
"Gil and Anne both wrote to me off and on , but never a word , not so much as a name , did they say of each other ."
"I 'd ` a ' writ and asked 'em the rights of the fuss if I could , in hopes of patching it up , but I ca n't write now -- my hand is too shaky -- and mebbe it was just as well , for meddling is terribly risky work in a love trouble , Nora May ."
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddles with is worse than the first .
"So I just set tight and said nothing , while everybody else in the clan was talking Anne and Gil sixty words to the minute ."
"Well , last birthday morning I was feeling terrible disperrited ."
"I had made up my mind that my birthday was always to be a good thing for other people , and there did n't seem one blessed thing I could do to make anybody glad ."
Emma Matilda and George and the children were all well and happy and wanted for nothing that I could give them .
"I begun to be afraid I 'd lived long enough , Nora May ."
"When a woman gets to the point where she ca n't give a gift of joy to anyone , there ai n't much use in her living ."
I felt real old and worn out and useless .
"I was sitting here under these very trees -- they was just budding out in leaf then , as young and cheerful as if they was n't a hundred years old ."
"And I sighed right out loud and said , `` Oh , Grandpa Holland , it 's time I was put away up on the hill there with you . ''"
"And with that the gate banged and there was Nancy Jane Whitmore 's boy , Sam , with two letters for me ."
One was from Anne up at St. Mary 's and the other was from Gil out in Manitoba .
I read Anne 's first .
She just struck right into things in the first paragraph .
"She said her year at St. Mary 's was nearly up , and when it was she meant to quit teaching and go away to New York and learn to be a trained nurse ."
"She said she was just broken-hearted about Gilbert , and would always love him to the day of her death ."
"But she knew he did n't care anything more about her after the way he had acted , and there was nothing left for her in life but to do something for other people , and so on and so on , for twelve mortal pages ."
"Anne is a fine writer , and I just cried like a babe over that letter , it was so touching , although I was enjoying myself hugely all the time , I was so delighted to find out that Anne loved Gilbert still ."
"I was getting skeered she did n't , her letters all winter had been so kind of jokey and frivolous , all about the good times she was having , and the parties she went to , and the new dresses she got ."
New dresses !
"When I read that letter of Anne 's , I knew that all the purple and fine linen in the world was just like so much sackcloth and ashes to her as long as Gilbert was sulking out on a prairie farm ."
"Well , I wiped my eyes and polished up my specs , but I might have spared myself the trouble , for in five minutes , Nora May , there was I sobbing again ; over Gilbert 's letter ."
For generosity 's sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head ; but I thought of it none the less .
"I thought of it all the more , too , when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold , and the best part of another in small change ."
"True , it was more than I had ."
"But then Alan , with less than five guineas , had to get as far as France ; I , with my less than two , not beyond Queensferry ; so that taking things in their proportion , Alan 's society was not only a peril to my life , but a burden on my purse ."
But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion .
"He believed he was serving , helping , and protecting me ."
"And what could I do but hold my peace , and chafe , and take my chance of it ?"
"`` It 's little enough , '' said Alan , putting the purse in his pocket , `` but it 'll do my business ."
"And now , John Breck , if ye will hand me over my button , this gentleman and me will be for taking the road . ''"
"But the bouman , after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the Highland manner -LRB- though he wore otherwise the Lowland habit , with sea-trousers -RRB- , began to roll his eyes strangely , and at last said , `` Her nainsel will loss it , '' meaning he thought he had lost it ."
`` What ! ''
"cried Alan , `` you will lose my button , that was my father 's before me ?"
"Now I will tell you what is in my mind , John Breck : it is in my mind this is the worst day 's work that ever ye did since ye was born . ''"
"And as Alan spoke , he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth , and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies ."
"Perhaps the bouman was honest enough ; perhaps he had meant to cheat and then , finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place , cast back to honesty as being safer ; at least , and all at once , he seemed to find that button and handed it to Alan ."
"`` Well , and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls , '' said Alan , and then to me , `` Here is my button back again , and I thank you for parting with it , which is of a piece with all your friendships to me . ''"
Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman .
"`` For , '' says he , `` ye have done very well by me , and set your neck at a venture , and I will always give you the name of a good man . ''"
"Lastly , the bouman took himself off by one way ; and Alan and I -LRB- getting our chattels together -RRB- struck into another to resume our flight ."
"CHAPTER XXII THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE MOOR Some seven hours ' incessant , hard travelling brought us early in the morning to the end of a range of mountains ."
"In front of us there lay a piece of low , broken , desert land , which we must now cross ."
"The sun was not long up , and shone straight in our eyes ; a little , thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke ; so that -LRB- as Alan said -RRB- there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser ."
"We sat down , therefore , in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should have risen , and made ourselves a dish of drammach , and held a council of war ."
"`` David , '' said Alan , `` this is the kittle bit ."
"Shall we lie here till it comes night , or shall we risk it , and stave on ahead ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I am tired indeed , but I could walk as far again , if that was all . ''"
"`` Ay , but it isnae , '' said Alan , `` nor yet the half ."
This is how we stand : Appin 's fair death to us .
"To the south it 's all Campbells , and no to be thought of ."
"To the north ; well , there 's no muckle to be gained by going north ; neither for you , that wants to get to Queensferry , nor yet for me , that wants to get to France ."
"Well , then , we 'll can strike east . ''"
`` East be it ! ''
"So saying , the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door ."
"I was very uneasy and alarmed , as you may fancy , and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself ."
He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat .
"At last in strode the captain , slammed the door behind him , without looking to the right or left , and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him ."
"`` Bill , '' said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big ."
"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us ; all the brown had gone out of his face , and even his nose was blue ; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost , or the evil one , or something worse , if anything can be ; and upon my word , I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick ."
"`` Come , Bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , Bill , surely , '' said the stranger ."
The captain made a sort of gasp .
`` Black Dog ! ''
said he .
`` And who else ? ''
"returned the other , getting more at his ease ."
"`` Black Dog as ever was , come for to see his old shipmate Billy , at the Admiral Benbow inn ."
"Ah , Bill , Bill , we have seen a sight of times , us two , since I lost them two talons , '' holding up his mutilated hand ."
"`` Now , look here , '' said the captain ; `` you 've run me down ; here I am ; well , then , speak up ; what is it ? ''"
"`` That 's you , Bill , '' returned Black Dog , `` you 're in the right of it , Billy ."
"I 'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , as I 've took such a liking to ; and we 'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmates . ''"
"When I returned with the rum , they were already seated on either side of the captain 's breakfast-table -- Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , as I thought , on his retreat ."
He bade me go and leave the door wide open .
"`` None of your keyholes for me , sonny , '' he said ; and I left them together and retired into the bar ."
"For a long time , though I certainly did my best to listen , I could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voices began to grow higher , and I could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain ."
"`` No , no , no , no ; and an end of it ! ''"
he cried once .
"And again , `` If it comes to swinging , swing all , say I. '' Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises -- the chair and table went over in a lump , a clash of steel followed , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursuing , both with drawn cutlasses , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder ."
"Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow ."
You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day .
That blow was the last of the battle .
"Once out upon the road , Black Dog , in spite of his wound , showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute ."
"The captain , for his part , stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man ."
Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house .
"`` Jim , '' says he , `` rum '' ; and as he spoke , he reeled a little , and caught himself with one hand against the wall ."
`` Are you hurt ? ''
I 'm sorry on your account ; but you need n't say a word at the cranky places .
I 'll do all the talking ... Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to .
Mrs. Lynde does n't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not .
"She inclines to , when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it ; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it ."
So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde 's eyes .
"Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting , and I expect it will be good , for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family ."
I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla 's aunt .
It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote ` Edgewood Days ' and ` The Rosebud Garden . ' ''
`` Where does Mrs. Morgan live ? ''
`` In Toronto .
"And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer , and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her ."
That seems almost too good to be true -- but it 's something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed . ''
The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact .
"Gilbert Blythe was president , Fred Wright vice-president , Anne Shirley secretary , and Diana Barry treasurer ."
"The `` Improvers , '' as they were promptly christened , were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members ."
"It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season ; but they meant to plan the next summer 's campaign , collect and discuss ideas , write and read papers , and , as Anne said , educate the public sentiment generally ."
"There was some disapproval , of course , and ... which the Improvers felt much more keenly ... a good deal of ridicule ."
Mr. Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club .
Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums .
Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society .
Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill .
Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed .
Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows .
"Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane , an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory , if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it ."
"In spite of ... or perhaps , human nature being what it is , because of ... this , the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall ."
"At the second meeting , in the Barry parlor , Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle and paint the hall ; Julia Bell seconded it , with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike ."
"Gilbert put the motion , it was carried unanimously , and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes ."
"The next thing was to appoint a committee , and Gertie Pye , determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels , boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee ."
"This motion being also duly seconded and carried , Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee , along with Gilbert , Anne , Diana , and Fred Wright ."
The committee chose their routes in private conclave .
"Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road , Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road , and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road ."
"`` Because , '' explained Gilbert to Anne , as they walked home together through the Haunted Wood , `` the Pyes all live along that road and they wo n't give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them . ''"
"`` Then do go to sleep , '' said Nan , pettishly ."
`` I want my own bed .
"Oh , I wish I could see Teddy ! ''"
"cried Rob , painfully reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests ."
"`` I do n't believe your mother will ever find us , '' said Nan , who was becoming desperate , for she hated patient waiting of any sort ."
`` It 's so dark she wo n't see us . ''
"`` It was all black in the ice-house , and I was so scared I did n't call her , but she saw me ; and she will see me now , no matter how dark it is , '' returned confiding Rob , standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him ."
`` I see her !
I see her ! ''
"he cried , and ran as fast as his tired legs would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching ."
"Suddenly he stopped , then turned about , and came stumbling back , screaming in a great panic , `` No , it 's a bear , a big black one ! ''"
and hid his face in Nan 's skirts .
"For a moment Nan quailed ; ever her courage gave out at the thought of a real bear , and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder , when a mild `` Moo ! ''"
"changed her fear to merriment , as she said , laughing , `` It 's a cow , Robby !"
"the nice , black cow we saw this afternoon . ''"
"The cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two little people in her pasture after dark , and the amiable beast paused to inquire into the case ."
"She let them stroke her , and stood regarding them with her soft eyes so mildly , that Nan , who feared no animal but a bear , was fired with a desire to milk her ."
"`` Silas taught me how ; and berries and milk would be so nice , '' she said , emptying the contents of her pail into her hat , and boldly beginning her new task , while Rob stood by and repeated , at her command , the poem from Mother Goose : `` Cushy cow , bonny , let down your milk , Let down your milk to me , And I will give you a gown of silk , A gown of silk and a silver tee . ''"
"But the immortal rhyme had little effect , for the benevolent cow had already been milked , and had only half a gill to give the thirsty children ."
`` Shoo !
get away !
"you are an old cross patch , '' cried Nan , ungratefully , as she gave up the attempt in despair ; and poor Molly walked on with a gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof ."
"`` Each can have a sip , and then we must take a walk ."
We shall go to sleep if we do n't ; and lost people must n't sleep .
Do n't you know how Hannah Lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died ? ''
"`` But there is n't any snow now , and it 's nice and warm , '' said Rob , who was not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan ."
"`` No matter , we will poke about a little , and call some more ; and then , if nobody comes , we will hide under the bushes , like Hop - ` o-my-thumb and his brothers . ''"
"It was a very short walk , however , for Rob was so sleepy he could not get on , and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience , being half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself ."
"`` If you tumble down again , I 'll shake you , '' she said , lifting the poor little man up very kindly as she spoke , for Nan 's bark was much worse than her bite ."
`` Please do n't .
"It 's my boots they keep slipping so ; '' and Rob manfully checked the sob just ready to break out , adding , with a plaintive patience that touched Nan 's heart , `` If the skeeters did n't bite me so , I could go to sleep till Marmar comes . ''"
"`` Put your head on my lap , and I 'll cover you up with my apron ; I 'm not afraid of the night , '' said Nan , sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her ."
"Even as I spoke on these grave subjects , my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect , and my heart jump with pride ."
"About my clear duty to my friend , the lawyer had no doubt ."
"I must help him out of the county at whatever risk ; but in the case of James , he was of a different mind ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , '' says he , `` is one thing , Mr. Thomson 's kinsman quite another ."
"I know little of the facts , but I gather that a great noble -LRB- whom we will call , if you like , the D. of A. -RRB- * has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter ."
"The D. of A. is doubtless an excellent nobleman ; but , Mr. David , timeo qui nocuere deos ."
"If you interfere to balk his vengeance , you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out ; and that is to put you in the dock ."
"There , you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ."
"You will object that you are innocent ; well , but so is he ."
"And to be tried for your life before a Highland jury , on a Highland quarrel and with a Highland Judge upon the bench , would be a brief transition to the gallows . ''"
* The Duke of Argyle .
Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them ; so I put on all the simplicity I could .
"`` In that case , sir , '' said I , `` I would just have to be hanged -- would I not ? ''"
"`` My dear boy , '' cries he , `` go in God 's name , and do what you think is right ."
It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful ; and I take it back with an apology .
"Go and do your duty ; and be hanged , if you must , like a gentleman ."
There are worse things in the world than to be hanged . ''
"`` Not many , sir , '' said I , smiling ."
"`` Why , yes , sir , '' he cried , `` very many ."
And it would be ten times better for your uncle -LRB- to go no farther afield -RRB- if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet . ''
"Thereupon he turned into the house -LRB- still in a great fervour of mind , so that I saw I had pleased him heartily -RRB- and there he wrote me two letters , making his comments on them as he wrote ."
"`` This , '' says he , `` is to my bankers , the British Linen Company , placing a credit to your name ."
"Consult Mr. Thomson , he will know of ways ; and you , with this credit , can supply the means ."
"I trust you will be a good husband of your money ; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson , I would be even prodigal ."
"Then for his kinsman , there is no better way than that you should seek the Advocate , tell him your tale , and offer testimony ; whether he may take it or not , is quite another matter , and will turn on the D. of A. Now , that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended , I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own , the learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig , a man whom I esteem ."
It will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name ; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant .
"I would not trouble him , if I were you , with any particulars ; and -LRB- do you know ? -RRB-"
I think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson .
"Form yourself upon the laird , he is a good model ; when you deal with the Advocate , be discreet ; and in all these matters , may the Lord guide you , Mr. David ! ''"
"Thereupon he took his farewell , and set out with Torrance for the Ferry , while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh ."
"As we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge , we kept looking back at the house of my fathers ."
"It stood there , bare and great and smokeless , like a place not lived in ; only in one of the top windows , there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward , like the head of a rabbit from a burrow ."
"`` Patience is a tired mare but she jogs on , '' said Susan ."
"`` While the steeds of Armageddon thunder , trampling over our hearts , '' retorted Miss Oliver ."
"`` Susan , tell me -- do n't you ever -- did n't you ever -- take spells of feeling that you must scream -- or swear -- or smash something -- just because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable ? ''"
"`` I have never sworn or desired to swear , Miss Oliver dear , but I will admit , '' said Susan , with the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all , `` that I have experienced occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging . ''"
"`` Do n't you think that is a kind of swearing , Susan ?"
"What is the difference between slamming a door viciously and saying d -- '' `` Miss Oliver dear , '' interrupted Susan , desperately determined to save Gertrude from herself , if human power could do it , `` you are all tired out and unstrung -- and no wonder , teaching those obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news ."
But just you go upstairs and lie down and I will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will not want to slam doors or swear . ''
"`` Susan , you 're a good soul -- a very pearl of Susans !"
"But , Susan , it would be such a relief -- to say just one soft , low , little tiny d -- '' `` I will bring you a hot-water bottle for the soles of your feet , also , '' interposed Susan resolutely , `` and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of , Miss Oliver , and that you may tie to . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll try the hot-water bottle first , '' said Miss Oliver , repenting herself on teasing Susan and vanishing upstairs , to Susan 's intense relief ."
Susan shook her head ominously as she filled the hot-water bottle .
The war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour woefully .
Here was Miss Oliver admittedly on the point of profanity .
"`` We must draw the blood from her brain , '' said Susan , `` and if this bottle is not effective I will see what can be done with a mustard plaster . ''"
Gertrude rallied and carried on .
"Lord Kitchener went to Greece , whereat Susan foretold that Constantine would soon experience a change of heart ."
Lloyd George began to heckle the Allies regarding equipment and guns and Susan said you would hear more of Lloyd George yet .
"The gallant Anzacs withdrew from Gallipoli and Susan approved the step , with reservations ."
The siege of Kut-El-Amara began and Susan pored over maps of Mesopotamia and abused the Turks .
Henry Ford started for Europe and Susan flayed him with sarcasm .
"Sir John French was superseded by Sir Douglas Haig and Susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream , `` though , to be sure , Haig was a good name and French had a foreign sound , say what you might . ''"
"Not a move on the great chess-board of king or bishop or pawn escaped Susan , who had once read only Glen St. Mary notes ."
"`` There was a time , '' she said sorrowfully , `` when I did not care what happened outside of P.E. Island , and now a king can not have a toothache in Russia or China but it worries me ."
"It may be broadening to the mind , as the doctor said , but it is very painful to the feelings . ''"
When Christmas came again Susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board .
Two empty chairs were too much even for Susan who had thought in September that there would not be one .
"`` This is the first Christmas that Walter was not home , '' Rilla wrote in her diary that night ."
"`` Jem used to be away for Christmases up in Avonlea , but Walter never was ."
I had letters from Ken and him today .
They are still in England but expect to be in the trenches very soon .
And then -- but I suppose we 'll be able to endure it somehow .
"To me , the strangest of all the strange things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we could -- to go on with life as a matter of course ."
"At all events , though he told her grumpily that she had made a nice fool of herself , and would live to regret it , he said nothing worse , and Mrs. Joe put on her apron and went to work as usual , while Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who had a poor opinion of lighthouses for winter residences , went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox , a thankful dog that he was done with war-weddings ."
"CHAPTER XIX `` THEY SHALL NOT PASS '' One cold grey morning in February Gertrude Oliver wakened with a shiver , slipped into Rilla 's room , and crept in beside her ."
`` Rilla -- I 'm frightened -- frightened as a baby -- I 've had another of my strange dreams .
Something terrible is before us -- I know . ''
`` What was it ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` I was standing again on the veranda steps -- just as I stood in that dream on the night before the lighthouse dance , and in the sky a huge black , menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the east ."
I could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me I shivered with icy cold .
"Then the storm broke -- and it was a dreadful storm -- blinding flash after flash and deafening peal after peal , driving torrents of rain ."
"I turned in panic and tried to run for shelter , and as I did so a man -- a soldier in the uniform of a French army officer -- dashed up the steps and stood beside me on the threshold of the door ."
"His clothes were soaked with blood from a wound in his breast , he seemed spent and exhausted ; but his white face was set and his eyes blazed in his hollow face ."
"` They shall not pass , ' he said , in low , passionate tones which I heard distinctly amid all the turmoil of the storm ."
Then I awakened .
"Rilla , I 'm frightened -- the spring will not bring the Big Push we 've all been hoping for -- instead it is going to bring some dreadful blow to France ."
I am sure of it .
The Germans will try to smash through somewhere . ''
"`` But he told you that they would not pass , '' said Rilla , seriously ."
She never laughed at Gertrude 's dreams as the doctor did .
"`` I do not know if that was prophecy or desperation , Rilla , the horror of that dream holds me yet in an icy grip ."
We shall need all our courage before long . ''
"Dr. Blythe did laugh at the breakfast table -- but he never laughed at Miss Oliver 's dreams again ; for that day brought news of the opening of the Verdun offensive , and thereafter through all the beautiful weeks of spring the Ingleside family , one and all , lived in a trance of dread ."
There were days when they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the Germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate France .
"Susan 's deeds were in her spotless kitchen at Ingleside , but her thoughts were on the hills around Verdun ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she would stick her head in at Mrs. Blythe 's door the last thing at night to remark , `` I do hope the French have hung onto the Crow 's Wood today , '' and she woke at dawn to wonder if Dead Man 's Hill -- surely named by some prophet -- was still held by the `` poyloos . ''"
Susan could have drawn a map of the country around Verdun that would have satisfied a chief of staff .
"`` If the Germans capture Verdun the spirit of France will be broken , '' Miss Oliver said bitterly ."
"`` But they will not capture it , '' staunchly said Susan , who could not eat her dinner that day for fear lest they do that very thing ."
"`` In the first place , you dreamed they would not -- you dreamed the very thing the French are saying before they ever said it -- ` they shall not pass . '"
"I declare to you , Miss Oliver , dear , when I read that in the paper , and remembered your dream , I went cold all over with awe ."
It seemed to me like Biblical times when people dreamed things like that quite frequently .
"`` I know -- I know , '' said Gertrude , walking restlessly about ."
"`` I cling to a persistent faith in my dream , too -- but every time bad news comes it fails me ."
"In ten minutes , Mr. Bhaer and Silas were off to the wood , and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great pasture ."
"Mrs. Jo caught up some food from the table , a little bottle of brandy from the medicine-closet , took a lantern , and bidding Jack and Emil come with her , and the rest not stir , she trotted away on Toby , never stopping for hat or shawl ."
"She heard some one running after her , but said not a word till , as she paused to call and listen , the light of her lantern shone on Dan 's face ."
`` You here !
"I told Jack to come , '' she said , half-inclined to send him back , much as she needed help ."
"`` I would n't let him ; he and Emil had n't had any supper , and I wanted to come more than they did , '' he said , taking the lantern from her and smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her feel as if , boy though he was , she had some one to depend on ."
"Off she jumped , and ordered him on to Toby , in spite of his pleading to walk ; then they went on again along the dusty , solitary road , stopping every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to reply ."
"When they came to the great pasture , other lights were already flitting to and fro like will-o ' - the-wisps , and Mr. Bhaer 's voice was heard shouting , `` Nan !"
Rob !
Rob !
Nan ! ''
in every part of the field .
"Silas whistled and roared , Dan plunged here and there on Toby , who seemed to understand the case , and went over the roughest places with unusual docility ."
"Often Mrs. Jo hushed them all , saying , with a sob in her throat , `` The noise may frighten them , let me call ; Robby will know my voice ; '' and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone of tenderness , till the very echoes whispered it softly , and the winds seemed to waft it willingly ; but still no answer came ."
"The sky was overcast now , and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen , heat-lightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then , and a faint far-off rumble as of thunder told that a summer-storm was brewing ."
`` O my Robby !
my Robby ! ''
"mourned poor Mrs. Jo , wandering up and down like a pale ghost , while Dan kept beside her like a faithful fire-fly ."
`` What shall I say to Nan 's father if she comes to harm ?
Why did I ever trust my darling so far away ?
"Fritz , do you hear any thing ? ''"
"and when a mournful , `` No '' came back , she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan sprung down from Toby 's back , tied the bridle to the bars , and said , in his decided way , `` They may have gone down the spring I 'm going to look . ''"
"He was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him ; but when she reached the spot , he lowered the lantern and showed her with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring ."
"She fell down on her knees to examine the tracks , and then sprung up , saying eagerly , `` Yes ; that is the mark of my Robby 's little boots !"
"Come this way , they must have gone on . ''"
Such a weary search !
"But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead the anxious mother , for presently Dan uttered a cry , and caught up a little shining object lying in the path ."
"It was the cover of the new tin pail , dropped in the first alarm of being lost ."
"Mrs. Jo hugged and kissed it as if it were a living thing ; and when Dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot , she stopped him , saying , as she hurried on , `` No , let me find them ; I let Rob go , and I want to give him back to his father all myself . ''"
"A little farther on Nan 's hat appeared , and after passing the place more than once , they came at last upon the babes in the wood , both sound asleep ."
Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his lantern shone that night .
"He thought Mrs. Jo would cry out , but she only whispered , `` Hush ! ''"
asked Jose .
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call the little fish whose life you saved , and she will bring it to you . '"
"So he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones , and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring , and brought it to Jose in its mouth ."
"Well pleased with all he had done , Jose returned to the palace ; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor , she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil . '"
"I am very sorry , ' said the king to Jose , ' I really would rather not ; but you see I have no choice . '"
"While the oil was being heated in the great caldron , Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape ."
"` Do not be frightened , ' said the horse ."
"` Get on my back , and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . '"
"Jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil ."
He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough .
"Then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and Bella-Flor most of all ."
"As for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of Jose ."
"Then Jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day ."
"But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ` It is to you that I owe my life and my crown ."
Why have you done all this for me ? '
And the horse answered : ' I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune .
"And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you , as you had helped me ."
"For , as I told you , Good deeds bear their own fruit ! '"
"The Bird of Truth -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones , y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which , shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns , flowed quietly past trees and under bushes , listening to the songs of the birds overhead ."
"One day , when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets , he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal ."
Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet .
"Inside , lying on a soft bed of cotton , were two babies , a boy and a girl , who opened their eyes and smiled at him ."
"The man was filled with pity at the sight , and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife ."
The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle .
"` Are not eight children enough , ' she cried , ` without bringing us two more ?"
How do you think we can feed them ? '
"` You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger , ' answered he , ` or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea ?"
What is enough for eight is also enough for ten . '
The wife said no more ; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures .
"Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut , and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that , in time , their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own , who were quarrelsome and envious ."
"It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them , and were always playing tricks on them , so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river ."
"The fight lasted all day , and the prince 's strength was well-nigh spent , when the dragon , thinking that the victory was won , opened his jaws to give a roar of triumph ."
"The prince saw his chance , and before his foe could shut his mouth again had plunged his sword far down his adversary 's throat ."
"There was a desperate clutching of the claws to the earth , a slow flagging of the great wings , then the monster rolled over on his side and moved no more ."
Muffette was delivered .
After this they all went back to the palace .
"The marriage took place the following day , and Muffette and her husband lived happy for ever after ."
"The Adventures of Covan the Brown-Haired -LSB- From Les Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-"
"On the shores of the west , where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea , dwelt a goatherd and his wife , together with their three sons and one daughter ."
"All day long the young men fished and hunted , while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain , or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets ."
"For several years they all lived happily together , when one day , as the girl was out on the hill with the kids , the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping , creeping up from the sea ."
"She rose with a shiver , and tried to call to her kids , but the voice died away in her throat , and strong arms seemed to hold her ."
Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not .
"Many times the father and brothers jumped up , thinking they heard her steps , but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands , nor could they tell where the river lay , nor where the mountain ."
"One by one the kids came home , and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door , but no sound broke the stillness ."
"Through the night no one slept , and when morning broke and the mist rolled back , they sought the maiden by sea and by land , but never a trace of her could be found anywhere ."
"Thus a year and a day slipped by , and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old ."
"Their sons too were sadder than before , for they loved their sister well , and had never ceased to mourn for her ."
"At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said : ` It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us , and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return ."
"Surely some evil has befallen her , or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest ; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till , living or dead , I have found her . '"
"` If you have vowed , then must you keep your vow , ' answered Gorla ."
` But better had it been if you had first asked your father 's leave before you made it .
"Yet , since it is so , your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey ."
Who can tell how long it may be ? '
"So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two , a big one and a little one ."
"` Choose , my son , ' said she ."
"` Will you have the little cake with your mother 's blessing , or the big one without it , in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow ? ' '"
"I will have the large cake , ' answered the youth ; ` for what good would my mother 's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger ? '"
And taking the big cake he went his way .
"Straight on he strode , letting neither hill nor river hinder him ."
Swiftly he walked -- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain .
"The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed , leaving the deer behind him ; but at length he stopped , for hunger had seized on him , and he could walk no more ."
Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake .
`` Wo n't it cost a great deal ? ''
"asked Merry , who , in spite of her little elegancies , had a good deal of her thrifty mother 's common sense ."
`` Yes ; and I 've got to earn it .
"But I can -- I know I can , for I 've saved some , and I shall work like ten beavers all summer ."
"I wo n't borrow if I can help it , but I know someone who would lend me five hundred if I wanted it ; '' and Ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks ."
`` I wish I had it to give you .
It must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance .
"And to travel , and see all the lovely pictures and statues , and people and places in Italy ."
How happy you must be ! ''
and Merry 's eyes had the wistful look they always wore when she dreamed dreams of the world she loved to live in .
`` I am -- so happy that I 'm afraid it never will happen .
"If I do go , I 'll write and tell you all about the fine sights , and how I get on ."
Would you like me to ? ''
"asked Ralph , beginning enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully , for he admired Merry very much , and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received ."
`` Indeed I should !
"I 'd feel so grand to have letters from Paris and Rome , and you 'd have so much to tell it would be almost as good as going myself , '' she said , looking off into the daffodil sky , as they paused a minute on the hill-top to get breath , for both had walked as fast as they talked ."
`` And will you answer the letters ? ''
"asked Ralph , watching the innocent face , which looked unusually kind and beautiful to him in that soft light ."
"`` Why , yes ; I 'd love to , only I shall not have anything interesting to say ."
What can I write about ? ''
and Merry smiled as she thought how dull her letters would sound after the exciting details his would doubtless give .
"`` Write about yourself , and all the rest of the people I know ."
"Grandma will be gone , and I shall want to hear how you get on . ''"
"Ralph looked very anxious indeed to hear , and Merry promised she would tell all about the other people , adding , as she turned from the evening peace and loveliness to the house , whence came the clatter of milk-pans and the smell of cooking , -- `` I never should have anything very nice to tell about myself , for I do n't do interesting things as you do , and you would n't care to hear about school , and sewing , and messing round at home . ''"
"Merry gave a disdainful little sniff at the savory perfume of ham which saluted them , and paused with her hand on the gate , as if she found it pleasanter out there than in the house ."
"Ralph seemed to agree with her , for , leaning on the gate , he lingered to say , with real sympathy in his tone and something else in his face , `` Yes , I should ; so you write and tell me all about it ."
"I did n't know you had any worries , for you always seemed like one of the happiest people in the world , with so many to pet and care for you , and plenty of money , and nothing very hard or hateful to do ."
"You 'd think you were well off if you knew as much about poverty and work and never getting what you want , as I do . ''"
`` You bear your worries so well that nobody knows you have them .
"I ought not to complain , and I wo n't , for I do have all I need ."
"I 'm so glad you are going to get what you want at last ; '' and Merry held out her hand to say good-night , with so much pleasure in her face that Ralph could not make up his mind to go just yet ."
"`` I shall have to scratch round in a lively way before I do get it , for David says a fellow ca n't live on less than four or five hundred a year , even living as poor artists have to , in garrets and on crusts ."
"`` Troth , no ! ''"
"And he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself , recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman ."
"James carried me accordingly into the kitchen , and sat down with me at table , smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner ."
"But presently the gloom returned upon him ; he sat frowning and biting his fingers ; only remembered me from time to time ; and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile , and back into his private terrors ."
"His wife sat by the fire and wept , with her face in her hands ; his eldest son was crouched upon the floor , running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end ; all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room , in a blind hurry of fear , and whimpering as she went ; and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard , and cry for orders ."
"At last James could keep his seat no longer , and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about ."
"`` I am but poor company altogether , sir , '' says he , `` but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident , and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons . ''"
A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept ; and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness .
He struck the lad repeatedly .
`` Are you gone gyte ? ''
* he cried .
`` Do you wish to hang your father ? ''
"and forgetful of my presence , carried on at him a long time together in the Gaelic , the young man answering nothing ; only the wife , at the name of hanging , throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before ."
* Mad .
"This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see ; and I was right glad when Alan returned , looking like himself in his fine French clothes , though -LRB- to be sure -RRB- they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine ."
"I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons , and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need , and a pair of Highland brogues made of deer-leather , rather strange at first , but after a little practice very easy to the feet ."
"By the time I came back Alan must have told his story ; for it seemed understood that I was to fly with him , and they were all busy upon our equipment ."
"They gave us each a sword and pistols , though I professed my inability to use the former ; and with these , and some ammunition , a bag of oatmeal , an iron pan , and a bottle of right French brandy , we were ready for the heather ."
"Money , indeed , was lacking ."
"I had about two guineas left ; Alan 's belt having been despatched by another hand , that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune ; and as for James , it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants , that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny , the most of it in coppers ."
"`` This 'll no do , '' said Alan ."
"`` Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by , '' said James , `` and get word sent to me ."
"Ye see , ye 'll have to get this business prettily off , Alan ."
This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two .
"They 're sure to get wind of ye , sure to seek ye , and by my way of it , sure to lay on ye the wyte of this day 's accident ."
"If it falls on you , it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country ."
"And if it comes on me -- '' he paused , and bit his fingers , with a white face ."
"`` It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang , '' said he ."
"`` It would be an ill day for Appin , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a day that sticks in my throat , '' said James ."
"`` O man , man , man -- man Alan !"
you and me have spoken like two fools ! ''
"It comes -- we may say -- he was your true companion ; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit , for I dare say you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows ."
"Well , well , these days are fortunately by ; and I think -LRB- speaking humanly -RRB- that you are near the end of your troubles . ''"
"As he thus moralised on my adventures , he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction ."
"I had been so long wandering with lawless people , and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky , that to sit once more in a clean , covered house , and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth , seemed mighty elevations ."
"Even as I thought so , my eye fell on my unseemly tatters , and I was once more plunged in confusion ."
But the lawyer saw and understood me .
"He rose , called over the stair to lay another plate , for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner , and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house ."
"Here he set before me water and soap , and a comb ; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son ; and here , with another apposite tag , he left me to my toilet ."
"CHAPTER XXVIII I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE I made what change I could in my appearance ; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past , and David Balfour come to life again ."
"And yet I was ashamed of the change too , and , above all , of the borrowed clothes ."
"When I had done , Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair , made me his compliments , and had me again into the cabinet ."
"`` Sit ye down , Mr. David , '' said he , `` and now that you are looking a little more like yourself , let me see if I can find you any news ."
"You will be wondering , no doubt , about your father and your uncle ?"
To be sure it is a singular tale ; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you .
"For , '' says he , really with embarrassment , `` the matter hinges on a love affair . ''"
"`` Truly , '' said I , `` I can not very well join that notion with my uncle . ''"
"`` But your uncle , Mr. David , was not always old , '' replied the lawyer , `` and what may perhaps surprise you more , not always ugly ."
"He had a fine , gallant air ; people stood in their doors to look after him , as he went by upon a mettle horse ."
"I have seen it with these eyes , and I ingenuously confess , not altogether without envy ; for I was a plain lad myself and a plain man 's son ; and in those days it was a case of Odi te , qui bellus es , Sabelle . ''"
"`` It sounds like a dream , '' said I. `` Ay , ay , '' said the lawyer , `` that is how it is with youth and age ."
"Nor was that all , but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future ."
"In 1715 , what must he do but run away to join the rebels ?"
"It was your father that pursued him , found him in a ditch , and brought him back multum gementem ; to the mirth of the whole country ."
"However , majora canamus -- the two lads fell in love , and that with the same lady ."
"Mr. Ebenezer , who was the admired and the beloved , and the spoiled one , made , no doubt , mighty certain of the victory ; and when he found he had deceived himself , screamed like a peacock ."
"The whole country heard of it ; now he lay sick at home , with his silly family standing round the bed in tears ; now he rode from public-house to public-house , and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom , Dick , and Harry ."
"Your father , Mr. David , was a kind gentleman ; but he was weak , dolefully weak ; took all this folly with a long countenance ; and one day -- by your leave !"
-- resigned the lady .
"She was no such fool , however ; it 's from her you must inherit your excellent good sense ; and she refused to be bandied from one to another ."
Both got upon their knees to her ; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door .
That was in August ; dear me !
the same year I came from college .
"`` Well , I reckon it 's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , '' he replied ; `` so it 's strong , and plenty of it , what 's the odds ? ''"
"`` All right , '' I answered ."
"`` I 'll bring you port , Mr. Hands ."
But I 'll have to dig for it . ''
"With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion ."
"I knew he would not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true ."
"He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved -- for I could hear him stifle a groan -- yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck ."
"In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood ."
"He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark ."
This was all that I required to know .
"Israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that I was meant to be the victim ."
"What he would do afterwards -- whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him -- was , of course , more than I could say ."
"Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner ."
"We both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared ."
"While I was thus turning the business over in my mind , I had not been idle with my body ."
"I had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , I made my reappearance on the deck ."
"Hands lay as I had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light ."
"He looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of `` Here 's luck ! ''"
"Then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid ."
"`` Cut me a junk o ' that , '' says he , `` for I have n't no knife and hardly strength enough , so be as I had ."
"Ah , Jim , Jim , I reckon I 've missed stays !"
"Cut me a quid , as 'll likely be the last , lad , for I 'm for my long home , and no mistake . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 'll cut you some tobacco , but if I was you and thought myself so badly , I would go to my prayers like a Christian man . ''"
`` Why ? ''
said he .
"`` Now , you tell me why . ''"
`` Why ? ''
I cried .
`` You were asking me just now about the dead .
"You 've broken your trust ; you 've lived in sin and lies and blood ; there 's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment , and you ask me why !"
"For God 's mercy , Mr. Hands , that 's why . ''"
"I spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with ."
A ` phone message has just come through from Charlottetown that Woodrow Wilson has sent that German ambassador man to the right about at last .
They tell me that means war .
"So I begin to think that Woodrow 's heart is in the right place after all , wherever his head may be , and I am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion with some fudge , despite the howls of the Food Board ."
I thought that submarine business would bring things to a crisis .
I told Cousin Sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the end for the Allies . ''
"`` Do n't let the doctor hear of the fudge , Susan , '' said Anne , with a smile ."
`` You know he has laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for . ''
"`` Yes , Mrs. Dr. dear , and a man should be master in his own household , and his women folk should bow to his decrees ."
I flatter myself that I am becoming quite efficient in economizing '' -- Susan had taken to using certain German terms with killing effect -- `` but one can exercise a little gumption on the quiet now and then .
"Shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other day -- the Susan brand , as he called it -- and I said ` The first victory there is to celebrate I shall make you some . '"
"I consider this news quite equal to a victory , and what the doctor does not know will never grieve him ."
"I take the whole responsibility , Mrs. Dr. dear , so do not you vex your conscience . ''"
Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter .
"He came home from Queen 's every week-end , and Susan had all his favourite dishes for him , in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor , and waited on him hand and foot ."
"Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him , but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse ; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued , Susan 's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed ."
Surely the end was in sight -- would come now before -- anyone else -- could go .
`` Things are coming our way at last .
"We have got the Germans on the run , '' she boasted ."
"`` The United States has declared war at last , as I always believed they would , in spite of Woodrow 's gift for letter writing , and you will see they will go into it with a vim since I understand that is their habit , when they do start ."
"And we have got the Germans on the run , too . ''"
"`` The States mean well , '' moaned Cousin Sophia , `` but all the vim in the world can not put them on the fighting line this spring , and the Allies will be finished before that ."
The Germans are just luring them on .
That man Simonds says their retreat has put the Allies in a hole . ''
"`` That man Simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good , '' retorted Susan ."
`` I do not worry myself about his opinion as long as Lloyd George is Premier of England .
He will not be bamboozled and that you may tie to .
Things look good to me .
"The U. S. is in the war , and we have got Kut and Bagdad back -- and I would not be surprised to see the Allies in Berlin by June -- and the Russians , too , since they have got rid of the Czar ."
"That , in my opinion was a good piece of work . ''"
"`` Time will show if it is , '' said Cousin Sophia , who would have been very indignant if anyone had told her that she would rather see Susan put to shame as a seer , than a successful overthrow of tyranny , or even the march of the Allies down Unter den Linden ."
"But then the woes of the Russian people were quite unknown to Cousin Sophia , while this aggravating , optimistic Susan was an ever-present thorn in her side ."
"Just at that moment Shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the living-room , swinging his legs -- a brown , ruddy , wholesome lad , from top to toe , every inch of him -- and saying coolly , `` Mother and dad , I was eighteen last Monday ."
"Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation ; ten men , it was decided between them , should be reserved , not only to garrison the Moat House , but to escort the priest across the wood ."
"In the meantime , as Bennet was to remain behind , the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton ."
"Indeed , there was no choice ; the men were loutish fellows , dull and unskilled in war , while Dick was not only popular , but resolute and grave beyond his age ."
"Although his youth had been spent in these rough , country places , the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver , and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command ."
"Bennet had always been kind and helpful ; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies , but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends ; and now , while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write , in his swift , exquisite penmanship , a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master , Sir Daniel Brackley , Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise ."
"`` Ye must go the long way about , Master Shelton , '' he said ; `` round by the bridge , for your life !"
"Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you , to draw shots ; and go softly till y ' are past the wood ."
"If the rogues fall upon you , ride for ` t ; ye will do naught by standing ."
"And keep ever forward , Master Shelton ; turn me not back again , an ye love your life ; there is no help in Tunstall , mind ye that ."
"And now , since ye go to the great wars about the king , and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life , and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below , I give you my last counsels now at your riding ."
Keep an eye on Sir Daniel ; he is unsure .
"Put not your trust in the jack-priest ; he intendeth not amiss , but doth the will of others ; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel !"
Get your good lordship where ye go ; make you strong friends ; look to it .
And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch .
There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet .
"So , God-speed ! ''"
"`` And Heaven be with you , Bennet ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Ye were a good friend to me-ward , and so I shall say ever . ''"
"`` And , look ye , master , '' added Hatch , with a certain embarrassment , `` if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me , ye might , mayhap , lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul ; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory . ''"
"`` Ye shall have your will of it , Bennet , '' answered Dick ."
"`` But , what cheer , man !"
"we shall meet again , where ye shall have more need of ale than masses . ''"
"`` The saints so grant it , Master Dick ! ''"
returned the other .
`` But here comes Sir Oliver .
"An he were as quick with the long-bow as with the pen , he would be a brave man-at-arms . ''"
"Sir Oliver gave Dick a sealed packet , with this superscription : `` To my ryght worchypful master , Sir Daniel Brackley , knyght , be thys delyvered in haste . ''"
"And Dick , putting it in the bosom of his jacket , gave the word and set forth westward up the village ."
"BOOK I -- THE TWO LADS CHAPTER I -- AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night , warmly quartered and well patrolled ."
"But the Knight of Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting ; and even now , when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him , he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours ."
"He was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances ; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant , and then , by the favour he curried with great lords about the king , procure unjust decisions in his favour ; or , if that was too roundabout , to seize the disputed manor by force of arms , and rely on his influence and Sir Oliver 's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched ."
"By good luck , his knife flew out of his hand as he fell ."
"I picked up both that and his brogues , wished him a good morning , and set off upon my way , leaving him barefoot and disarmed ."
"I chuckled to myself as I went , being sure I was done with that rogue , for a variety of reasons ."
"First , he knew he could have no more of my money ; next , the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence ; and , lastly , the knife , which was really a dagger , it was against the law for him to carry ."
"In about half an hour of walk , I overtook a great , ragged man , moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff ."
"He was quite blind , and told me he was a catechist , which should have put me at my ease ."
"But his face went against me ; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret ; and presently , as we began to go on alongside , I saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket ."
"To carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence , and transportation to the colonies upon a second ."
"Nor could I quite see why a religious teacher should go armed , or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol ."
"I told him about my guide , for I was proud of what I had done , and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence ."
"At the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two , and was glad he could not see my blushes ."
`` Was it too much ? ''
"I asked , a little faltering ."
`` Too much ! ''
cries he .
"`` Why , I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram of brandy ."
And give you the great pleasure of my company -LRB- me that is a man of some learning -RRB- in the bargain . ''
"I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide ; but at that he laughed aloud , and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle ."
"`` In the Isle of Mull , at least , '' says he , `` where I know every stone and heather-bush by mark of head ."
"See , now , '' he said , striking right and left , as if to make sure , `` down there a burn is running ; and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that ; and it 's hard at the foot of the hill , that the way runs by to Torosay ; and the way here , being for droves , is plainly trodden , and will show grassy through the heather . ''"
"I had to own he was right in every feature , and told my wonder ."
`` Ha ! ''
"says he , `` that 's nothing ."
"Would ye believe me now , that before the Act came out , and when there were weepons in this country , I could shoot ?"
"Ay , could I ! ''"
"cries he , and then with a leer : `` If ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with , I would show ye how it 's done . ''"
"I told him I had nothing of the sort , and gave him a wider berth ."
"If he had known , his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket , and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt ."
"But by the better luck for me , he knew nothing , thought all was covered , and lied on in the dark ."
"He then began to question me cunningly , where I came from , whether I was rich , whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him -LRB- which he declared he had that moment in his sporran -RRB- , and all the time he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him ."
"We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay , and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel ."
"I had so plainly the upper-hand that my spirits rose , and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman 's buff ; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier , and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff ."
But we must take a brace and see it through . ''
All Rilla 's anger against Susan had evaporated .
"With Ken 's kiss still burning on her lips , and the wonderful significance of the promise he had asked thrilling heart and soul , she could not be angry with anyone ."
"She put her slim white hand into Susan 's brown , work-hardened one and gave it a squeeze ."
Susan was a faithful old dear and would lay down her life for any one of them .
"`` You are tired , Rilla dear , and had better go to bed , '' Susan said , patting her hand ."
`` I noticed you were too tired to talk tonight .
I am glad I came home in time to help you out .
It is very tiresome trying to entertain young men when you are not accustomed to it . ''
"Rilla carried Jims upstairs and went to bed , but not before she had sat for a long time at her window reconstructing her rainbow castle , with several added domes and turrets ."
"`` I wonder , '' she said to herself , `` if I am , or am not , engaged to Kenneth Ford . ''"
"CHAPTER XVII THE WEEKS WEAR BY Rilla read her first love letter in her Rainbow Valley fir-shadowed nook , and a girl 's first love letter , whatever blase , older people may think of it , is an event of tremendous importance in the teens ."
"After Kenneth 's regiment had left Kingsport there came a fortnight of dully-aching anxiety and when the congregation sang in Church on Sunday evenings , `` Oh , hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea , '' Rilla 's voice always failed her ; for with the words came a horribly vivid mind picture of a submarined ship sinking beneath pitiless waves amid the struggles and cries of drowning men ."
"Then word came that Kenneth 's regiment had arrived safely in England ; and now , at last , here was his letter ."
It began with something that made Rilla supremely happy for the moment and ended with a paragraph that crimsoned her cheeks with the wonder and thrill and delight of it .
"Between beginning and ending the letter was just such a jolly , newsy epistle as Ken might have written to anyone ; but for the sake of that beginning and ending Rilla slept with the letter under her pillow for weeks , sometimes waking in the night to slip her fingers under and just touch it , and looked with secret pity on other girls whose sweethearts could never have written them anything half so wonderful and exquisite ."
Kenneth was not the son of a famous novelist for nothing .
"He `` had a way '' of expressing things in a few poignant , significant words that seemed to suggest far more than they uttered , and never grew stale or flat or foolish with ever so many scores of readings ."
Rilla went home from Rainbow Valley as if she flew rather than walked .
But such moments of uplift were rare that autumn .
"To be sure , there was one day in September when great news came of a big Allied victory in the west and Susan ran out to hoist the flag -- the first time she had hoisted it since the Russian line broke and the last time she was to hoist it for many dismal moons ."
"`` Likely the Big Push has begun at last , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she exclaimed , `` and we will soon see the finish of the Huns ."
Our boys will be home by Christmas now .
Hurrah ! ''
"Susan was ashamed of herself for hurrahing the minute she had done it , and apologized meekly for such an outburst of juvenility ."
"`` But indeed , Mrs. Dr. dear , this good news has gone to my head after this awful summer of Russian slumps and Gallipoli setbacks . ''"
`` Good news ! ''
said Miss Oliver bitterly .
`` I wonder if the women whose men have been killed for it will call it good news .
Just because our own men are not on that part of the front we are rejoicing as if the victory had cost no lives . ''
"`` Now , Miss Oliver dear , do not take that view of it , '' deprecated Susan ."
`` We have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same .
"`` Quite lost , but I did not care , for I made up my mind that it would be best to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again ; and you see I have waited , '' said Mrs. Jo , beginning to pull in the big kite , for it was getting late ."
`` Must we go now ? ''
"`` I must , or you wo n't have any supper ; and that sort of surprise party would not suit you , I think , my chickens . ''"
`` Has n't our party been a nice one ? ''
"asked Tommy , complacently ."
`` Splendid ! ''
answered every one .
`` Do you know why ?
"It is because your guests have behaved themselves , and tried to make everything go well ."
"You understand what I mean , do n't you ? ''"
"`` Yes 'm , '' was all the boys said , but they stole a shamefaced look at one another , as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home , thinking of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves , and things had gone badly on account of it ."
"CHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN July had come , and haying begun ; the little gardens were doing finely and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours ."
"The house stood open from morning till night , and the lads lived out of doors , except at school time ."
"The lessons were short , and there were many holidays , for the Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise , and our short summers are best used in out-of-door work ."
"Such a rosy , sunburnt , hearty set as the boys became ; such appetites as they had ; such sturdy arms and legs , as outgrew jackets and trousers ; such laughing and racing all over the place ; such antics in house and barn ; such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale ; and such satisfaction in the hearts of the worthy Bhaers , as they saw their flock prospering in mind and body , I can not begin to describe ."
"Only one thing was needed to make them quite happy , and it came when they least expected it ."
"One balmy night when the little lads were in bed , the elder ones bathing down at the brook , and Mrs. Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor , he suddenly cried out , `` Oh , my Danny ! ''"
"and pointed to the window , where the moon shone brightly ."
"`` No , lovey , he is not there , it was the pretty moon , '' said his mother ."
"`` No , no , Danny at a window ; Teddy saw him , '' persisted baby , much excited ."
"`` It might have been , '' and Mrs. Bhaer hurried to the window , hoping it would prove true ."
"But the face was gone , and nowhere appeared any signs of a mortal boy ; she called his name , ran to the front door with Teddy in his little shirt , and made him call too , thinking the baby voice might have more effect than her own ."
"No one answered , nothing appeared , and they went back much disappointed ."
"Teddy would not be satisfied with the moon , and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask if Danny was not `` tummin ' soon . ''"
"By and by he fell asleep , the lads trooped up to bed , the house grew still , and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night ."
"Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing , for the big basket was always piled with socks , full of portentous holes , and thinking of the lost boy ."
"She had decided that baby had been mistaken , and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child 's fancy , for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed , and he was busy writing letters ."
It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house .
"As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps , something white caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn ."
"The children had been playing there all the afternoon , and , fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual , Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it ."
"But as she approached , she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief , but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it ."
"She hurried round the hay-cock , and there lay Dan , fast asleep ."
The scene must have been highly farcical . ''
"I thought myself it was a silly business , but I could not forget my father had a hand in it ."
"`` Surely , sir , it had some note of tragedy , '' said I. `` Why , no , sir , not at all , '' returned the lawyer ."
"`` For tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute , some dignus vindice nodus ; and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled , and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted ."
"However , that was not your father 's view ; and the end of it was , that from concession to concession on your father 's part , and from one height to another of squalling , sentimental selfishness upon your uncle 's , they came at last to drive a sort of bargain , from whose ill results you have recently been smarting ."
"The one man took the lady , the other the estate ."
"Now , Mr. David , they talk a great deal of charity and generosity ; but in this disputable state of life , I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer , and takes all the law allows him ."
"Anyhow , this piece of Quixotry on your father 's part , as it was unjust in itself , has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices ."
"Your father and mother lived and died poor folk ; you were poorly reared ; and in the meanwhile , what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws !"
And I might add -LRB- if it was a matter I cared much about -RRB- what a time for Mr. Ebenezer ! ''
"`` And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all , '' said I , `` that a man 's nature should thus change . ''"
"`` True , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
`` And yet I imagine it was natural enough .
He could not think that he had played a handsome part .
"Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder ; those who knew it not , seeing one brother disappear , and the other succeed in the estate , raised a cry of murder ; so that upon all sides he found himself evited ."
"Money was all he got by his bargain ; well , he came to think the more of money ."
"He was selfish when he was young , he is selfish now that he is old ; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself . ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` and in all this , what is my position ? ''"
"`` The estate is yours beyond a doubt , '' replied the lawyer ."
"`` It matters nothing what your father signed , you are the heir of entail ."
But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible ; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question .
"A lawsuit is always expensive , and a family lawsuit always scandalous ; besides which , if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out , we might find that we had burned our fingers ."
"The kidnapping , to be sure , would be a court card upon our side , if we could only prove it ."
"But it may be difficult to prove ; and my advice -LRB- upon the whole -RRB- is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle , perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century , and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision . ''"
"I told him I was very willing to be easy , and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse ."
In the meantime -LRB- thinking to myself -RRB- I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted .
"`` The great affair , '' I asked , `` is to bring home to him the kidnapping ? ''"
"`` Surely , '' said Mr. Rankeillor , `` and if possible , out of court ."
"For mark you here , Mr. David : we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who would swear to your reclusion ; but once they were in the box , we could no longer check their testimony , and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out ."
Which -LRB- from what you have let fall -RRB- I can not think to be desirable . ''
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` here is my way of it . ''"
And I opened my plot to him .
"Jill had been winding wool for a stripe in her new afghan , and the green ball lay on her sofa ."
"These signs suggested and confirmed what Mrs. Minot did not want to believe ; so did the voice , attitude , and air of Jill , all very unlike her usual open , alert ways ."
"The kind lady could easily forgive the reading of her letter since the girl had found such sad news there , but the dangers of disobedience were serious in her case , and a glance showed that she was suffering either in mind or body -- perhaps both ."
`` I will wait for her to tell me .
"She is an honest child , and the truth will soon come out , '' thought Mrs. Minot , as she took a clean sheet , and Jill tried to study ."
"`` Shall I hear your lesson , dear ?"
"Jack means to recite his like a good boy , so suppose you follow his example , '' she said , presently ."
"`` I do n't know as I can say it , but I 'll try . ''"
"Jill did try , and got on bravely till she came to the word `` permanent ; '' there she hesitated , remembering where she saw it last ."
`` Do you know what that means ? ''
"asked her teacher , thinking to help her on by defining the word ."
`` Always -- for a great while -- or something like that ; does n't it ? ''
"faltered Jill , with a tight feeling in her throat , and the color coming up , as she tried to speak easily , yet felt so shame-stricken she could not ."
"`` Are you in pain , my child ?"
"Never mind the lesson ; tell me , and I 'll do something for you . ''"
"The kind words , the soft hand on her hot cheek , and the pity in the eyes that looked at her , were too much for Jill ."
"A sob came first , and then the truth , told with hidden face and tears that washed the blush away , and set free the honest little soul that could not hide its fault from such a friend ."
"`` I knew it all before , and was sure you would tell me , else you would not be the child I love and like to help so well . ''"
"Then , while she soothed Jill 's trouble , Mrs. Minot told her story and showed the letter , wishing to lessen , if possible , some part of the pain it had given ."
`` Sly old stamp !
"To go and tell on me when I meant to own up , and get some credit if I could , after being so mean and bad , '' said Jill , smiling through her tears when she saw the tell-tale witnesses against her ."
"`` You had better stick it in your book to remind you of the bad consequences of disobedience , then perhaps this lesson will leave a ` permanent ' impression on your mind and memory , '' answered Mrs. Minot , glad to see her natural gayety coming back , and hoping that she had forgotten the contents of the unfortunate letter ."
"But she had not ; and presently , when the sad affair had been talked over and forgiven , Jill asked , slowly , as she tried to put on a brave look , -- `` Please tell me about Lucinda Snow ."
"If I am to be like her , I might as well know how she managed to bear it so long . ''"
"`` I 'm sorry you ever heard of her , and yet perhaps it may help you to bear your trial , dear , which I hope will never be as heavy a one as hers ."
"This Lucinda I knew for years , and though at first I thought her fate the saddest that could be , I came at last to see how happy she was in spite of her affliction , how good and useful and beloved . ''"
"`` Why , how could she be ?"
What did she do ? ''
"cried Jill , forgetting her own troubles to look up with an open , eager face again ."
"`` She was so patient , other people were ashamed to complain of their small worries ; so cheerful , that her own great one grew lighter ; so industrious , that she made both money and friends by pretty things she worked and sold to her many visitors ."
"And , best of all , so wise and sweet that she seemed to get good out of everything , and make her poor room a sort of chapel where people went for comfort , counsel , and an example of a pious life ."
"So , you see , Lucinda was not so very miserable after all . ''"
"` Well , I was tired of stooping for the sticks , and was leaning against a tree to rest , when I heard a noise of ` sh - ` sh , among the dead leaves ."
"I thought perhaps it was a wolf , so I stood very still ."
But soon there came past a tall man -- oh !
"twice as tall as father -- with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle , from which hung a silver-handled knife ."
"Behind him followed a great dog , which looked stronger than any wolf , or even a bear ."
"But why are you so pale , mother ? '"
"` It was the Stalo , ' replied she , her voice trembling ; ` Stalo the man-eater !"
"You did well to hide , or you might never had come back ."
"But , remember that , though he is so tall and strong , he is very stupid , and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick . '"
"Not long after the mother and son had held this talk , it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one , no one knew whither ."
"The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief , to show him where they had passed , but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well , near which the children used to play ."
"The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen , and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well , and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there ."
"And , as he watched , Patto 's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path , till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place ."
"She slipped and fell , and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo ."
"As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage , and he vowed to have his revenge ."
"So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung , and putting it on went out into the forest ."
"When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him , then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well , though he took care to keep his head out of the water ."
"Very soon he heard a ` sh - ` sh of the leaves , and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner ."
"At the first glimpse of Patto 's head in the well he laughed loudly , crying : ` Ha !"
ha !
This time it is the old ass !
I wonder how he will taste ? '
"And drawing Patto out of the well , he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home ."
"Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast , while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut , which he meant to hold Patto 's flesh when it was cooked ."
"In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors , and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool ."
"The young man looked everywhere , but he could not find the axe , for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes ."
` Stupid fellow !
what is the use of you ? '
"grumbled his father angrily ; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool , but they had no better success than their brother . '"
"I must come myself , I suppose ! '"
"said Stalo , putting aside the box ."
"But , meanwhile , Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door , so that , as Stalo stepped in , his prisoner raised the axe , and with one blow the ogre 's head was rolling on the ground ."
After that he lay down and slept soundly .
"The sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot ."
"The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup , just as the book had said there would be ."
"He lifted the syrup out with a spoon , and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry , poured it into a small flask of crystal ."
"He next washed himself thoroughly , and dressed himself , in his best clothes , and putting the flask in his pocket , set out for the palace , and begged to see the king without delay ."
"Now Balancin , whose foot had been much less painful since Gilguerillo had wrapped it in the plaster , was counting the days to the young man 's return ; and when he was told Gilguerillo was there , ordered him to be admitted at once ."
"As he entered , the king raised himself eagerly on his pillows , but his face fell when he saw no signs of a slipper ."
"` You have failed , then ? '"
"he said , throwing up his hands in despair . '"
"I hope not , your majesty ; I think not , ' answered the youth ."
"And drawing the flask from his pocket , he poured two or three drops on the wound ."
"` Repeat this for three nights , and you will find yourself cured , ' said he ."
And before the king had time to thank him he had bowed himself out .
"Of course the news soon spread through the city , and men and women never tired of calling Gilguerillo an impostor , and prophesying that the end of the three days would see him in prison , if not on the scaffold ."
"But Gilguerillo paid no heed to their hard words , and no more did the king , who took care that no hand but his own should put on the healing balsam ."
On the fourth morning the king awoke and instantly stretched out his wounded foot that he might prove the truth or falsehood of Gilguerillo 's remedy .
"The wound was certainly cured on that side , but how about the other ?"
"Yes , that was cured also ; and not even a scar was left to show where it had been !"
Was ever any king so happy as Balancin when he satisfied himself of this ?
"Lightly as a deer he jumped from his bed , and began to turn head over heels and to perform all sorts of antics , so as to make sure that his foot was in truth as well as it looked ."
"And when he was quite tired he sent for his daughter , and bade the courtiers bring the lucky young man to his room ."
"` He is really young and handsome , ' said the princess to herself , heaving a sigh of relief that it was not some dreadful old man who had healed her father ; and while the king was announcing to his courtiers the wonderful cure that had been made , Diamantina was thinking that if Gilguerillo looked so well in his common dress , how much improved by the splendid garments of a king ' son ."
"However , she held her peace , and only watched with amusement when the courtiers , knowing there was no help for it , did homage and obeisance to the chemist 's boy ."
"Then they brought to Gilguerillo a magnificent tunic of green velvet bordered with gold , and a cap with three white plumes stuck in it ; and at the sight of him so arrayed , the princess fell in love with him in a moment ."
"The wedding was fixed to take place in eight days , and at the ball afterwards nobody danced so long or so lightly as king Balancin ."

-LSB- From AEventyr fra Zylland samlede og optegnede af Tang Kristensen .
Translated from the Danish by Mrs. Skavgaard-Pedersen . -RSB-
There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans .
From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship .
"So , one fine summer morning , he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back ."
"For many hours he trudged on merrily , now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree ."
`` Do n't quarrel about me .
"I shall do well enough , and the scarlet shawl will hide my ugly dress , '' said Merry , from the corner , where she sat waiting for her turn at the mirror ."
"As she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it , and something that she saw in the other room put her own disappointment out of her head ."
"Jill lay there all alone , rather tired with the lively chatter , and the effort it cost her not to repine at being shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting ."
"Her eyes were closed , her net was off , and all the pretty black curls lay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out , while the other rested on the red shawl , as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture ."
"She was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon , and something in the plaintive voice , the solitary figure , went straight to Merry 's gentle heart ."
"`` Poor Jilly ca n't have any of the fun , '' was the first thought ; then came a second , that made Merry start and smile , and in a minute whisper so that all but Jill could hear her , `` Girls , I 'm not going to be the Princess ."
But I 've thought of a splendid one ! ''
`` Who ? ''
"asked the rest , staring at one another , much surprised by this sudden announcement ."
`` Hush !
"Speak low , or you will spoil it all ."
"Look in the Bird Room , and tell me if that is n't a prettier Princess than I could make ? ''"
"They all looked , but no one spoke , and Merry added , with sweet eagerness , `` It is the only thing poor Jill can be , and it would make her so happy ; Jack would like it , and it would please every one , I know ."
"Perhaps she will never walk again , so we ought to be very good to her , poor dear . ''"
"The last words , whispered with a little quiver in the voice , settled the matter better than hours of talking , for girls are tender-hearted creatures , and not one of these but would have gladly given all the pretty things she owned to see Jill dancing about well and strong again ."
"Like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched and brightened every face ; envy , impatience , vanity , and discontent flew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy , and with one accord they all cried , -- `` It will be lovely ; let us go and tell her ! ''"
"Forgetting their own adornment , out they trooped after Merry , who ran to the sofa , saying , with a smile which was reflected in all the other faces , `` Jill , dear , we have chosen another Princess , and I know you 'll like her . ''"
`` Who is it ? ''
"asked Jill , languidly , opening her eyes without the least suspicion of the truth ."
"`` I 'll show you ; '' and taking the cherished veil from her own head , Merry dropped it like a soft cloud over Jill ; Annette added the long plume , Susy laid the white silk dress about her , while Juliet and Mabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa , and Molly tore the last ornament from her turban , a silver star , to shine on Jill 's breast ."
"Then they all took hands and danced round the couch , singing , as they laughed at her astonishment , `` There she is !"
There she is !
Princess Jill as fine as you please !
`` Do you really mean it ?
But can I ?
Is it fair ?
How sweet of you !
Come here and let me hug you all ! ''
"cried Jill , in a rapture at the surprise , and the pretty way in which it was done ."
"The grand scene on the Twenty-second was very fine , indeed ; but the little tableau of that minute was infinitely better , though no one saw it , as Jill tried to gather them all in her arms , for that nosegay of girlish faces was the sweeter , because each one had sacrificed her own little vanity to please a friend , and her joy was reflected in the eyes that sparkled round the happy Princess ."
"`` Oh , you dear , kind things , to think of me and give me all your best clothes !"
"The other boys were flying around him now , flouting , scornful ; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently , his mind was no longer with them ; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago , or being sent up -LSB- to the headmaster -RSB- for good , or watching the wall-game from a famous wall ."
"And his shoes were right , and his waistcoat was right , and his tie was right , and his socks were right ."
"James Hook , thou not wholly unheroic figure , farewell ."
For we have come to his last moment .
"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised , he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea ."
He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him ; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him : a little mark of respect from us at the end .
"He had one last triumph , which I think we need not grudge him ."
"As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air , he invited him with a gesture to use his foot ."
It made Peter kick instead of stab .
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved .
"`` Bad form , '' he cried jeeringly , and went content to the crocodile ."
Thus perished James Hook .
"`` Seventeen , '' Slightly sang out ; but he was not quite correct in his figures ."
"Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night ; but two reached the shore : Starkey to be captured by the redskins , who made him nurse for all their papooses , a melancholy come-down for a pirate ; and Smee , who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles , making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas ."
Hook had feared .
"Wendy , of course , had stood by taking no part in the fight , though watching Peter with glistening eyes ; but now that all was over she became prominent again ."
"She praised them equally , and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one ; and then she took them into Hook 's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail ."
It said `` half-past one ! ''
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all .
"She got them to bed in the pirates ' bunks pretty quickly , you may be sure ; all but Peter , who strutted up and down on the deck , until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom ."
"He had one of his dreams that night , and cried in his sleep for a long time , and Wendy held him tightly ."
"Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps -LSB- legs -RSB- ; for there was a big sea running ; and Tootles , the bo ` sun , was among them , with a rope 's end in his hand and chewing tobacco ."
"They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee , shaved smartly , and tumbled up , with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers ."
It need not be said who was the captain .
Nibs and John were first and second mate .
There was a woman aboard .
"The rest were tars -LSB- sailors -RSB- before the mast , and lived in the fo ` c ` sle ."
"Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel ; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them ; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties , but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast , and if they snapped at him he would tear them ."
"The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood , and they cheered him lustily ."
"Then a few sharp orders were given , and they turned the ship round , and nosed her for the mainland ."
"Captain Pan calculated , after consulting the ship 's chart , that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June , after which it would save time to fly ."
"Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate ; but the captain treated them as dogs , and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin -LSB- one person after another , as they had to Cpt ."
"` Not large enough to draw attention , of course ; but it might come in handy . '"
And with another nod he left her .
The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast .
"He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track , and perceived that though the marks of wolves ' feet were many , not a single guest was to be seen anywhere ."
He knew very well what that meant ; but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid .
"The house door stood open , but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it ."
"However , he entered boldly , and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang , and the whole herd sprang at him , with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths ."
"Quick as they were they were too late , for the mink was already through the knot-hole and racing for his canoe ."
"The knot-hole was too small for the wolves , and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open ."
"Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and , once outside , aimed at the flying mink ; but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws , so they threw them away , and bounded to the shore , with all their speed , to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach ."
"Now , although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves , he had a good start , and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe ."
"They pushed off , but as they dipped the paddles into the water , they snapped as the bows had done , and were quite useless . '"
"I know where there are some new ones , ' cried a young fellow , leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach ."
"And the mink 's heart smote him when he heard , for he had not known of this secret store ."
"After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey , and the mink , seeing it was no good resisting any more , gave himself up ."
"Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands , which they always carried wound round their bodies , but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them ."
"` Why I could snap those in a moment , ' said he ; ` if you want to make sure that I can not escape , better take a line of kelp and bind me with that . '"
"` You are right , ' answered the grandfather ; ` your wisdom is greater than ours . '"
"And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line , as they had brought none with them ."
"` While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance , ' remarked the mink ."
"And the wolves replied : ` Very good , you may have your dance ; perhaps it may amuse us as well as you . '"
So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other .
"The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance , first in one canoe and then in the other ; and so graceful was he , that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death , and howled with pleasure ."
"` Pull the canoes a little apart ; they are too close for this new dance , ' he said , pausing for a moment ."
"And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs , sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both ."
"` Now nearer , now further apart , ' he would cry as the dance went on ."
` No !
further still . '
"And springing into the air , amidst howls of applause , he came down head-foremost , and dived to the bottom ."
"And through the wolves , whose howls had now changed into those of rage , sought him everywhere , they never found him , for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight , and then made his home in another forest ."
Adventures of an Indian Brave -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"A long , long way off , right away in the west of America , there once lived an old man who had one son ."
"You have got a conscience , though you are a little boy , and you must learn to mind it . ''"
"`` Well , my conscience did n't prick me a bit when she said ` Let 's get over the wall , ' '' answered Rob , quoting one of Demi 's expressions ."
`` Did you stop to see if it did ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Then you can not tell . ''
"`` I guess it 's such a little conscience that it do n't prick hard enough for me to feel it , '' added Rob , after thinking the matter over for a minute ."
`` We must sharpen it up .
"It 's bad to have a dull conscience ; so you may stay here till dinner-time , and talk about it with Nan ."
I trust you both not to untie yourselves till I say the word . ''
"`` No , we wo n't , '' said both , feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping to punish themselves ."
"For an hour they were very good , then they grew tired of one room , and longed to get out ."
"Never had the hall seemed so inviting ; even the little bedroom acquired a sudden interest , and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed ."
"The open windows drove them wild because they could not reach them ; and the outer world seemed so beautiful , they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull ."
"Nan pined for a race round the lawn , and Rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning , and wondered what poor Pollux would do ."
"They watched the clock , and Nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds , while Rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them ."
"It was maddening to smell the dinner , to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding , and to feel that they would not be on the spot to secure good helps of both ."
"When Mary Ann began to set the table , they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there was to be ; and Nan offered to help her make the beds , if she would only see that she had `` lots of sauce on her pudding . ''"
"When the boys came bursting out of school , they found the children tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts , and were much edified , as well as amused , by the sequel to the exciting adventures of the night ."
"`` Untie me now , Marmar ; my conscience will prick like a pin next time , I know it will , '' said Rob , as the bell rang , and Teddy came to look at him with sorrowful surprise ."
"`` We shall see , '' answered his mother , setting him free ."
"He took a good run down the hall , back through the dining-room , and brought up beside Nan , quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction ."
"`` I 'll bring her dinner to her , may I ? ''"
"he asked , pitying his fellow-captive ."
`` That 's my kind little son !
"Yes , pull out the table , and get a chair ; '' and Mrs. Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others , who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon ."
"Nan ate alone , and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa ."
"Mrs. Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window ; and there she stood watching the boys play , and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty ."
"Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn , so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it ."
"Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her ; Demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself , which amused Nan a good deal ; and Dan brought a little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power ."
But nothing atoned for the loss of freedom ; and a few hours of confinement taught Nan how precious it was .
A good many thoughts went through the little head that lay on the window-sill during the last quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emil 's new ship launched .
"She was to have christened it , and had depended on smashing a tiny bottle of currant-wine over the prow as it was named Josephine in honor of Mrs. Bhaer ."
"`` Mother , '' said I , `` take the whole and let 's be going , '' for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet 's nest about our ears , though how thankful I was that I had bolted it , none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man ."
"But my mother , frightened as she was , would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less ."
"It was not yet seven , she said , by a long way ; she knew her rights and she would have them ; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill ."
"That was enough , and more than enough , for both of us ."
"`` I 'll take what I have , '' she said , jumping to her feet ."
"`` And I 'll take this to square the count , '' said I , picking up the oilskin packet ."
"Next moment we were both groping downstairs , leaving the candle by the empty chest ; and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat ."
We had not started a moment too soon .
The fog was rapidly dispersing ; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side ; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape .
"Far less than half-way to the hamlet , very little beyond the bottom of the hill , we must come forth into the moonlight ."
"Nor was this all , for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears , and as we looked back in their direction , a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern ."
"`` My dear , '' said my mother suddenly , `` take the money and run on ."
I am going to faint . ''
"This was certainly the end for both of us , I thought ."
"How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours ; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed , for her past foolhardiness and present weakness !"
"We were just at the little bridge , by good fortune ; and I helped her , tottering as she was , to the edge of the bank , where , sure enough , she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder ."
"I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all , and I am afraid it was roughly done , but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch ."
"Farther I could not move her , for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it ."
So there we had to stay -- my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn .
"5 The Last of the Blind Man MY curiosity , in a sense , was stronger than my fear , for I could not remain where I was , but crept back to the bank again , whence , sheltering my head behind a bush of broom , I might command the road before our door ."
"I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive , seven or eight of them , running hard , their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front ."
"Three men ran together , hand in hand ; and I made out , even through the mist , that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar ."
The next moment his voice showed me that I was right .
`` Down with the door ! ''
he cried .
"`` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"answered two or three ; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow , the lantern-bearer following ; and then I could see them pause , and hear speeches passed in a lower key , as if they were surprised to find the door open ."
"But the pause was brief , for the blind man again issued his commands ."
"His voice sounded louder and higher , as if he were afire with eagerness and rage ."
"`` In , in , in ! ''"
"he shouted , and cursed them for their delay ."
"Four or five of them obeyed at once , two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar ."
`` But I will be cruelly avenged .
"I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton -- she that is to be , '' she added , curtseying ."
"`` Joanna , '' she continued , `` I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight , but he is , let me tell you plainly , the softest-hearted simpleton in England ."
Go to -- ye may do your pleasure with him !
"And now , fool children , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let us all three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir ; for these woods , methinks , are full of peril and exceeding cold . ''"
`` But did my Dick make love to you ? ''
"asked Joanna , clinging to her sweetheart 's side ."
"`` Nay , fool girl , '' returned Alicia ; `` it was I made love to him ."
"I offered to marry him , indeed ; but he bade me go marry with my likes ."
These were his words .
"Nay , that I will say : he is more plain than pleasant ."
"But now , children , for the sake of sense , set forward ."
"Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? ''"
"`` Why , '' said Dick , `` I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have been sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last days , and my poor body is one bruise ."
But how think ye ?
"If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , had fled away , we should have gone about for nothing ."
"'T is but some three short miles to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow is pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we went even as we are ? ''"
"`` Agreed , '' cried Alicia ; but Joanna only pressed upon Dick 's arm ."
"Forth , then , they went , through open leafless groves and down snow-clad alleys , under the white face of the winter moon ; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure ; and their light-minded companion , her own bereavements heartily forgotten , followed a pace or two behind , now rallying them upon their silence , and now drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives ."
"Still , indeed , in the distance of the wood , the riders of Tunstall might be heard urging their pursuit ; and from time to time cries or the clash of steel announced the shock of enemies ."
"But in these young folk , bred among the alarms of war , and fresh from such a multiplicity of dangers , neither fear nor pity could be lightly wakened ."
"Content to find the sounds still drawing farther and farther away , they gave up their hearts to the enjoyment of the hour , walking already , as Alicia put it , in a wedding procession ; and neither the rude solitude of the forest , nor the cold of the freezing night , had any force to shadow or distract their happiness ."
"At length , from a rising hill , they looked below them on the dell of Holywood ."
"The great windows of the forest abbey shone with torch and candle ; its high pinnacles and spires arose very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon ."
"All about it , in the open glade , camp-fires were burning , and the ground was thick with huts ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curved ."
"`` By the mass , '' said Richard , `` there are Lord Foxham 's fellows still encamped ."
The messenger hath certainly miscarried .
"Well , then , so better ."
We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . ''
"But if Lord Foxham 's men still lay encamped in the long holm at Holywood , it was from a different reason from the one supposed by Dick ."
"They had marched , indeed , for Shoreby ; but ere they were half way thither , a second messenger met them , and bade them return to their morning 's camp , to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitives , and to be so much nearer to the main army of York ."
"For Richard of Gloucester , having finished the battle and stamped out his foes in that district , was already on the march to rejoin his brother ; and not long after the return of my Lord Foxham 's retainers , Crookback himself drew rein before the abbey door ."
"To add to our concern , we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore , and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether , if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen , they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm ."
"Hunter was steady , that we knew ; Joyce was a doubtful case -- a pleasant , polite man for a valet and to brush one 's clothes , but not entirely fitted for a man of war ."
"With all this in our minds , we waded ashore as fast as we could , leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions ."
"18 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : End of the First Day 's Fighting WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade , and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer ."
Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket .
I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming .
"`` Captain , '' said I , `` Trelawney is the dead shot ."
Give him your gun ; his own is useless . ''
"They exchanged guns , and Trelawney , silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle , hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service ."
"At the same time , observing Gray to be unarmed , I handed him my cutlass ."
"It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand , knit his brows , and make the blade sing through the air ."
It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt .
Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us .
"We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side , and almost at the same time , seven mutineers -- Job Anderson , the boatswain , at their head -- appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner ."
"They paused as if taken aback , and before they recovered , not only the squire and I , but Hunter and Joyce from the block house , had time to fire ."
"The four shots came in rather a scattering volley , but they did the business : one of the enemy actually fell , and the rest , without hesitation , turned and plunged into the trees ."
"After reloading , we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy ."
He was stone dead -- shot through the heart .
"We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush , a ball whistled close past my ear , and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground ."
"Both the squire and I returned the shot , but as we had nothing to aim at , it is probable we only wasted powder ."
Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom .
"The captain and Gray were already examining him , and I saw with half an eye that all was over ."
"I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more , for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried , groaning and bleeding , into the log-house ."
"Poor old fellow , he had not uttered one word of surprise , complaint , fear , or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now , when we had laid him down in the log-house to die ."
"He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery ; he had followed every order silently , doggedly , and well ; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years ; and now , sullen , old , serviceable servant , it was he that was to die ."
"The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand , crying like a child ."
"`` Be I going , doctor ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Tom , my man , '' said I , `` you 're going home . ''"
"`` I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first , '' he replied ."
"`` Tom , '' said the squire , `` say you forgive me , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Would that be respectful like , from me to you , squire ? ''"
"`` Sir Richard , '' replied the man-at-arms , `` I would follow the line until they scatter . ''"
"`` Ye are , doubtless , right , '' returned Dick ; `` but we came right hastily upon the errand , even as the time commanded ."
"Here are no houses , neither for food nor shelter , and by the morrow 's dawn we shall know both cold fingers and an empty belly ."
"How say ye , lads ?"
"Will ye stand a pinch for expedition 's sake , or shall we turn by Holywood and sup with Mother Church ?"
"The case being somewhat doubtful , I will drive no man ; yet if ye would suffer me to lead you , ye would choose the first . ''"
"The men answered , almost with one voice , that they would follow Sir Richard where he would ."
"And Dick , setting spur to his horse , began once more to go forward ."
"The snow in the trail had been trodden very hard , and the pursuers had thus a great advantage over the pursued ."
"They pushed on , indeed , at a round trot , two hundred hoofs beating alternately on the dull pavement of the snow , and the jingle of weapons and the snorting of horses raising a warlike noise along the arches of the silent wood ."
"Presently , the wide slot of the pursued came out upon the high road from Holywood ; it was there , for a moment , indistinguishable ; and , where it once more plunged into the unbeaten snow upon the farther side , Dick was surprised to see it narrower and lighter trod ."
"Plainly , profiting by the road , Sir Daniel had begun already to scatter his command ."
"At all hazards , one chance being equal to another , Dick continued to pursue the straight trail ; and that , after an hour 's riding , in which it led into the very depths of the forest , suddenly split , like a bursting shell , into two dozen others , leading to every point of the compass ."
Dick drew bridle in despair .
"The short winter 's day was near an end ; the sun , a dull red orange , shorn of rays , swam low among the leafless thickets ; the shadows were a mile long upon the snow ; the frost bit cruelly at the finger-nails ; and the breath and steam of the horses mounted in a cloud ."
"`` Well , we are outwitted , '' Dick confessed ."
"`` Strike we for Holywood , after all ."
It is still nearer us than Tunstall -- or should be by the station of the sun . ''
"So they wheeled to their left , turning their backs on the red shield of sun , and made across country for the abbey ."
"But now times were changed with them ; they could no longer spank forth briskly on a path beaten firm by the passage of their foes , and for a goal to which that path itself conducted them ."
"Now they must plough at a dull pace through the encumbering snow , continually pausing to decide their course , continually floundering in drifts ."
"The sun soon left them ; the glow of the west decayed ; and presently they were wandering in a shadow of blackness , under frosty stars ."
"Presently , indeed , the moon would clear the hilltops , and they might resume their march ."
"But till then , every random step might carry them wider of their march ."
There was nothing for it but to camp and wait .
"Sentries were posted ; a spot of ground was cleared of snow , and , after some failures , a good fire blazed in the midst ."
"The men-at-arms sat close about this forest hearth , sharing such provisions as they had , and passing about the flask ; and Dick , having collected the most delicate of the rough and scanty fare , brought it to Lord Risingham 's niece , where she sat apart from the soldiery against a tree ."
"She sat upon one horse-cloth , wrapped in another , and stared straight before her at the firelit scene ."
"At the offer of food she started , like one wakened from a dream , and then silently refused ."
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` let me beseech you , punish me not so cruelly ."
"Wherein I have offended you , I know not ; I have , indeed , carried you away , but with a friendly violence ; I have , indeed , exposed you to the inclemency of night , but the hurry that lies upon me hath for its end the preservation of another , who is no less frail and no less unfriended than yourself ."
"At least , madam , punish not yourself ; and eat , if not for hunger , then for strength . ''"
"He may be brave in battle , but he hath the liar 's eye ; there is fear in his eye , Dick , and fear is as cruel as the wolf !"
"We go down into that house , Saint Mary guide us forth again ! ''"
"And so they continued their descent in silence , and came out at last before Sir Daniel 's forest stronghold , where it stood , low and shady , flanked with round towers and stained with moss and lichen , in the lilied waters of the moat ."
"Even as they appeared , the doors were opened , the bridge lowered , and Sir Daniel himself , with Hatch and the parson at his side , stood ready to receive them ."
BOOK II -- THE MOAT HOUSE CHAPTER I -- DICK ASKS QUESTIONS The Moat House stood not far from the rough forest road .
"Externally , it was a compact rectangle of red stone , flanked at each corner by a round tower , pierced for archery and battlemented at the top ."
"Within , it enclosed a narrow court ."
"The moat was perhaps twelve feet wide , crossed by a single drawbridge ."
"It was supplied with water by a trench , leading to a forest pool and commanded , through its whole length , from the battlements of the two southern towers ."
"Except that one or two tall and thick trees had been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the walls , the house was in a good posture for defence ."
"In the court , Dick found a part of the garrison , busy with preparations for defence , and gloomily discussing the chances of a siege ."
"Some were making arrows , some sharpening swords that had long been disused ; but even as they worked , they shook their heads ."
"Twelve of Sir Daniel 's party had escaped the battle , run the gauntlet through the wood , and come alive to the Moat House ."
"But out of this dozen , three had been gravely wounded : two at Risingham in the disorder of the rout , one by John Amend-All 's marksmen as he crossed the forest ."
"This raised the force of the garrison , counting Hatch , Sir Daniel , and young Shelton , to twenty-two effective men ."
And more might be continually expected to arrive .
The danger lay not therefore in the lack of men .
It was the terror of the Black Arrow that oppressed the spirits of the garrison .
"For their open foes of the party of York , in these most changing times , they felt but a far-away concern ."
"`` The world , '' as people said in those days , `` might change again '' before harm came ."
"But for their neighbours in the wood , they trembled ."
It was not Sir Daniel alone who was a mark for hatred .
"His men , conscious of impunity , had carried themselves cruelly through all the country ."
"Harsh commands had been harshly executed ; and of the little band that now sat talking in the court , there was not one but had been guilty of some act of oppression or barbarity ."
"And now , by the fortune of war , Sir Daniel had become powerless to protect his instruments ; now , by the issue of some hours of battle , at which many of them had not been present , they had all become punishable traitors to the State , outside the buckler of the law , a shrunken company in a poor fortress that was hardly tenable , and exposed upon all sides to the just resentment of their victims ."
Nor had there been lacking grisly advertisements of what they might expect .
"At different periods of the evening and the night , no fewer than seven riderless horses had come neighing in terror to the gate ."
Two were from Selden 's troop ; five belonged to men who had ridden with Sir Daniel to the field .
"Lastly , a little before dawn , a spearman had come staggering to the moat side , pierced by three arrows ; even as they carried him in , his spirit had departed ; but by the words that he uttered in his agony , he must have been the last survivor of a considerable company of men ."
"Hatch himself showed , under his sun-brown , the pallour of anxiety ; and when he had taken Dick aside and learned the fate of Selden , he fell on a stone bench and fairly wept ."
"The others , from where they sat on stools or doorsteps in the sunny angle of the court , looked at him with wonder and alarm , but none ventured to inquire the cause of his emotion ."
"`` Nay , Master Shelton , '' said Hatch , at last -- `` nay , but what said I ?"
"And in a moment a crowd of beautiful creatures , each one with a crown on her head , stood before her ."
"Certainly none could have guessed that they were the snails , water-rats , and grasshoppers from which she had chosen her retinue ."
"At a sign from the frog the fairies danced a ballet , with which everyone was so delighted that they begged to have to repeated ; but now it was not youths and maidens who were dancing , but flowers ."
"Then these again melted into fountains , whose waters interlaced and , rushing down the sides of the hall , poured out in a cascade down the steps , and formed a river found the castle , with the most beautiful little boats upon it , all painted and gilded ."
"` Oh , let us go in them for a sail ! '"
"cried the princess , who had long ago left her game of ball for a sight of these marvels , and , as she was bent upon it , the ambassadors , who had been charged never to lose sight of her , were obliged to go also , though they never entered a boat if they could help it ."
"But the moment they and the princess had seated themselves on the soft cushions , river and boats vanished , and the princess and the ambassadors vanished too ."
Instead the snails and grasshoppers and water-rats stood round the frog in their natural shapes .
"` Perhaps , ' said she , ` your Majesty may now be convinced that I am a fairy and speak the truth ."
Therefore lose no time in setting in order the affairs of your kingdom and go in search of your wife .
"Here is a ring that will admit you into the presence of the queen , and will likewise allow you to address unharmed the Lion Fairy , though she is the most terrible creature that ever existed . '"
"By this time the king had forgotten all about the princess , whom he had only chosen to please his people , and was as eager to depart on his journey as the frog was for him to go ."
"He made one of his ministers regent of the kingdom , and gave the frog everything her heart could desire ; and with her ring on his finger he rode away to the outskirts of the forest ."
"Here he dismounted , and bidding his horse go home , he pushed forward on foot ."
"Having nothing to guide him as to where he was likely to find the entrance of the under-world , the king wandered hither and thither for a long while , till , one day , while he was resting under a tree , a voice spoke to him ."
"` Why do you give yourself so much trouble for nought , when you might know what you want to know for the asking ?"
Alone you will never discover the path that leads to your wife . '
"Much startled , the king looked about him ."
"He could see nothing , and somehow , when he thought about it , the voice seemed as if it were part of himself ."
"Suddenly his eyes fell on the ring , and he understood ."
` Fool that I was ! '
cried he ; ` and how much precious time have I wasted ?
"Dear ring , I beseech you , grant me a vision of my wife and my daughter ! '"
"And even as he spoke there flashed past him a huge lioness , followed by a lady and a beautiful young maid mounted on fairy horses ."
"Almost fainting with joy he gazed after them , and then sank back trembling on the ground ."
"` Oh , lead me to them , lead me to them ! '"
he exclaimed .
"And the ring , bidding him take courage , conducted him safely to the dismal place where his wife had lived for ten years ."
"Now the Lion Fairy knew beforehand of his expected presence in her dominions , and she ordered a palace of crystal to be built in the middle of the lake of quicksilver ; and in order to make it more difficult of approach she let it float whither it would ."
"Immediately after their return from the chase , where the king had seen them , she conveyed the queen and Muffette into the palace , and put them under the guard of the monsters of the lake , who one and all had fallen in love with the princess ."
"They were horribly jealous , and ready to eat each other up for her sake , so they readily accepted the charge ."
"Some stationed themselves round the floating palace , some sat by the door , while the smallest and lightest perched themselves on the roof ."
Win glory for me : one Richard for another .
"I tell you , if I rise , ye shall rise by the same ladder ."
"Go , '' he added , shaking him by the hand ."
"But , as soon as Dick was gone , he turned to a little shabby archer at his elbow ."
"`` Go , Dutton , and that right speedily , '' he added ."
`` Follow that lad .
"If ye find him faithful , ye answer for his safety , a head for a head ."
"Woe unto you , if ye return without him !"
"But if he be faithless -- or , for one instant , ye misdoubt him -- stab him from behind . ''"
In the meanwhile Dick hastened to secure his post .
"The street he had to guard was very narrow , and closely lined with houses , which projected and overhung the roadway ; but narrow and dark as it was , since it opened upon the market-place of the town , the main issue of the battle would probably fall to be decided on that spot ."
"The market-place was full of townspeople fleeing in disorder ; but there was as yet no sign of any foeman ready to attack , and Dick judged he had some time before him to make ready his defence ."
"The two houses at the end stood deserted , with open doors , as the inhabitants had left them in their flight , and from these he had the furniture hastily tossed forth and piled into a barrier in the entry of the lane ."
"A hundred men were placed at his disposal , and of these he threw the more part into the houses , where they might lie in shelter and deliver their arrows from the windows ."
"With the rest , under his own immediate eye , he lined the barricade ."
"Meanwhile the utmost uproar and confusion had continued to prevail throughout the town ; and what with the hurried clashing of bells , the sounding of trumpets , the swift movement of bodies of horse , the cries of the commanders , and the shrieks of women , the noise was almost deafening to the ear ."
"Presently , little by little , the tumult began to subside ; and soon after , files of men in armour and bodies of archers began to assemble and form in line of battle in the market-place ."
"A large portion of this body were in murrey and blue , and in the mounted knight who ordered their array Dick recognised Sir Daniel Brackley ."
"Then there befell a long pause , which was followed by the almost simultaneous sounding of four trumpets from four different quarters of the town ."
"A fifth rang in answer from the market-place , and at the same moment the files began to move , and a shower of arrows rattled about the barricade , and sounded like blows upon the walls of the two flanking houses ."
"The attack had begun , by a common signal , on all the five issues of the quarter ."
"Gloucester was beleaguered upon every side ; and Dick judged , if he would make good his post , he must rely entirely on the hundred men of his command ."
"Seven volleys of arrows followed one upon the other , and in the very thick of the discharges Dick was touched from behind upon the arm , and found a page holding out to him a leathern jack , strengthened with bright plates of mail ."
"`` It is from my Lord of Gloucester , '' said the page ."
"`` He hath observed , Sir Richard , that ye went unarmed . ''"
"Dick , with a glow at his heart at being so addressed , got to his feet and , with the assistance of the page , donned the defensive coat ."
"Even as he did so , two arrows rattled harmlessly upon the plates , and a third struck down the page , mortally wounded , at his feet ."
Meantime the whole body of the enemy had been steadily drawing nearer across the market-place ; and by this time were so close at hand that Dick gave the order to return their shot .
"Immediately , from behind the barrier and from the windows of the houses , a counterblast of arrows sped , carrying death ."
"But the Lancastrians , as if they had but waited for a signal , shouted loudly in answer ; and began to close at a run upon the barrier , the horsemen still hanging back , with visors lowered ."
"Then followed an obstinate and deadly struggle , hand to hand ."
"The assailants , wielding their falchions with one hand , strove with the other to drag down the structure of the barricade ."
"Hook , of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared ."
"He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men , and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace ."
"As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them , and as dogs they obeyed him ."
"In person he was cadaverous and blackavized , and his hair was dressed in long curls , which at a little distance looked like black candles , and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance ."
"His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not , and of a profound melancholy , save when he was plunging his hook into you , at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly ."
"In manner , something of the grand seigneur still clung to him , so that he even ripped you up with an air , and I have been told that he was a raconteur of repute ."
"He was never more sinister than when he was most polite , which is probably the truest test of breeding ; and the elegance of his diction , even when he was swearing , no less than the distinction of his demeanour , showed him one of a different caste from his crew ."
"A man of indomitable courage , it was said of him that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood , which was thick and of an unusual colour ."
"In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II. , having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts ; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once ."
But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw .
"Let us now kill a pirate , to show Hook 's method ."
Skylights will do .
"As they pass , Skylights lurches clumsily against him , ruffling his lace collar ; the hook shoots forth , there is a tearing sound and one screech , then the body is kicked aside , and the pirates pass on ."
He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth .
Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted .
Which will win ?
"On the trail of the pirates , stealing noiselessly down the war-path , which is not visible to inexperienced eyes , come the redskins , every one of them with his eyes peeled ."
"They carry tomahawks and knives , and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil ."
"Strung around them are scalps , of boys as well as of pirates , for these are the Piccaninny tribe , and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons ."
"In the van , on all fours , is Great Big Little Panther , a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress ."
"Bringing up the rear , the place of greatest danger , comes Tiger Lily , proudly erect , a princess in her own right ."
"She is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies , coquettish , cold and amorous by turns ; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife , but she staves off the altar with a hatchet ."
Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise .
The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing .
"The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging , but in time they will work this off ."
"For the moment , however , it constitutes their chief danger ."
"The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows , and soon their place is taken by the beasts , a great and motley procession : lions , tigers , bears , and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them , for every kind of beast , and , more particularly ; all the man-eaters , live cheek by jowl on the favoured island ."
"Their tongues are hanging out , they are hungry to-night ."
"When they have passed , comes the last figure of all , a gigantic crocodile ."
We shall see for whom she is looking presently .
"The crocodile passes , but soon the boys appear again , for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace ."
Then quickly they will be on top of each other .
"On the other side , the parts were reversed ; and the defenders exposed themselves like madmen to protect their rampart ."
"So for some minutes the contest raged almost in silence , friend and foe falling one upon another ."
"But it is always the easier to destroy ; and when a single note upon the tucket recalled the attacking party from this desperate service , much of the barricade had been removed piecemeal , and the whole fabric had sunk to half its height , and tottered to a general fall ."
"And now the footmen in the market-place fell back , at a run , on every side ."
"The horsemen , who had been standing in a line two deep , wheeled suddenly , and made their flank into their front ; and as swift as a striking adder , the long , steel-clad column was launched upon the ruinous barricade ."
"Of the first two horsemen , one fell , rider and steed , and was ridden down by his companions ."
"The second leaped clean upon the summit of the rampart , transpiercing an archer with his lance ."
Almost in the same instant he was dragged from the saddle and his horse despatched .
And then the full weight and impetus of the charge burst upon and scattered the defenders .
"The men-at-arms , surmounting their fallen comrades , and carried onward by the fury of their onslaught , dashed through Dick 's broken line and poured thundering up the lane beyond , as a stream bestrides and pours across a broken dam ."
Yet was the fight not over .
"Still , in the narrow jaws of the entrance , Dick and a few survivors plied their bills like woodmen ; and already , across the width of the passage , there had been formed a second , a higher , and a more effectual rampart of fallen men and disembowelled horses , lashing in the agonies of death ."
"Baffled by this fresh obstacle , the remainder of the cavalry fell back ; and as , at the sight of this movement , the flight of arrows redoubled from the casements of the houses , their retreat had , for a moment , almost degenerated into flight ."
"Almost at the same time , those who had crossed the barricade and charged farther up the street , being met before the door of the Chequers by the formidable hunchback and the whole reserve of the Yorkists , began to come scattering backward , in the excess of disarray and terror ."
"Dick and his fellows faced about , fresh men poured out of the houses ; a cruel blast of arrows met the fugitives full in the face , while Gloucester was already riding down their rear ; in the inside of a minute and a half there was no living Lancastrian in the street ."
"Then , and not till then , did Dick hold up his reeking blade and give the word to cheer ."
Meanwhile Gloucester dismounted from his horse and came forward to inspect the post .
"His face was as pale as linen ; but his eyes shone in his head like some strange jewel , and his voice , when he spoke , was hoarse and broken with the exultation of battle and success ."
"He looked at the rampart , which neither friend nor foe could now approach without precaution , so fiercely did the horses struggle in the throes of death , and at the sight of that great carnage he smiled upon one side ."
"`` Despatch these horses , '' he said ; `` they keep you from your vantage ."
"Richard Shelton , '' he added , `` ye have pleased me ."
Kneel . ''
"The Lancastrians had already resumed their archery , and the shafts fell thick in the mouth of the street ; but the duke , minding them not at all , deliberately drew his sword and dubbed Richard a knight upon the spot ."
"`` And now , Sir Richard , '' he continued , `` if that ye see Lord Risingham , send me an express upon the instant ."
"Were it your last man , let me hear of it incontinently ."
I had rather venture the post than lose my stroke at him .
"For mark me , all of ye , '' he added , raising his voice , `` if Earl Risingham fall by another hand than mine , I shall count this victory a defeat . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one of his attendants , `` is your grace not weary of exposing his dear life unneedfully ?"
Why tarry we here ? ''
"`` Catesby , '' returned the duke , `` here is the battle , not elsewhere ."
The rest are but feigned onslaughts .
Here must we vanquish .
"Now the other forest people would have liked to watch the Bat longer, but after the Ground Hog had gone off in this way, they thought it would show too much curiosity if they stayed. So one after another went away, and the little Bat was left alone. He fluttered around until he reached the branch where the Blue Jay had been, and there he hung himself up to wait until night."
"""Oh dear!"" he said, ""I wonder how long a day is. I am hot and blind and sleepy, and if any more of the forest people come and talk about me, I don't know what I shall do. They don't think me good-looking because my wings grow to my legs. I only wish I could see what they look like. I believe they are just as homely."""
"And then, because he was a very tired little Bat, and cross, as people always are when they have done wrong, he began to blame somebody else for all his trouble."
"""If my father and mother had cared very much about me,"" he said, ""they would never have let me stay up all day. Guess if I were a big Bat and had little Bats of my own, I'd take better care of them!"" But that is always the way, and when, long afterward, he was a big Bat with little Bats of his own, he was a much wiser person."
A SWARM LEAVES THE BEE TREE
"The old Bee tree was becoming very crowded and the Queen-Mother grew restless. There were many things to make her so. In the tree were thousands of cells made ready for her eggs, and she had been busy for days putting one in each. In the larger cells she laid eggs that would hatch out Drones, and in the smaller ones she laid Worker eggs. She never laid any Queen eggs. Perhaps she did not want any Queens among her children, for there can never be two Queens in one swarm, and when a new one is hatched, the Queen-Mother has to go away and find another home."
That is a law among the Bees.
"The Workers, however, knew that there must be young Queens growing up all the time. Supposing something should happen to the Queen-Mother, what would become of the swarm if there were nobody to lay eggs? So after she had laid several thousand Worker eggs, and it was time for the young ones to hatch, they decided to change some of the babies into young Queens. And this was easy enough. When they were out for honey, they filled the pockets on their hind legs with pollen, the yellow dust that is found in flowers. This was to be mixed with honey and water and made into bread for the babies, who were now awake, and looked like tiny white worms in the bottom of their cells. Then they made some that was almost like sour jelly, and put it in a few of the Worker cells for the tiny white worms, or Larvæ, to eat. The Larvæ that eat this jelly grow up to be Queens, and can lay eggs. Those that eat the common bread are either Drones or Workers, whichever their mother had planned them to be."
"After the Larvæ were five or six days old, the Workers shut them up in their cells and stopped feeding them. That was because the Larvæ had other things to do than eat. They had to spin their cocoons, and lie in them until they were grown and ready to come out among the older Bees."
"When a Larva, or Bee baby, has finished its cocoon, and is lying inside, it is called a Pupa, and when a Pupa is full grown and has torn its way out of the cocoon and wax, it is called a Drone, or a Worker, or a Queen."
"Now the Queen-Mother was restless. She could hear the young Queens piping in their cells, and she knew that they wanted to come out and drive her away. She wanted to get to them and stop their piping, but the Workers stood in her way and prevented her. They knew it would not be well for the Queen-Mother to meet her royal children, and when these children tried to come out the Workers covered the doors of their cells with another layer of wax, leaving little holes where they could put out their tongues and be fed."
"This made the Queen-Mother more restless than ever. ""If I cannot do as I wish to with my own children,"" she said, ""I will leave the tree."" And she began walking back and forth as fast as she could, and talked a great deal, and acted almost wild with impatience. The Workers saw how she felt, and part of them decided to go with her. When a Worker made up her mind to go with the Queen-Mother, she showed it by also acting wild and walking back and forth, and talking a great deal, sometimes fluttering her wings very fast. Then she would go for honey, because when Bees are about to swarm they fill their honey-pockets just as full as they can. At times the Queen-Mother would be quiet, and you might almost think that she had given up going. Then suddenly she would grow restless again, and all the Workers who were going with her would act as she did, and they would get so warm with excitement that the air in the tree became quite hot."
"At last the Queen-Mother thought it time to start, and her followers came around her in the tree, and were very still for a minute. Several of the Workers had been flying in circles around the tree, and now they came to the doorway and called. Then all came out, and hovered in the air a few minutes before stopping to rest on a bush near by. When they rested, the first Bee held on to the bush, the next Bee held on to her, and that was the way they did until they were all clinging tightly together in a squirming, dark-brown mass."
"Ah, then the Queen-Mother was happy! She felt that she was young again, and she thought, ""How they love me, these dear Workers!"" She stroked her body with her legs to make herself as fine as possible, and she noticed, with pleasure, how slender she was growing. ""I had thought I should never fly again,"" she said, ""yet this is delightful. I believe I will go off by myself for a little while."""
So she flew off by herself and was talking rather airily to a Butterfly when two of the Workers came after her.
"""You may return to the rest,"" she said in a queenly way, as she motioned to them with her feelers. ""I will come by and by."""
"""No,"" said they, ""you must come at once or we shall all go back to the Bee tree. You must stay with us. You must do your part as it should be done."" And she had to go, for she knew in her heart that Queens have to obey the law as well as other people."
"After she had hung with the Workers on the bush for some time, the ones who had gone ahead to find a new home for the swarm came back and gave the signal for the rest to follow. They went to an old log near the river-bank, and here they began the real work. Crawling through an opening at one end, they found a roomy place within, and commenced to clean house at once."
"""If there is anything I do like,"" said a Worker, as she dropped a splinter of rotten wood outside the door, ""it is house-cleaning."""
"""So do I,"" said her sister. ""But what a fuss the Drones always make when we try to do anything of the sort! A pretty-looking home we'd have if they took care of it!"""
"""I'm glad none of them came with us to this place,"" said the first Worker. ""I guess they knew they were not wanted."""
"""There, there!"" said the Queen-Mother, coming up to where they were; ""you must not talk in that way. It may be that you would rather do without Drones, and perhaps they would rather do without you; but I need you both and I will not have any quarreling."" When she said this she walked away with her head in the air, and the Workers did not scold any more. They knew that she was right, and, after all, she was their Queen, even if she did have to obey the laws."
"Next they got varnish from the buds of poplar trees and varnished over all the cracks and little holes in the walls of their home, leaving open only the place where they were to go in and out. They also covered with varnish a few heavy fragments of wood that lay on the floor of their home, and when this task was done it was all in order and ready for the furniture, that is, the comb."
"You know how the comb looks, and you know how they get the wax from which to make it, but unless you are acquainted with the Bees, and have seen them at work, you have no idea what busy creatures they are. The Queen-Mother, as soon as the cells were ready and she could begin laying eggs again, was as contented and happy as ever."
"One day, when she was walking around a corner of the comb, she ran against a sad and discouraged-looking Worker. ""Why, what is the matter?"""
"said she, kindly. ""Are you sick?"""
"""No,"" answered the Worker. ""I'm not sick and I'm not tired, only I want to get through."""
"""Through with what?"" asked the Queen."
"""With work! It is clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. And when they get old enough they'll have to clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. I want to know when it is going to stop, and Bees can spend their time in play."""
"""Never,"" said the Queen-Mother; and she spoke very gently, for she saw that the Worker was crazy. ""It will never stop. If you had nothing to do but play all your life you would soon want to die, and you ought to, for there is no place in this world for idlers. You know that after a while the Drones die because they do nothing, and it is right they should."""
"""Don't you ever get tired of your eggs?"" asked the Worker."
"""Now the time is up,"" bawled the King; ""come hither, headsman, and take off his head."""
"""Nay, nay!"" said the lad; ""stop a bit, there are still three minutes!"
"Out with the key, and let me get into this house."""
"But there stood the King and fumbled with his keys, to draw out the time. At last he said he hadn't any key."
"""Well, if you haven't, I have,"" said the lad, as he gave the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the floor."
"At the door the Princess met him, and told her father this was her deliverer, on whom her heart was set. So she had him; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry the daughter of the King of Arabia."
PRINCE LINDWORM
"Once upon a time, there was a fine young King who was married to the loveliest of Queens. They were exceedingly happy, all but for one thing they had no children. And this often made them both sad, because the Queen wanted a dear little child to play with, and the King wanted an heir to the kingdom."
"One day the Queen went out for a walk by herself, and she met an ugly old woman. The old woman was just like a witch: but she was a nice kind of witch, not the cantankerous sort. She said, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lady?"" ""It's no use my telling you,"" answered the Queen, ""nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"""
"said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."""
"""My dear woman, how can you?"" said the Queen: and she told her, ""The King and I have no children: that's why I am so distressed."" ""Well, you needn't be,"" said the old witch. ""I can set that right in a twinkling, if only you will do exactly as I tell you. Listen."
"To-night, at sunset, take a little drinking-cup with two ears"" (that is, handles), ""and put it bottom upwards on the ground in the north-west corner of your garden. Then go and lift it up to-morrow morning at sunrise, and you will find two roses underneath it, one red and one white. If you eat the red rose, a little boy will be born to you: if you eat the white rose, a little girl will be sent. But, whatever you do, you mustn't eat both the roses, or you'll be sorry, that I warn you! Only one: remember that!"" ""Thank you a thousand times,"" said the Queen, ""this is good news indeed!"" And she wanted to give the old woman her gold ring; but the old woman wouldn't take it."
"So the Queen went home and did as she had been told: and next morning at sunrise she stole out into the garden and lifted up the little drinking-cup. She was surprised, for indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. But there were the two roses underneath it, one red and one white. And now she was dreadfully puzzled, for she did not know which to choose. ""If I choose the red one,"" she thought, ""and I have a little boy, he may grow up and go to the wars and get killed."
"But if I choose the white one, and have a little girl, she will stay at home awhile with us, but later on she will get married and go away and leave us. So, whichever it is, we may be left with no child after all."""
"However, at last she decided on the white rose, and she ate it. And it tasted so sweet, that she took and ate the red one too: without ever remembering the old woman's solemn warning."
"Some time after this, the King went away to the wars: and while he was still away, the Queen became the mother of twins. One was a lovely baby-boy, and the other was a Lindworm, or Serpent. She was terribly frightened when she saw the Lindworm, but he wriggled away out of the room, and nobody seemed to have seen him but herself: so that she thought it must have been a dream. The baby Prince was so beautiful and so healthy, the Queen was full of joy: and likewise, as you may suppose, was the King when he came home and found his son and heir. Not a word was said by anyone about the Lindworm: only the Queen thought about it now and then."
"Many days and years passed by, and the baby grew up into a handsome young Prince, and it was time that he got married. The King sent him off to visit foreign kingdoms, in the Royal coach, with six white horses, to look for a Princess grand enough to be his wife. But at the very first cross-roads, the way was stopped by an enormous Lindworm, enough to frighten the bravest. He lay in the middle of the road with a great wide open mouth, and cried, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" Then the Prince made the coach turn round and try another road: but it was all no use. For, at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm again, crying out, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the Prince had to turn back home again to the Castle, and give up his visits to the foreign kingdoms. And his mother, the Queen, had to confess that what the Lindworm said was true. For he was really the eldest of her twins: and so he ought to have a wedding first."
"There seemed nothing for it but to find a bride for the Lindworm, if his younger brother, the Prince, were to be married at all. So the King wrote to a distant country, and asked for a Princess to marry his son (but, of course, he didn't say which son), and presently a Princess arrived. But she wasn't allowed to see her bridegroom until he stood by her side in the great hall and was married to her, and then, of course, it was too late for her to say she wouldn't have him."
But next morning the Princess had disappeared. The Lindworm lay sleeping all alone: and it was quite plain that he had eaten her.
"A little while after, the Prince decided that he might now go journeying again in search of a Princess. And off he drove in the Royal chariot with the six white horses. But at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm, crying with his great wide open mouth, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the carriage tried another road, and the same thing happened, and they had to turn back again this time, just as formerly. And the King wrote to several foreign countries, to know if anyone would marry his son. At last another Princess arrived, this time from a very far distant land. And, of course, she was not allowed to see her future husband before the wedding took place, and then, lo and behold! it was the Lindworm who stood at her side. And next morning the Princess had disappeared:"
and the Lindworm lay sleeping all alone; and it was quite clear that he had eaten her.
"By and by the Prince started on his quest for the third time: and at the first cross-roads there lay the Lindworm with his great wide open mouth, demanding a bride as before. And the Prince went straight back to the castle, and told the King: ""You must find another bride for my elder brother."""
"""I don't know where I am to find her,"" said the King, ""I have already made enemies of two great Kings who sent their daughters here as brides: and I have no notion how I can obtain a third lady. People are beginning to say strange things, and I am sure no Princess will dare to come."""
"Now, down in a little cottage near a wood, there lived the King's shepherd, an old man with his only daughter. And the King came one day and said to him, ""Will you give me your daughter to marry my son the Lindworm? And I will make you rich for the rest of your life."" ""No, sire,"" said the shepherd, ""that I cannot do. She is my only child, and I want her to take care of me when I am old. Besides, if the Lindworm would not spare two beautiful Princesses, he won't spare her either. He will just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such a fate."""
"But the King wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer: and at last the old man had to give in."
"Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that she was to be Prince Lindworm's bride, she was utterly in despair. She went out into the woods, crying and wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. And while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and asked her, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?"" The shepherd-girl said, ""It's no use my telling you, for nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"" said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."" ""Ah, how can you?"" said the girl, ""For I am to be married to the King's eldest son, who is a Lindworm. He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and devoured them: and he will eat me too! No wonder I am distressed."""
"""Well, you needn't be,"" said the witch-woman. ""All that can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do exactly as I tell you."" So the girl said she would."
"""Listen, then,"" said the old woman. ""After the marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white shifts. And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,"" (that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) ""and a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can carry in his arms, and have all these brought into your bed-chamber. Then, when the Lindworm tells you to shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. And when all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in your arms, if it's only for one moment."""
"""The last is the worst notion ugh!"" said the shepherd's daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of holding the cold, slimy, scaly Lindworm."
"""Do just as I have said, and all will go well,"" said the old woman."
Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree.
"When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and taken to the castle to be decked as a bride. And she asked for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy could carry in his arms. The ladies and courtiers in the castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. But the King said, ""Let her have whatever she asks for."" She was then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked the loveliest of brides. She was led to the hall where the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side. So they were married, and a great wedding-feast was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king."
"One night, after they had both been flying through forest and over field, he came back to the hollow tree to rest. He expected to find Mrs."
"Owl, for she had started home before he did. She was not there and he grew quite impatient. ""I should like to know what keeps her so long,"" he said, fretfully. After a while he looked into the nest and saw the two big white eggs. ""It is a shame,"" he said. ""Our beautiful eggs will be chilled, and it will be all her fault if we have no Owlets this summer."""
"You see, even then he did not seem to think that he could do anything to keep them warm. But the next time he looked in, he put one feathered foot on the round eggs and was surprised to find how cool they were."
"It fairly made his head feathers stand on end to think of it, and he was so frightened that he forgot to be cross, and stepped right in and covered them with his own breast. What if they had already been left too long, and the Owlets within would never hatch? Would Mrs. Owl ever forgive him for being so stupid? He began to wonder if any of the other fellows would see him. He thought it so absurd for the king of the forest to be hatching out a couple of eggs, instead of swooping around in the dark and frightening the smaller birds."
"The night seemed so long, too. It had always been short enough before, and he had often disliked to have daylight come, for then he had to go to bed. He was very much upset, and it is no wonder that when he heard a doleful wail from a neighboring tree, and knew that his cousin, the Screech Owl, was near, he raised his head and called loudly, ""Hoo-hoo-oooo! Waugh-hoo!"""
"The Screech Owl heard him and flew at once to a branch beside the nest hollow. He was a jolly little fellow in spite of his doleful call, and before he could talk at all he had to bend his body, look behind him, nod his head, and shake himself, as Screech Owls always do when they alight. Then he looked into the tree and saw his big cousin, the Great Horned Owl, the night king of the forest, sitting on the eggs and looking very, very grumpy. How he did laugh! ""What is the matter?"" said he. ""Didn't you like your wife's way of brooding over the eggs? Or did she get tired of staying at home and make you help tend the nest?"""
"""Matter enough,"" grumbled the Great Horned Owl. ""We went hunting together at twilight and she hasn't come home yet. I didn't get into the nest until I had to, but it was growing very cold and I wouldn't miss having our eggs hatch for anything. Ugh-whoo! How my legs do ache!"""
"""Well,"" said his cousin, ""you are having a hard time. Are you hungry?"""
"The Great Horned Owl said that he was, so the Screech Owl went hunting and brought him food. ""I will look in every night,"" he said, ""and bring you a lunch. I'm afraid something has happened to your wife and that she will not be back."""
"As he flew away he called out, ""It is too bad. I am very sorry for you. But then, I suppose you would never have the Owlets if you didn't stick to the nest."""
"This last remark made the Great Horned Owl quite angry. ""Much he knows about it,"" he said. ""I guess if he had ever tried it he would be a little more sorry for me."" And then he began to think, ""Who have I heard say those very words before? Who? Who? Who?"""
"All at once the Great Horned Owl remembered how many times he had said just that to his patient wife, and he began to feel very uncomfortable."
"His ears tingled and he felt a queer hot feeling under his face feathers. Perhaps he hadn't been acting very well after all! He knew that even when he told her he was sorry, he had been thinking she made a great fuss. Well, if she would only come back now, that should all be changed, and he shifted his weight and wriggled around into a more comfortable position."
"Now, if this were just a story, one could say that Mrs. Owl came back and that they were all happy together; but the truth is she never did come, and nobody ever knew what became of her. So her husband, the night king of the forest, had to keep the eggs warm and rear his own Owlets."
"You can imagine how glad he was on the night when he first heard them tapping on the inside of their shells, for then he knew that he would soon be free to hunt."
"A finer pair of children were never hatched, and their father thought them far ahead of all his other broods. ""If only Mrs. Owl were here to see them, how lovely it would be!"" he said. Yet if she had been there he would never have had the pleasure of hearing their first faint cheeps, and of covering them with his soft breast feathers as he did each day. He forgot now all the weary time when he sat with aching legs, wishing that his cousin would happen along with something to eat. For that is always the way, when we work for those we love, the weariness is soon forgotten and only happiness remains."
"It is said that the Screech Owl was more thoughtful of his wife after his cousin had to hatch the eggs, and it is too bad that some of the other forest people could not have learned the same lesson; but the Great Horned Owl never told, and the Screech Owl kept his secret, and to this day there are many people in the forest who know nothing whatever about it."
THE SWAGGERING CROW
"When the Crows who have been away for the winter return to the forest, all their relatives gather on the tree-tops to welcome them and tell the news. Those who have been away have also much to say, and it sometimes seems as though they were all talking at once. They spend many days in visiting before they begin nest-building. Perhaps if they would take turns and not interrupt each other, they would get the news more quickly, for when people are interrupted they can never talk well."
"Sometimes, too, one hungry fellow will fly off for a few mouthfuls of grain, and get back just in time to hear the end of a story. Then he will want to hear the first part of it, and make such a fuss that they have to tell it all over again just for him."
"At this time in the spring, you can hear their chatter and laughter, even when you are far away; and the song-birds of the forest look at each other and say, ""Dear me! The Crows are back."" They have very good reasons for disliking the Crows, as any Robin will tell you."
"There was one great shining black Crow who had the loudest voice of all, and who was not at all afraid to use it. This spring he looked very lean and lank, for it had been a long, cold winter, and he had found but little to eat, acorns, the seeds of the wild plants, and once in a great while a frozen apple that hung from its branch in some lonely orchard."
"He said that he felt as though he could reach around his body with one claw, and when a Crow says that he feels exceedingly thin. But now spring was here, and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, yes, and his brothers and his uncles, too, had returned to the forest to live. He had found two good dinners already, all that he could eat and more too, and he began to feel happy and bold. The purple gloss on his feathers grew brighter every day, and he was glad to see this. He wanted to look so handsome that a certain Miss Crow, a sister of one of his friends, would like him better than she did any of the others."
"That was all very well, if he had been at all polite about it. But one day he saw her visiting with another Crow, and he lost his temper, and flew at him, and pecked him about the head and shoulders, and tore the long fourth feather from one of his wings, besides rumpling the rest of his coat. Then he went away. He had beaten him by coming upon him from behind, like the sneak that he was, and he was afraid that if he waited he might yet get the drubbing he deserved. So he flew off to the top of a hemlock-tree where the other Crows were, and told them how he had fought and beaten. You should have seen him swagger around when he told it. Each time it was a bigger story, until at last he made them think that the other Crow hadn't a tail feather left."
"The next day, a number of Crows went to a farm not far from the forest."
Miss Crow was in the party. On their way they stopped in a field where there stood a figure of a man with a dreadful stick in his hand.
"Everybody was frightened except Mr. Crow. He wanted to show how much courage he had, so he flew right up to it. They all thought him very brave. They didn't know that down in his heart he was a great coward. He wasn't afraid of this figure because he knew all about it. He had seen it put up the day before, and he knew that there was no man under the big straw hat and the flapping coat. He knew that, instead of a thinking, breathing person, there was only a stick nailed to a pole. He knew that, instead of having two good legs with which to run, this figure had only the end of a pole stuck into the ground."
"Of course, he might have told them all, and then they could have gathered corn from the broken ground around, but he didn't want to do that. Instead, he said, ""Do you see that terrible great creature with a stick in his hand? He is here just to drive us away, but he dares not touch me. He knows I would beat him if he did."" Then he flew down, and ate corn close beside the figure, while the other Crows stood back and cawed with wonder."
"When he went back to them, he said to Miss Crow, ""You see how brave I am. If I were taking care of anybody, nothing could ever harm her."" And he looked tenderly at her with his little round eyes. But she pretended not to understand what he meant, for she did not wish to give up her pleasant life with the flock and begin nest-building just yet."
"When they reached the barn-yard, there was rich picking, and Mr. Crow made such a clatter that you would have thought he owned it all and that the others were only his guests. He flew down on the fence beside a couple of harmless Hens, and he flapped his wings and swaggered around until they began to sidle away. Then he grew bolder (you know bullies always do if they find that people are scared), and edged up to them until they fluttered off, squawking with alarm."
"Next he walked into the Hen-house, saying to the other Crows, ""You might have a good time, too, if you were not such cowards."" He had no more than gotten the words out of his bill, when the door of the Hen-house blew shut and caught there. It was a grated door and he scrambled wildly to get through the openings. While he was trying, he heard the hoarse voice of the Crow whom he had beaten the day before, saying, ""Thank you, we are having a fairly good time as it is""; and he saw Miss Crow picking daintily at some corn which the speaker had scratched up for her."
"At that minute the great Black Brahma Cock came up behind Mr. Crow. He had heard from the Hens how rude Mr. Crow had been, and he thought that as the head of the house he ought to see about it. Well! one cannot say very much about what happened next, but the Black Brahma Cock did see about it quite thoroughly, and when the Hen-house door swung open, it was a limp, ragged, and meek-looking Crow who came out, leaving many of his feathers inside."
"The next morning Mr. Crow flew over the forest and far away. He did not want to go back there again. He heard voices as he passed a tall tree by the edge of the forest. Miss Crow was out with the Crow whom he had beaten, and they were looking for a good place in which to build. ""I don't think they will know me if they see me,"" said Mr. Crow, ""and I am sure that I don't want them to."""
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER CHILDREN
Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker bent her handsome head down and listened.
"""Yes, it is! It certainly is!"" she cried, as she heard for a second time the faint ""tap-tap-tap"" of a tiny beak rapping on the inside of an egg shell. She hopped to one side of her nest and stood looking at the four white eggs that lay there. Soon the rapping was heard again and she saw one of them move a bit on its bed of chips."
"""So it is that one,"" she cried. ""I thought it would be. I was certain that I laid that one first."" And she arched her neck proudly, as the beak of her eldest child came through a crack in the shell. Now nobody else could have told one egg from another, but mothers have a way of remembering such things, and it may be because they love their children so that sometimes their sight is a little sharper, and their hearing a little keener than anybody else's."
"However that may be, she stood watching while the tiny bird chipped away the shell and squeezed out of the opening he had made. She did not even touch a piece of the shell until he was well out of it, for she knew that it is always better for children to help themselves when they can."
"It makes them strong and fits them for life. When the little Red-headed Woodpecker had struggled free, she took the broken pieces in her beak and carried them far from the nest before dropping them to the ground."
"If she had done the easiest thing and let them fall by the foot of the hollow tree where she lived, any prowling Weasel or Blue Jay might have seen them and watched for a chance to reach her babies. And that would have been very sad for the babies."
"The newly hatched bird was a tired little fellow, and the first thing he did was to take a nap. He was cold, too, although the weather was fine and sunshiny. His down was all wet from the moisture inside the egg, and you can imagine how he felt, after growing for so long inside a warm, snug shell, to suddenly be without it and know that he could never again have it around him. Even if it had been whole once more, he could not have been packed into it, for he had been stretching and growing every minute since he left it. It is for this reason that the barn-yard people have a wise saying: ""A hatched chicken never returns to his shell."""
"When Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker came back, she covered her shivering little one with her downy breast, and there he slept, while she watched for her husband's coming, and thought how pleased and proud he would be to see the baby. They were a young couple, and this was their first child."
"But who can tell what the other three children, who had not cracked the shell, were thinking? Could they remember the time when they began to be? Could they dream of what would happen after they were hatched? Could they think at all? They were tiny, weak creatures, curled up within their shells, with food packed all around them. There had been a time when they were only streaks in the yellow liquid of the eggs. Now they were almost ready to leave this for a fuller, freer life, where they could open their bills and flutter their wings, and stretch their legs and necks. It had been a quiet, sheltered time in the shell; why should they leave it? Ah, but they must leave it, for they were healthy and growing, and when they had done so, they would forget all about it. By the time they could talk, and that would be very soon, they would have forgotten all that happened before they were hatched. That is why you can never get a bird to tell you what he thought about while in the egg."
"After the young Woodpecker's three sisters reached the outside world, the father and mother were kept busy hunting food for them, and they were alone much of the time. It was not long before they knew their parents' voices, although, once in a while, before they got their eyes open, they mistook the call of the Tree Frog below for that of the Woodpeckers. And this was not strange, for each says, ""Ker-r-ruck!"
"Ker-r-ruck!"" and when the Tree Frog was singing in his home at the foot of the tree, the four Woodpecker children, in their nest-hollow far above his head, would be opening their bills and stretching their necks, and wondering why no juicy and delicious morsel was dropped down their throats."
"When they had their eyes open there was much to be seen. At least, they thought so. Was there not the hollow in their dear, dry old tree, a hollow four or five times as high as they could reach? Their mother had told them how their father and she had dug it out with their sharp, strong bills, making it roomy at the bottom, and leaving a doorway at the top just large enough for them to pass through. Part of the chips they had taken away, as the mother had taken the broken shells, and part had been left in the bottom of the hollow for the children to lie on. ""I don't believe in grass, hair, and down, as a bed for children,"" their father had said. ""Nice soft chips are far better."""
"And the Woodpecker children liked the chips, and played with them, and pretended that they were grubs to be caught with their long and bony tongues; only of course they never swallowed them."
"It was an exciting time when their feathers began to grow. Until then they had been clothed in down; but now the tiny quills came pricking through their skin, and it was not so pleasant to snuggle up to each other as it had once been. Now, too, the eldest of the family began to show a great fault. He was very vain. You can imagine how sorry his parents were."
Every morning when he awakened he looked first of all at his feathers.
"Those on his breast were white, and he had a white band on his wings."
"His tail and back and nearly the whole of his wings were blue-black. His head, neck, and throat were crimson. To be sure, while the feathers were growing, the colors were not very bright, for the down was mixed with them, and the quills showed so plainly that the young birds looked rather streaked."
"The sisters were getting their new suits at the same time, and there was just as much reason why they should be vain, but they were not. They were glad (as who would not be?) and they often said to each other: ""How pretty you are growing!"" They looked exactly like their brother, for it is not with the Woodpeckers as with many other birds, the sons and daughters are dressed in precisely the same way."
"As for the vain young Woodpecker, he had many troubles. He was not contented to let his feathers grow as the grass and the leaves grow, without watching. No indeed! He looked at each one every day and a great many times every day. Then, if he thought they were not growing as fast as they should, he worried about it. He wanted to hurry them along, and sometimes, when his sisters did not seem to be looking, he took hold of them with his bill and pulled. Of course this did not make them grow any faster and it did make his skin very sore, but how was he to know? He had not been out of the shell long enough to be wise."
"It troubled him, too, because he could not see his red feathers. He twisted his head this way and that, and strained his eyes until they ached, trying to see his own head and neck. It was very annoying. He thought it would have been much nicer to have the brightest feathers in a fellow's tail, where he could see them, or at any rate on his breast; and he asked his mother why it couldn't be so."
"""I once knew a young Woodpecker,"" she said, ""who thought of very little but his own beauty. I am afraid that if he had been allowed to wear his red feathers in his tail, he would never have seen anything else in this wonderful great world, but just his own poor little tail."" She looked out of the doorway as she spoke, but he knew that she meant him."
"Things went on in this way until the children were ready to fly. Then there were daily lessons in flying, alighting, clinging to branches, and tapping for food on the bark of trees. They learned, too, how to support themselves with their stiff tails when they were walking up trees or stopping to eat with their claws hooked into the bark. Then Mrs."
"Red-headed Woodpecker taught them how to tell the ripest and sweetest fruit on the trees before they tasted it. That is something many people would like to know, but it is a forest secret, and no bird will tell anyone who cannot fly."
"It was on his way back from an orchard one day, that the vain young Woodpecker stopped to talk with an old Gray Squirrel. It may be that the Gray Squirrel's sight was not good, and so he mistook the Woodpecker for quite another fellow. He was speaking of an old tree where he had spent the last winter. ""I believe a family of Red-headed Woodpeckers live there now,"" he said. ""I have met them once or twice. The father and mother are fine people, and they have charming daughters, but their son must be a great trial to them. He is one of these silly fellows who see the world through their own feathers."""
"As the young Red-headed Woodpecker flew away, he repeated this to himself: ""A silly fellow, a silly fellow, who sees the world through his own feathers."" And he said to his father, ""Whose feathers must I look through?"""
"This puzzled his father. ""Whose feathers should you look through?"" said he. ""What do you mean?"""
"""Well,"" answered the son, ""somebody said that I saw the world through my own feathers, and I don't see how I can get anybody else's."""
"How his father did laugh! ""I don't see why you should look through any feathers,"" said he. ""What he meant was that you thought so much of your own plumage that you did not care for anything else; and it is so. If it were intended you should look at yourself all the time, your eyes would have been one under your chin and the other in the back of your head."
"The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, “Thou shalt not have him! Thou shalt not have him!” The maiden thought that the child Mary who stood by her mother Anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, “Fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak!”"
140 Domestic Servants
"“Whither goest thou?” “To Walpe.” “I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
"“Hast thou a man? What is his name?” “Cham.” “My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a child; how is he styled?” “Wild.” “My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a cradle? How callest thou thy cradle?”"
"“Hippodadle.” “My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
“Hast thou also a drudge? what name has thy drudge?”
"“From-thy-work-do-not-budge.” “My drudge, From-thy-work-do-not-budge:"
"my child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.”"
141 The Lambkin and the Little Fish
"There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts. Their own mother was, however, dead, and they had a step-mother, who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out."
"“Eneke Beneke, let me live, And I to thee my bird will give."
"The little bird, it straw shall seek, The straw I’ll give to the cow to eat."
"The pretty cow shall give me milk, The milk I’ll to the baker take."
"The baker he shall bake a cake, The cake I’ll give unto the cat."
"The cat shall catch some mice for that, The mice I’ll hang up in the smoke, And then you’ll see the snow.”"
"They stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him. As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry. And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb. Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass. Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. The false step-mother thought, “This is a good opportunity,” and called the cook and said to him, “Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.” Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently. When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the kitchen-sink and looking up at him. This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house; then the lamb cried down to it,"
"“Ah, brother, in the pond so deep, How sad is my poor heart!"
Even now the cook he whets his knife To take away my tender life.”
"The little fish answered,"
"“Ah, little sister, up on high How sad is my poor heart While in this pond I lie.”"
"When the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house. Then said he, “Be easy, I will not kill thee,” and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard."
"The peasant was, however, the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman. Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy."
142 Simeli Mountain
"There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement."
"While he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away."
"When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow."
"And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother’s possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him, “What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure?” “Corn and barley,” said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures."
"When he came to the mountain he cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.” The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, “Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.” That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out, “Bird, have we caught thee at last! Didst thou think we had never noticed that thou hadst been in here twice? We could not catch thee then; this third time thou shalt not get out again!” Then he cried, “It was not I, it was my brother,” but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off."
143 Going A-Travelling
"There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, “How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee.” Then said the son, “I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, Not much, not much, not much.”"
"So he walked for a long time and always said, “Not much, not much, not much.” Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, “God speed you! not much, not much, not much.” “What sayst thou churl, ‘not much?’” And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish."
"So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, “Hast thou never seen me threshing?” “What ought I to say, then?” asked the youth."
"""Quite,"" said the Princess. ""I only wish I were half as sure that he wouldn't hurt you."""
"""My Princess,"" he said tenderly, ""two great powers are on our side: the power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than anything else in the world."""
"So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and he gave a cry of rage and it was like twenty engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station."
"And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any number of them far too many so that it looked like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as bayonets."
"""Good-bye, love!"" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward the sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm."
"The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet and the very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam."
"Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer, and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to know when to pull the rope."
"On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the tide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge."
"Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy it turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life and the tide began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island."
"But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him."
"""Now, there's only the griffin,"" said Nigel. And the Princess said:"
"""Yes only "" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial and next day she said to Nigel: ""You know a griffin is half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea."""
So they talked it over and arranged everything.
"When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the Princess cried: ""Look out! There's a lion behind you."""
"And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished, exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats."
"""Poor griffin,"" said the Princess, ""it was very good at the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered."""
"At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long."
"When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as many times as was good for them, the witch said: ""Well, but what about the whirlpools?"""
"And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: ""I'm not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide."""
"So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as smooth as glass."
"The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some good after all."
"When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as long as was good for them."
"The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady from her lover."
"I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do."
THE DRAGON TAMERS]
VI. The Dragon Tamers
"There was once an old, old castle it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where."
"Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs."
"John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole."
"And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat."
"Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head. “Look here,” he said at length, “it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear—I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig; at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.”"
"The good Hans was terrified. “Goodness!” he said, “help me out of this fix; you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.” “I shall risk something at that game,” answered the lad, “but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.” So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path."
"The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm. “When I think over it properly,” said he to himself, “I have even gained by the exchange; first there is the good roast-meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers; I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be!”"
"As he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow; as his wheel whirred he sang—"
"“I sharpen scissors and quickly grind, My coat blows out in the wind behind.”"
"Hans stood still and looked at him; at last he spoke to him and said, “All’s well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding.” “Yes,”"
"answered the scissors-grinder, “the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?”"
"“I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.”"
“And the pig?”
“That I got for a cow.”
“And the cow?”
“I took that instead of a horse.”
“And the horse?”
“For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.”
“And the gold?”
"“Well, that was my wages for seven years’ service.”"
"“You have known how to look after yourself each time,” said the grinder. “If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.”"
"“How shall I manage that?” said Hans. “You must be a grinder, as I am; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here; it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose; will you do it?”"
"“How can you ask?” answered Hans. “I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, what need I trouble about any longer?” and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange. “Now,” said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, “here is a strong stone for you into the bargain; you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully.”"
"Hans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart; his eyes shone with joy. “I must have been born with a caul,” he cried; “everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child.”"
"Meanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute; the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then."
"He crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water. When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favour also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him."
"“There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I,” he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home."
84 Hans Married
"There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife. He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot. Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, “Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back.” “Yes,” said Hans, “I will do all that.” Then the wooer put on a pair of old patched trousers, went to a rich peasant’s daughter in the next village, and said, “Won’t you marry my nephew Hans—you will get an honest and sensible man who will suit you?” The covetous father asked, “How is it with regard to his means? Has he bread to break?” “Dear friend,” replied the wooer, “my young nephew has a snug berth, a nice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he has quite as many patches as I have,” (and as he spoke, he slapped the patches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also.) “If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said.” Then the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said, “If that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the marriage.”"
"So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom’s property, Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, “I might spoil my good coat.” Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock-frock, and said, “That patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it,” meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own."
"“Were you indeed at the wedding?” “Yes, indeed I was there, and in full dress. My head-dress was of snow; then the sun came out, and it was melted. My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns which tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I pushed against a stone and they said, “Klink,” and broke in two."
85 The Gold-Children
"There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth. But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold. As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said, “Hark you, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.” Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat?” The gold fish continued, “That shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire.” “If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favour.” “Yes,” said the fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over.” Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home. But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said, “Husband, how has all this come to pass? It suits me very well.” “Yes,” said the man, “it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat.” Said the wife, “But I have got nothing and don’t know where to find anything in this new house.” “There is no need of your knowing,” said the man, “for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it.” When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect."
"Then the woman cried joyfully, “What more can you want, my dear?” and they sat down, and ate and drank together. When they had had enough, the woman said, “But husband, whence come all these riches?” “Alas,”"
"answered he, “do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.” “Very good,” said she, “if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.” However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty. And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman’s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish. “Listen,” said the fish, “if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life’s sake don’t reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!” “I will take good care,”"
"answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut. “Now you have got what you want,”"
"While watching the immense destruction of these insects we were startled by the outbreak of the thunderstorm high up on the mountains, but far above the peals of thunder rose the terrible sound of rushing water. Animals now came tearing out of the lowlands too terrified to notice whither they went, so that I stood ready, gun in hand, in case any of the dangerous kind should try to seek an asylum on my particular hill; but with the exception of a huge wild boar, who had to be shot as he charged up the slope, all took refuge elsewhere."
"Soon the water burst through the river bank, spreading over the country, sweeping down the tall grass jungle and surging and roaring round our hill. Packing all that was valuable in small parcels, we gathered them in a heap, hoping that the flood would subside ere it reached the building. All round about large trees, uprooted by the terrible force of the deluge, were swept along, several animals vainly trying to keep a footing among their roots and branches. At last the water reached the steps of the house; so, pulling our boat close up, we stepped in with what we could save and hung to the wooden posts of the building, vainly trusting that the worst had come; but it was not so, for we soon had to leave go the post and pass the boat's rope round a tree. The water then rushed in, the house toppled over, and it and its contents were swept away by the flood."
"In a short time the tree began to shake and bend, so we knew that it was being uprooted; therefore, letting go the rope, we launched forth upon the seething waste of waters and were whirled away. Onward we rushed through masses of logs, branches, the remains of houses, and such like wreck, having to be very careful that our frail vessel did not get upset or crushed. Twice we made for the tops of hills that showed themselves above water, but on approaching them we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals."
"Here a tiger crouched on a branch of a tree, seemingly too much alarmed at his perilous position to molest the half-dozen deer that crowded timidly together right underneath his perch. Up above him the smaller branches were stocked with monkeys, who looked very disconsolate at their enforced imprisonment. As we swept past, the tiger raised his head, gave a deep growl and showed his teeth, then crouched down again as if fully aware of his helplessness, and we had too much to think of ourselves to interfere with him."
"Gaining the open country, the scene was one of desolation; but the current was not so strong, so we turned round, seeing the flood was going down, and by nightfall we had got back to where the house had stood. Every vestige of the once pretty homestead had disappeared, with sheep and cattle, though the fowls had managed to find a roost on the topmost branches of some orange trees, which alone remained to mark the spot."
"As the moon rose, the mountaineers came down from the villages, and, embarking on rafts and in canoes, went round the different hills, shooting and spearing the animals that had swum there; and truly the sight of such a hunting scene was an exciting one. Here a stout stag, defending himself with his antlers as best he might against the spearsmen, kept up a gallant fight till death."
"The tiger we had seen in the morning took to swimming, and on being wounded with a spear turned on the nearest canoe, upsetting the hunters into the water, where a desperate encounter took place; but he was eventually dispatched by a blow from an ax not, however, before he had clawed some of his pursuers most severely."
"At daylight the water had entirely gone down, and a thick, muddy deposit covered all the lowland, while an immense number of snakes, scorpions, and other unpleasant creatures lay dead in all directions, upon which and the drowned animals vultures, crows and kites were feeding."
Queen Margaret and the Robbers.
There were once two kings of England at the same time. One was Henry VI.
"He was the rightful king, but a very weak and feeble man, and quite unfit to rule his kingdom."
"The other was young Edward, Duke of York, called Edward IV. He was made king by some of the nobles, who grew weary of Henry and his foolish deeds."
"A number of the English people were faithful to King Henry, but many others went over to King Edward's side, and there were quarrels between the two parties, which ended in a war. This war was called the War of the Roses, because the followers of Henry wore a red rose as their badge, and Edward's friends wore a white one."
"In one battle, fought at Hexham, the White Roses beat the Red ones, and King Henry was taken prisoner and sent to the Tower of London. His wife, Queen Margaret, with her little son, Prince Edward, escaped after the battle, and hid themselves in a wild forest. As they wandered among the trees, seeking some place where they might be safe from their enemies, they met a band of robbers. These rough men took away the queen's money and her jewels, tearing her necklace from her neck, and her rings from her fingers. Then they began to dispute as to who should have most of the stolen goods. And while they quarrelled, Queen Margaret took her little boy by the hand and ran away to a thick part of the wood. There they stayed until the angry voices of the robbers could no longer be heard, and then, in the growing darkness, they came stealthily from their hiding-place. They wandered on, knowing not where to go, hoping much to meet some of their friends, and fearing still more to be found by their enemies, the soldiers of the White Rose. But, alas! they saw no kind face, and night came on. Then, as they crept fearfully from tree to tree, they met another robber."
"The poor queen was much afraid that this robber, who looked very fierce, would kill her and the prince, because she had no riches left to give him. In despair she threw herself upon her knees before him, and said:"
"""My friend, this is the son of your king. I give him into your care."""
"The robber was much surprised to see the queen and the prince alone, with their clothes torn and stained, and their faces white from hunger and fatigue. But he was a kindhearted man, although his looks were rough, and before he became a robber he had been a follower of King Henry, so he was quite willing to do his best for the little prince. He took the boy in his arms, and led the way to a cave in the forest, where he lived with his wife. And in this poor shelter, the queen and her son stayed for two days, listening to every sound, and fearing that their enemies would find them. On the third day, however, the friendly robber met some of the lords of the Red Rose in the forest, and led them to the cave. The queen and prince were overjoyed to see their friends, and soon they escaped with them to a place of safety."
"Their hiding-place has been called ""Queen Margaret's Cave"" ever since that time. If you go to Hexham Forest, you will be able to see it."
William Caxton
"In old days, books were not printed as they are now; they were written by hand. This took a long time to do, so there were not many books, and they were so dear that only the rich could buy them."
"But after a time, some clever men made a machine, called a printing-press, which could print letters."
"About that time, an Englishman, named William Caxton, lived in Holland, and copied books for a great lady. He says his hand grew tired with writing, and his eyes became dim with much looking on white paper. So he learned how to print, and had a printing-press made for himself, which he brought to England. He set it up in a little shop in London, and then he began to print books. He printed books of all sorts tales, and poetry, and history, and prayers, and sermons. In the time which it had formerly taken him to write one book, he could now print thousands."
"All sorts of people crowded to his shop to see Caxton's wonderful press; sometimes the king went with his nobles. Many of them took written books with them, which they wished to have put into print. Some people asked Caxton to use in his books the most curious words he could find; others wished him to print only old and homely words. Caxton liked best the common, simple words which men used daily in their speech."
"Caxton did a very good thing when he brought the printing-press to England, for, after that, books became much cheaper, so that many people could buy them, and learning spread in the land."
Sir Philip Sidney
"When Elizabeth was Queen of England it was a time of great deeds and great men. The queen was brave and clever herself, so she liked to have brave and clever people around her. Great soldiers, and writers, and statesmen went to her court; and when brave seamen came back from their voyages to unknown lands far away, they were invited by the queen to visit her, and tell her of all the strange places and people they had seen. In this Elizabeth was wise, for men did their best to show themselves worthy of her favours."
"Among all the great men at court, none was more beloved than Sir Philip Sidney. He was called ""the darling of the court""."
"At that time, there was much trouble and many wars in some other countries, where people were fighting for the right to worship God in their own way. Philip Sidney heard of these things when he was a boy in his father's house, and his heart was stirred with pity. Later, when he was in France, a great number of people were cruelly killed because they would not pray in the way which the king ordered. Sidney never forgot the dreadful sights and sounds of that sad time, and when Queen Elizabeth sent an army to help the people of Holland, who were fighting for their freedom, he asked for leave to go with it. This was granted to him, and he was made one of the leaders."
"One eye, sleepest thou?”"
"until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, “One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.” So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”"
"Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, “This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.” So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.” But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.” Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?”"
"but then, instead of singing,"
"“Three eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,"
"“Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"and sang all the time,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?"
"Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.” And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, “Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.” Then the envious mother cried, “Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead."
"When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears."
"Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, “Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?” “Have I not reason to weep?” she answered. “The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.” The wise woman said, “Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.” Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, “Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don’t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.” Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you can have it.” So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do."
"Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, “Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.”"
"One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, “Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.” One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, “I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.” The sisters cried, “You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?” But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly."
"It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. “Quick, Two-eyes,” cried the two sisters, “creep under this, and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.” Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.” They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-eyes, come forth.” Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.” “Yes,” replied Two-eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight."
"Then said the knight, “Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?”"
"“Alas!” answered Two-eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.” So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father’s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart’s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. “The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?” But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her."
"Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth."
The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

"pointed, scriggly hand, ""To my little friend.--E. H.""  Fiorsen drew smoke"
"deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.  He"
"opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette"
"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for
"once and saw what she really did--Went, and offered her his escort home!"
"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.
Chopin!  The polonaise in A flat.  Good!  Could that be Gyp?  Very good!
"He moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly"
turned the handle.  The music stopped.  He went in.
"changing slowly."""
"""Nay, the Queen herself will never change!"" cried Wylde, with an"
"emphatic gesture.  ""The Duchess has changed, and she seeks to use her"
"influence with the Queen to make her change also, and give up her Tory"
advisers altogether.  But she will not succeed.  The Queen may be timid
"and gentle, but she has all her father’s tenacity and obstinacy.  Let my"
Lady of Marlborough look to it!  She may strain the cord to breaking
"point.  Already they say that the new favourite, Mrs. Masham, is ousting"
"her kinswoman, the Duchess, from the foremost place in the Queen’s"
affections.  Favourites have fallen ere this through too great
"arrogance.  The victories of Ramillies and Oudenarde, and the successes"
"that have followed, make the Duke the idol of the nation and the"
"favourite of the Queen yet; but the day may come when this may change,"
"and then the high Tories may come in once more with a rush."""
"""I should be sorry for the Duke to lose favour,"" spoke Grey"
"thoughtfully.  ""I did see him once, and had speech with him after the"
"battle of Ramillies, and a more gracious and courtly gentleman it has"
"never been my lot to meet."""
Suddenly the Old Lion’s eyes flashed fire.
"""You have seen and had speech with the Duke on the field of Ramillies?"
"You saw the battle, or something of it?  Speak!  Tell me all!  I must"
"hear this tale.  It may mean much to us both."""
"""In sooth it is little I can tell you of the battle, for I was in the"
thick of it myself.  It was by accident that my servant and I came upon
the rival armies; and another happy accident gave me the chance of doing
"a small service for the Duke.  After the battle, when we were hard by"
"Louvain, he called me to him, and spoke many gracious words. I would"
"plate. She fears--"""
"_Von G._: ""I understand! We have a dr-r-eadful reputation, we poor"
Germans! The French stuff you up with lies. But we are better than
you think. You shall take them in two--three days to Brussels when
"things are quiet, and put them in some bank. Here I fear I must"
stay. I must intrude myself on your hospitality. But better for you
perhaps if I stay here at present. I will put a few of my men in
your--your--buildings. Most of them shall go with their officers to
"Tervueren for billet."" (Turning to Mrs. Warren.) ""Madam, you must"
cheer up. I foresee your daughter and I will be great friends. Let
us now look through the rooms and see what disposition we can make.
"I think I will have to take this room for my writing, for my work. I"
"see you have telephone here. _Gut_!"""
"Leaving Mrs. Warren still seated, but a little less stertorous in"
"breathing, a little reassured, Vivie and Oberst von Giesselin then"
"went over the Villa, apportioning the rooms. The Colonel and his"
orderly would be lodged in two of the bedrooms. Vivie and her mother
would share Mrs. Warren's large bedroom and retain the salon for
their exclusive occupation. They would use the dining-room in common
with their guest.
"Vivie looking out of the windows occasionally, as they passed from"
"room to room, saw the remainder of the soldiery strolling off to be"
"lodged at their nearest neighbour's, the farmer who had driven them"
"in to Brussels that morning. There were perhaps thirty, accompanying"
"a young lieutenant. How would he find room for them, poor man? They"
were more fortunate in being asked only to lodge six or seven in
"addition to the Colonel's orderly and soldier-clerk. Before sunset,"
"the Villa Beau-séjour was clear of soldiers, except the few that had"
gone to the barn and the outhouses. The morning room had been fitted
"on French money, told the Abbé that he hoped to see him, with his"
"credentials, at Whitehall on the second morning following at ten o'clock,"
"and the Abbé said he would leave his credentials with my Lord Clarendon,"
"and would be at Whitehall at the hour suggested by the king, for the"
purpose of making the French king's offer.
"Most of the guests went home between two men, very late at night, but"
fortunately I was able to walk home by myself.
I was both glad and disappointed not to find George in the gown of the
Abbé. I was glad because of the risk he would have taken had he come to
"England, yet disappointed in missing what would have been the most"
"picturesque, daring personal exploit of English court history. But on the"
whole it was better as it was.
"The next morning the king sent for me to come to his closet, and asked if"
"I knew one Lilly, an astrologer. I answered that I knew little of him"
"personally, but had heard much of his wisdom and learning."
"""Yes, yes, but you know where he lives, do you not? On the Strand, a"
"dozen houses this side of Temple Bar?"" asked the king."
"""I have seen the house often, your Majesty,"" I replied."
"""Good! Now listen attentively to what I have to say,"" returned the king,"
graciously taking my arm and leading me to a window overlooking the
"river. ""I hear from De Grammont that the Abbé du Boise is a firm believer"
"in the teachings of astrology. I want you to arrange, without letting any"
"one know that my finger is in the pie, to take Lilly to see the Abbé, or"
the Abbé to see Lilly. I'll whisper a word in your ear. The stars will
"tell our friend, the Abbé, a story to suit our purposes. The French king"
"and his ambassadors will find their match in me, I warrant you. I have"
feel their knuckles against her.  Had he gone mad?  Would he strangle
"her?  But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his"
"hands dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door."
Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
"""Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!"""
"Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering.  They heard"
"the front door slam.  Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in"
"her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments"
"of bewildered anger.  Even into that back yard, summer had crept.  The"
leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little
"patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was"
basking.  The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a
side street.  She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very
"still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion"
of compunction and anger.  That kind and harmless old man--to be so
insulted!  This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages!  She
"would never forgive him this!  For he had insulted her as well, beyond"
"what pride or meekness could put up with.  She turned, and, running up to"
"the old man, put both her hands into his."
"""I'm so awfully sorry.  Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall"
"come on Friday!""  And, before he could stop her, she was gone."
"She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the"
"other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her.  She"
shook herself free and walked swiftly on.  Was he going to make a scene
"in the street?  Again he caught her arm.  She stopped dead, faced round"
"on him, and said, in an icy voice:"
"""Why are they sending you away?"" asked Vivie drily, compelled to"
interest herself in his affairs since they so closely affected her
own and her mother's.
"""Because of this,"" said von Giesselin, nearly in tears, pulling from"
"a small portfolio a press cutting. ""Do you remember a fortnight ago"
"I told you some one, some Belgian had written a beautiful poem and"
sent it to me for one of our newspapers? I showed it to you at the
"time and you said--you said 'it was well enough, but it did not seem"
"to have much point.'"" Vivie did remember having glanced very"
perfunctorily at some effusion in typewriting which had seemed
unobjectionable piffle. She hadn't cared two straws whether he
"accepted it or not, only did not want to be too markedly"
indifferent. Now she took it up and still read it through
"uncomprehendingly, her thoughts absent with the fate of Miss Cavell."
"""Well! what is all the fuss about? I still see nothing in it. It is"
just simply the ordinary sentimental flip-flap that a French
"versifier can turn out by the yard."""
"""It is _far_ worse than that! It is a horrible--what the French"
"call 'acrostiche,' a deadly insult to our people. And I never saw"
"it, the Editor never saw it, and you, even, never guessed its real"
"meaning![1] The original, as you say, was in typewriting, and at the"
bottom was the name and address of a very well-known homme de
lettres: and the words: 'Offert à la rédaction de l'Ami de L'Ordre.'
"He say now, _never never_ did he send it. It was a forgery. When we"
came to understand what it meant all the blame fall on me. I am sent
"back to the Army--I shall be killed before Verdun, so good-bye dear"
Miss--We have been good friends. Oh this War: this d-r-r-eadful
War--It has spoilt everything. Now we can never be friends with
"England again."""
Is _Alice in Wonderland?_  Is _Treasure Island?_  These are
"masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how"
much more pleasure when we are grown-up.  In any case what do we mean
"by ""children""?  A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of"
fourteen--are they all to like the same thing?  And is a book
"""suitable for a boy of twelve"" any more likely to please a boy of"
twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;
"even if the novel be described truly as ""suitable for a man of"
"thirty-seven""?  I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult"
problems.
But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which
"children will like, unless he write it for himself first.  That being"
"so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups.  How"
grown-up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown
reader a few weeks after its first publication; a letter which said
"that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser, Mr. Lloyd"
"George and Mr. Asquith, but he could not be sure which of the"
characters were meant to be Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law.
Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard?  I replied that they were
thinly disguised on the title-page as Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.  In
"fact, it is not that sort of book."
"But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what"
sort of book it is.  Perhaps no explanation is necessary.  Read in it
what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like;
"it can only fall into one of two classes.  Either you will enjoy it,"
or you won't.
It is that sort of book.
A. A. Milne.
"""Oh, no, we shan't,"" I remarked calmly, for I had moved to a position"
"of tactical advantage on the Marine's port beam. ""We will have the"
"story here, if you don't mind, Dawson."""
"He stamped pettishly on the floor, whipped off his cap, and spun it"
"across the room. ""Confound you, Mr. Copplestone!"" he growled. ""How"
"the--how the--do you do it?"" He could not think of an expletive mild"
"enough for Mrs. Cary's ears. ""There's something about me that I can't"
"hide. What is it? If you don't tell, I will get you on the Regulation"
compelling all British subjects to answer questions addressed to them
"by a competent naval or military authority."""
"""You don't happen to be either, Dawson,"" said I unkindly. ""And,"
"beside, there was never yet a law made which could compel a man to"
"speak or a woman to hold her tongue. Some day perhaps, if you are"
"good, I will show you how the trick is done. But not yet. I want to"
have something to bargain with when you cast me into jail. Out with
"the story; we are impatient. If I mistake not, you come to us Dawson"
"triumphant. You haven't the air of a broken man."""
"""I have been successful,"" he answered gravely, ""but I am a long, long"
"way from feeling triumphant. No, thank you, Mrs. Cary, I have had my"
"breakfast, but if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Many"
"thanks."""
"Dawson sat down, and Cary moved about inspecting him from every angle."
"""No,"" declared he at last, ""I cannot see the smallest resemblance, not"
the smallest. You were thin; now you are distinctly plump. Your hair
was nearly white. Your cheeks had fallen in as if your back teeth were
"missing. Your lower lip stuck out."" Dawson smiled, highly gratified."
"""I took in all my people at the office this morning,"" he said. ""They"
"Geraldine, honour me by accepting my escort.—Grey, will you join us?"""
"He spoke the last words over his shoulder, and there was a note in his"
"voice which the young man had never heard before, and which he did not"
"fully understand.  It seemed to sting him, but he knew not why."
"""I thank you—no,"" he answered.  ""I am going home."""
And then he stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the fair
"Geraldine, who threw him one strange, half-appealing glance over her"
"shoulder, but spoke no word of farewell."
"Grey had meant to go home, but somehow he could not bring himself to do"
"so.  His brain seemed on fire, and his heart with it.  He knew not what"
"ailed him, but a fever was consuming him.  He left the gardens, but"
"walked on and on, not knowing or caring whither he went.  The night was"
"far spent, and the dawn was beginning to blush in the eastern sky,"
before he found himself in the region of Sandford House again.
The place was still and deserted.  The revellers and roisterers seemed
"all at home.  A watchman dozed at his post, thankful for the peace of"
"the streets, and Grey met no interruption, till suddenly, round a"
"corner, he came face to face with his host, who gave him a look, uttered"
"a short laugh, and linked his arm within his."
"""Well met, friend Grey!  You too have had no desire to woo the somnolent"
"god?  We find metal more attractive elsewhere.  Say now, what think you"
of the future Lady Sandford?  Methought you had eyes but for her
to-night.  Will she not queen it right royally here—the beautiful
"stately creature? You have taste, Grey, and I am well pleased that you"
"have.  Those painted, patched, and powdered Jezebels, smirking and"
"ogling and running all over the town for the adulation of the crowd, are"
"blowed ter bits. Oh, it's 'ard when yer've bin together all the time an'"
"shared everythink."""
He buried his face in his hands and made no further sound except an
occasional sniff and a hasty drawing in of the breath through trembling
lips.
"""It's bloody murder up the line,"" said a full Corporal. ""We were in a"
trench four feet deep and up to our waist in water. A Jerry sniper
"spotted us and one man got biffed, [killed] and then the next, and then the"
next all along the trench. We were packed together like sardines and had
no cover at all for our heads and shoulders. I got the wind up terribly
'cause I knew my turn was coming. He only gave me a Blighty though--I
"reckon I'm bloody lucky!"""
"""We was ready for to go over the top an' waitin' for the whistle to"
blow. We didn't 'alf 'ave the wind up. You could 'ear the teeth
"chatterin' all along the trench. I was shiverin' all over, I...."""
"""Next man!"" The conversation stopped while the next man went across, but"
"having once begun to tell their experiences, the men would not stop"
"altogether, and after a brief silence an elderly little man with a"
bandaged foot said:
"""What I couldn't get over was insomnia. I could never sleep at the"
right time and I was always dead tired on duty. Once I worked
forty-three hours at a stretch and after that I had to do a guard in our
trench. I felt sleepy all of a sudden. I pinched myself and banged the
"butt of my rifle on my toes, but everything seemed to swim round me."
"Then, I don't know how, I went off to sleep. I was awakened by an"
officer who shook me and swore at me. I was a bit dazed at first and
then suddenly it struck me what had happened. I never had the wind up so

"Dex shuddered; and a low moan came from Greca, whose clear blue eyes"
had rested on the contents of this vast room before in her capacity as
hostage and interpreter for the inhuman Rogans.
And now another sense of Dex's began to register perception on his
brain.
"A peculiar odor came to his nostrils. It was a musky, fetid odor, like"
"that to be smelled in an animal cage; but it was sharper, more acrid"
"than anything he had ever smelled on Earth. It smelled--ah, he had"
it!--_reptilian_. As though somewhere nearby a dozen titanic serpents
were coiled ready to spring!
"Looking about, Dex saw a six-foot square door of bars in one wall of"
"They travelled next day, reaching London at half-past two.  Betty had"
gone up in the early morning to prepare the way.  The dogs had been with
Aunt Rosamund all this time.  Gyp missed their greeting; but the
installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be
"the nursery, absorbed all her first energies.  Light was just beginning"
"to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and"
"crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her ten weeks'"
"absence.  What a wintry garden!  How different from that languorous,"
"warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow"
"of the dark trees.  How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey,"
"darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower!  She glanced"
"back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her"
"room and in the nursery, and someone just drawing the curtains.  Now that"
"the leaves were off, one could see the other houses of the road, each"
"different in shape and colour, as is the habit of London houses. It was"
"being like a chest of drawers, or pigeon holes to hold the dead. Tufts"
of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.
"In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The"
"dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of"
"graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,"
with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly
"strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,"
"that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the"
"south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out"
by the dryness.
"""I like it! I like it!"" cries the q-b."
"""But could you live here?"" She would like to say yes, but daren't."
We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag
arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but
"peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a"
"sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white"
cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and
magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the
fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it
cost? Forty-five francs.
There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and
"go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of"
"the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called"
Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.
"Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,"
"pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the"
"platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,"
"And the people answered her, and told her who it was. And when she"
"heard, she fell down upon the road as one dead: for it was her father"
"and mother who had died yesterday, and it was their funeral train that"
"she saw. They were all dead now, husband and sons and father and mother;"
in all the world she was quite alone.
"So she went mad, for her trouble was more than she could bear. She threw"
"off all her clothes, and let down her long hair and wrapped it about her"
"naked body, and walked about raving."
"At last she came to where the Buddha was teaching, seated under a"
"fig-tree. She came up to the Buddha, and told him of her losses, and how"
she had no one left; and she demanded of the Buddha that he should
restore to her those that she had lost. And the Buddha had great
"compassion upon her, and tried to console her."
"'All die,' he said; 'it comes to everyone, king and peasant, animal and"
man. Only through many deaths can we obtain the Great Peace. All this
"sorrow,' he said, 'is of the earth. All this is passion which we must"
"get rid of, and forget before we reach heaven. Be comforted, my"
"daughter, and turn to the holy life. All suffer as you do. It is part of"
"our very existence here, sorrow and trouble without any end.'"
"But she would not be comforted, but demanded her dead of the Buddha."
"Then, because he saw it was no use talking to her, that her ears were"
"deaf with grief, and her eyes blinded with tears, he said to her that he"
would restore to her those who were dead.
"'You must go,' he said, 'my daughter, and get some mustard-seed, a pinch"
"of mustard-seed, and I can bring back their lives. Only you must get"
this seed from the garden of him near whom death has never come. Get
"most ""un-Spanish"" characteristic."
"It is true that, as Buckle argues, the many earthquakes in Spain"
tended to promote superstitious fear; but then on his principles
"the Dutch seafaring habits, and the constant risks and frequent"
"disasters of inundation, had the same primary tendency. For the"
"rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish"
"civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol."
"ed. p. 550) that Spanish ""loyalty"" was abnormal and continuous from"
the period of the first struggles with the Moors. As to this see
"the present writer's notes in the 1-vol. ed. of Buckle, as cited."
"Even Ferdinand, as an Aragonese, was disrespectfully treated by the"
"Castilians (cp. Armstrong as cited, pp. 5, 31, etc.; De Castro,"
"_History of Religious Intolerance in Spain_, Eng. tr. 1853, pp. 40,"
41); and Philip I and Charles V set up a new resistance. An alien
dynasty could set up disaffection in Spain as elsewhere.
"It should be noted, finally, that the stiff ceremonialism which is"
held to be the special characteristic of Spanish royalty was a
"Burgundo-Teutonic innovation, dating from Philip I, and that even"
"in the early days of Philip the Cortes petitioned ""that the"
household of the Prince Don Carlos should be arranged on the old
"Spanish lines, and not in the pompous new-fangled way of the House"
"of Burgundy"" (Major Hume's _Spain_, p. 127). Prescott (_Philip II_,"
"ed. cited, pp. 655, 659) makes the petition refer to the king's own"
"household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive"
"expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his"
"household was ""as great as would be required for the conquest of a"
"kingdom."" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against"
"bull-fights, which appear to have originated with the Moors, were"
"strongly opposed by Isabella the Catholic, and were much encouraged"
"by the Teutonic Charles V (U.R. Burke, _History of Spain_, 1895,"
was simply the train of thought aroused which struck Bainbridge
unpleasantly. He felt Schaeffer to be capable of almost any villainy
provided it could be accomplished with safety to himself. The
"humiliation of that fight, too, had added a powerful incentive to the"
one already offered by Crane and the Lumber Trust for the eclipse of Bob
Bainbridge. And a total eclipse would be so easy! Just a single shot
fired from the bushes at a moment when there was no one else about to
see or hear. In this wild country the chances of escaping were infinite.
The man might not even be suspected.
"Bob suddenly moved his shoulders impatiently, frowned, and turned away."
A moment later his eyes twinkled mirthfully.
"“Another minute and I’d have the undertaker picked out,” he chuckled."
"“The scoundrel hasn’t the common courage to do murder. All the same,” he"
"added, with a decisive squaring of the shoulders, “I’ll put a crimp in"
"his little game about those records. I’ll have cookee scrape ’em all up,"
"and ship the whole bunch down to John. That clerk, Wiggins, can put ’em"
"together, I’ll bet! Patience is his middle name--patience and picture"
"puzzles. We’ll have the laugh on Pete, after all--hanged if we won’t!”"
CHAPTER IX. IN THE SWIFT CURRENT
"The clumsy, slow-moving scow loaded with the cook’s outfit and a supply"
"of bedding followed the drive downstream, and, that night, fastened up"
"to the bank close to the inlet of Deer Pond, the middle one of three"
small bodies of water strung along the length of the Megantic. It was a
"full day’s work, much better than Bainbridge had hoped for, and, as he"
approached the big drying fire flaming up at one side of the camp made
"by Charlie Hanley, the cook, Bob shook his own hand in silent, grinning"
self-congratulation. He knew that they were far from being out of the
its way as Trafalgar. It proved that the whole German Fleet could not
fight out an action against our full force and have the smallest hope
of success. I am just praying for the chance of a whack at them in the
"_Malplaquet_. My destroyer was a bonny ship, the best in the flotilla,"
"but the _Malplaquet_ is a real peach. You should see her."""
"""We mean to,"" said Cary. ""This very afternoon. You shall take us back"
"with you."""
"The Commander opened his eyes at this cool proposal, but we prevailed"
"upon him to seek the permission of the Admiral-Superintendent, who, a"
"good deal to my surprise, proved to be quite pliable. Cary's"
reputation for discretion must be very high in the little village
where he lives if it is able to guarantee so disreputable a scribbler
"as Bennet Copplestone! The Admiral, fortunately, had not read any of"
my Works before they had been censored. When printed in _Cornhill_
they were comparatively harmless.
I must not describe the _Malplaquet_. Her design was not new to me--I
had seen more than one of her type--but as she is now a unit in
Beatty's Fleet her existence is not admitted to the world. As we went
"up and down her many steep narrow ladders, and peered into dark"
"corners, I looked everywhere for a Marine sentry whom I could identify"
"by mark of ear as Dawson. I never saw him, but Trehayne passed me"
"twice, and I found myself again admiring his splendid young manhood."
"He was not big, being rather slim and wiry than strongly built, but in"
"sheer beauty of face and form he was almost perfectly fashioned. ""Do"
"you know that man?"" I asked of our commander, indicating Trehayne."
"""No,"" said he. ""He is one of the shore party. But I should like to"
have him with me. He is one of the smartest looking petty officers
"that I have ever seen."""
"The mail arranged, Trude sat back in the cushions of a great wicker"
chair and with a long breath of delight enjoyed the beauty around her.
Each day Edgeacres enraptured her anew and roused in her a wonder as to
"why it should be her lot to be there. ""It ought to be Vick or Issy,"""
"she would apologize to the nodding flowers or to Mitie, the yellow"
warbler.
And as might be expected Trude had found innumerable ways of making
herself useful to Mrs. White as an expression of her gratitude. There
"were telephone calls she could answer, letters she could write,"
"shopping she could do, ordering, she even conferred with old Pepper and"
"Jonathan, the gardener. She drove with Mrs. White in the afternoon and"
served tea to the callers who flocked to the house from the nearby
summer hotels.
"""I do not know how I ever got along without you, my dear,"" Mrs. White"
"had said more than once. ""What do you do to make yourself so"
invaluable? It seems as though just to look at you one leans on you!
Even Pepper is saying 'Miss Trude thinks this and Miss Trude thinks
"that--'"""
"Her benevolent interest in her husband's wards, a certain pride in"
"saying to her friends: ""My husband, you know, is looking after the"
"daughters of Joseph Romley, who was a college friend of his,"" had grown"
"into a real fondness for Trude. ""I have never appreciated the dear girl"
"when she's been with us before,"" she declared to her husband. ""I"
"suppose it was because we were in town, then, and I was too busy to get"
"acquainted with her. Why, she's really pretty. And she makes such a"
slave of herself to her sisters! She hasn't any life of her own. I
"don't believe they appreciate it, either. It's a shame she doesn't"
"marry some nice young man--"" Mrs. White's kind always found virtue's"
"thorns? If we could gather the flowers and find no thorns, we should not"
"care for them. The more the thorns, the more valuable the blossoms.'"
"So they said, and they gathered the blossoms, and they faded. But the"
thorns did not fade; they were ever there. The more blossoms a man had
"gathered, the more thorns he had to wear, and Time was ever behind him."
"They wanted to rest in the glades, but Time willed that ever they must"
"go forward; no going back, no rest, ever and ever on. So they grew very"
weary.
"'These flowers,' they said at last, 'are always the same. We are tired"
of them; their smell is heavy; they are dead. This forest is full of
thorns only. How shall we escape from it? Ever as we go round and round
"we hate the flowers more, we feel the thorns more acutely. We must"
"escape! We are sick of Time and his whip, our feet are very, very weary,"
"our eyes are dazzled and dim. We, too, would seek the Peace. We laughed"
at those before who went along the rocky path; we did not want peace;
but now it seems to us the most beautiful thing in the world. Will Time
never cease to drive us on and on? Will these lights _never_ cease to
flash to and fro?'
Each man at last will turn to the straight road. He will find out. Every
"man will find out at last that the forest is hateful, that the flowers"
"are deadly, that the thorns are terrible; every man will learn to fear"
Time.
"Then, when the longing for peace has come, he will go to the straight"
way and find it; no man will remain in the forest for ever. He will
"learn. When he is very, very weary, when his feet are full of thorns,"
"and his back scarred with the lashes of Time--great, kindly Time, the"
schoolmaster of the world--he will learn.
"valuables, slung them somehow on her left arm, while with her other"
she piloted the nearly swooning Mrs. Warren into the court.
They were at once stopped by a non-commissioned officer who asked
"them in abrupt, scarcely understandable German what they wanted."
Vivie guessing his meaning said in English--she scarcely knew any
"German: ""This is our house. We have been absent in Brussels. We want"
"to see the officer in command."" The soldier knew no English, but"
likewise guessed at their meaning. He ordered them to wait where
they were. Presently he came out of the Villa and said the Herr
Oberst would see them. Vivie led her mother into the gay little
hall--how pleasant and cool it had looked in the early morning! It
was now full of surly-looking soldiers. Without hesitating she took
"a chair from one soldier and placed her mother in it. ""You rest"
"there a moment, dearest, while I go in and see the officer in"
"command."" The corporal she had first spoken with beckoned her into"
the pretty sitting-room at the back where they had had their early
breakfast that morning.
Here she saw seated at a table consulting plans of Brussels and
"other papers a tall, handsome man of early middle age, who might"
"indeed have passed for a young man, had he not looked very tired and"
"care-worn and exhibited a bald patch at the back of his head,"
rendered the more apparent because the brown-gold curls round it
"were dank with perspiration. He rose to his feet, clicked his heels"
"together and saluted. ""An English young lady, I am told, rather ..."
"a ... surprise ... on ... the ... outskirts ... of Brussels..."" (His"
"English was excellent, if rather staccato and spaced.) ""It ... is"
... not ... usual ... for ... Englishwomen ... to ... be owners ...
of chateaux ... in Belgium. But I ... hear ... it ... is ... your
"mother ... who is the owner ... from long time, and you are her"
daughter newly arrived from England? Nicht wahr? Sie verstehen nicht
"of hesitation.  ""When we were lovers in the old days I was, as you know,"
"a pure, honest, upright woman, with thoughts only for my God and for"
"yourself.  But I am that no longer.  I am unworthy your love, Gerald.  I"
"am unfit to be your wife, and can never be--never!"" and she threw"
"herself upon the couch near by and burst into a flood of tears, while I"
stood there rigid as a statue.
CHAPTER ELEVEN.
DEANE SPEAKS HIS MIND.
An hour later I was seated in my room at the Embassy staring blankly at
"the blotting-pad before me, utterly perplexed and bewildered.  I loved"
"Yolande--nay, she was my idol; nevertheless she had firmly refused to"
allow me to resume my place at her side.  At one moment it seemed to me
as though she had actually made a sacrifice for my sake; yet at another
I could not help regarding both her and her mother with distinct
suspicion.  My love's strange words were in themselves a sufficient
self-condemnation.  Her service as a political agent had been secured by
"one or other of the Powers--France, I suspected; and, to put it plainly,"
she was a spy!
This knowledge had come upon me like a thunderbolt.  Of all the women I
had known and least suspected of endeavouring to learn the secrets of
"our diplomacy, Yolande was certainly the chief.  The events which had"
culminated in her accepting this odious office were veiled in mystery.
Why had she done this?  Who had tempted her or forced her to it?
"Those tears of hers, when she had made confession, were the tears of a"
"woman in the depths of despair and degradation, and I, loving her so"
"fondly, could not but allow my heart to go forth in sympathy.  There was"
an affinity between us that I knew might some day prove fatal.
"Netherlands. ""The engrained habit of municipal isolation,"" says"
"one, ""was the cause why the general liberties of the Netherlands"
"were imperilled, why the larger part of the country was ultimately"
"ruined, and why the war of independence was conducted with so much"
"risk and difficulty, even in the face of the most serious perils"""
"(Thorold Rogers, _Holland_, p. 26. Cp. pp. 35, 43; Motley, pp. 29,"
"30, 43; Grattan, pp. 39, 50, 51). Van Kampen avows (_Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 131) that throughout the Middle Ages Friesland was"
unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden
"refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would"
advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening
of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime
"(Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii)."
"As regards the early factions of the ""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish"" in"
"the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians"
are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)
"represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the"
"party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,"
"noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or"
"of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is"
"supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the"
"Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of"
"the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a"
class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor
"_Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180."
"Thus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,"
the cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs
"when the latter were in straits, as in the famous case of the ""Great"
"Privilege"" extorted from the Duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold"
"who don't worry about Tom, Dick, or Harry, but choose an Orestes at"
"least for their tormenting; so that, when they give up their pursuit"
"of a Risca, he may excusably regard it as a personal slight. It was the"
morose and gloomy nature of the man.
"“I know I 'm a fool,” he said to Herold, when every one had gone to bed,"
“but I can't help it. Any normal person would regard me as insane if
I told him I was stopped from saving the wreck of my career by
consideration for the temporary comfort of a bedridden chit of a girl
"half my age, who is absolutely nothing to me in the world (her uncle"
"married my first cousin. If that is anything of a family tie, I'm weak"
on family feeling); but that's God's truth. I'm tied by her to this
"accursed country. She just holds me down in the hell of London, and I"
"can't wriggle away. It's senseless, I know it is. Sometimes when I 'm"
"away from her, walking on the beach, I feel I 'd like to throw the whole"
of this confounded house into the sea; and then I look up and see the
"light in her room, and--I--I just begin to wonder whether she 's asleep"
and what she's dreaming of. There 's some infernal witchcraft about the
child.”
"“There is,” said Herold."
"“Rot!” said Risca, his pugnacious instincts awakened by the check on"
his dithyrambics. “The whole truth of the matter is that I'm simply a
sentimental fool.”
"“All honour to you, John,” said Herold."
"“If you talk like that, I 'll wring your neck,” said Risca, pausing for"
"à second in his walk up and down Sir Oliver's library, and glaring down"
"at his friend, who reclined on the sofa and regarded him with a smile"
"exasperatingly wise. “You know I'm a fool, and why can't you say it? A"
friends and forget all about the army and the war. I would be gay and
"frivolous and go to theatres, music-halls and cafés. And one day I would"
spend in the British Museum and lose myself in books--that would be
"just like old times! Of course, our leave would not last for ever and"
the return journey would be terrible. No doubt the fortnight would pass
"very quickly, but I determined to enjoy every single hour with"
"deliberation and understanding, and to squeeze every drop of pleasure"
out of it. How many hours were there in a fortnight? More than three
"hundred! Many would be wasted in sleep, but still, there would be many"
"left and by dwelling upon each one, the fortnight would seem an age."
*       *       *       *       *
An afternoon and an evening in a train that travelled all too slowly. A
night and half a day at Calais Rest Camp. How terrible was the rankling
impatience that gnawed our hearts as the hours dragged on.
"But at last we were on the leave boat. There was another long delay, and"
"then, with a feeling of immense relief, we heard the engines throb and"
the paddle-wheels begin to turn. I looked overboard and saw white foam
hissing along the surface of water rapidly widening between us and the
quay.
Seventeen months of exile and slavery had come to an end and before us
lay a wonderful fortnight of freedom and happiness. And at the end of
the fortnight? There was no need to think of that now.
The sea was blue and smooth and a cool breeze was blowing. We saw the
cliffs of England grow larger and larger. Soon we were able to
"distinguish the town of Dover, the houses clustered round the harbour,"
and the Castle up on the cliff. It was there that I had begun my career
as a soldier more than two years before. How much had happened since
Eilert and I followed to my room.
*       *       *       *       *
"As a matter of fact, I went out again with Eilert at once. He had a great"
"deal to tell me and explain to me, and I was not unwilling to listen to"
"him then. Really, Eilert was not too bad, a fine fellow with four ragged,"
"magnificent youngsters by his first wife, who had died two years before,"
"and another child by his second wife. He must have forgotten, as he told"
"me this, the yarn about the sick wife and the ailing children that he had"
spun for me last winter. The girl who had come down the stairs with the
"message from the ""missis"" was no servant, but Eilert's young wife. And"
"she, too, was all right--strong and good, handy about the stables, and"
pregnant again.
"It all looks good to me, Eilert: your wife and everything you tell me"
about your family.
"No one will understand my strange contentment, then; I had been full of an"
obscure happiness from the moment I came to this house. Probably a mere
"coincidence, but that did not detract from my satisfactory state of mind;"
"I was pleased with everything, and all things added to my cheerful frame"
"of mind. There were some pigs by the barn, very affectionate pigs, because"
they were used to the children playing with them and kissing them and
"riding on their backs. And there was one of the goats, up on the roof of"
"course, standing so far out along the edge that it was a wonder he didn't"
"grow dizzy. Seagulls flew criss-cross over the fields, screaming their"
"own language to one another, and being friends or enemies to the best of"
"their ability. Down by the mouth of the river, just beneath the sunset,"
began the great road that winds up through the woods and the valley. There
is something of the friendliness of a living being about such a forest
"on the one side, and accuracy on the other. The true Fairy Tale should"
be unhampered by any compromise of probability even--the scientific
representation should be sufficiently marvellous along its own lines to
need no supernatural aid. Both appeal to the imagination in different
ways.
"As an exception to this kind of mixture, I should quote “The Honey Bee,"
"and Other Stories,” translated from the Danish of Evald by C. G. Moore"
Smith. There is a certain robustness in these stories dealing with the
"inexorable laws of Nature, though some of them will appear hard to the"
child; but they will be of interest to all teachers.
Perhaps the worst element in choice of stories is that which insists
upon the moral detaching itself and explaining the story. In “Alice in
"Wonderland” the Duchess says, “‘And the moral of _that_ is: Take care"
of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ‘How fond
"she is of finding morals in things,’ thought Alice to herself.” (This"
gives the point of view of the child.)
"The following is a case in point, found in a rare old print in the"
British Museum:
“Jane S. came home with her clothes soiled and hands badly torn. ‘Where
"have you been?’ asked her mother. ‘I fell down the bank near the mill,’"
"said Jane, ‘and I should have been drowned if Mr. M. had not seen me"
and pulled me out.’ 'Why did you go so near the edge of the brink?‘
"'There was a pretty flower there that I wanted, and I only meant to"
"take one step, but I slipped and fell down.’ Moral: Young people often"
"take but one step in sinful indulgence (Poor Jane!), but they fall"
into soul-destroying sins. There is a sinful pleasure which they wish
to enjoy. They can do it by a single act of sin (the heinous act of
"picking a flower!). They do it; but that act leads to another, and they"
"told Sir Oliver to go to the devil with his lugubrious and rotten game,"
and dashed away to the solitude of the beach until the luncheon-bell
summoned him back.
"“I'm going by the 3:50,” said he at the luncheon-table."
At three o'clock Stella was free to see him again. He went up to her
room distinctly determined to shut his heart against folly. The sun
had crept round toward the west and flooded the head and shoulders of
"Stellamaris and the dainty bedspread with pale gold, just as it flooded"
the now still and smiling sea. Again paralysis fell upon John. The words
"he was to speak were to him, as well as to her, the words of doom, and"
"he could not utter them. They talked of vain, childish things. Then"
Stellamaris's clock chimed the three-quarters. There are some chimes
"that are brutal, others ironic; but Stellamaris's chimes (the clock was"
"a gift from John himself) were soft, and pealed a soothing mystery, like"
a bell swung in a deep sea-cave.
"It was a quarter to four, and he had missed his train once more. Well,"
"the train could go to--to London, as good a synonym for Tophet as any"
"other. So he stayed, recklessly surrendering himself to the pale, sunlit"
"peace of the sea-chamber, till he was dislodged by Lady Blount."
An attempt to catch a six o'clock train was equally unsuccessful. He did
not return to town that night. Why should a sorely bruised man reject
"the balm that healed? To-morrow he would be stronger and more serene,"
"abler to control the driving force of the Furies, and therefore fitted"
to announce in gentler wise the decrees of destiny. So Risca went to bed
"and slept easier, and the room which Stellamaris had made for him became"
the enchanted bower of a Fair Lady of All Mercy.
In their simple human way Sir Oliver and Lady Blount besought him to
maintain a mission of its own in Congoland. Kind Mme. Trouessart
"(née Walcker), distressed and unusually moved at the sad"
"circumstances of Mrs. Warren's death, had called in her uncle the"
Baptist pastor (who also in some unexplained way seemed to hold a
brief for the Salvation Army). He prayed silently by the death-bed
"which, under the circumstances, was more tactful than open"
intercession. He helped greatly over all the formalities of the
"funeral, and he took upon himself the arrangement of the ceremony,"
"so that everything was done decorously, and certainly to the"
"satisfaction of the Belgians, who attended. Such people would be"
"large-minded in religion--you might be Protestant, if you were not"
"Catholic, or you might be Jewish; but a funeral without some outward"
sign of faith and hope would have puzzled and distressed them.
"To Vivie's great surprise, there was a considerable attendance at"
the ceremony. She had expected no more than the company of Minna--an
"unprofessing but real Christian, if ever there were one, and the"
equally Christian if equally hedonist Mme. Trouessart. But there
"came in addition quite a number of shopkeepers from the Rue Royale,"
"the Rues de Schaerbeek, du Marais, de Lione, and de l'Association,"
"with whom Mrs. Warren had dealt in years gone by. ""C'etait une dame"
"_très_ convenable,"" said one purveyor, and the others agreed. ""Elle"
"me paya écus sonnants,"" said another, ""et toujours sans"
"marchander."" There was even present a more distinguished"
acquaintance of the past: a long-retired Commissaire de Police of
the Quartier in which Mrs. Warren's hotel was situated.
"He appeared in the tightly-buttoned frock-coat of civil life, with a"
"minute disc of some civic decoration in his button hole, and an"
incredibly tall chimney-pot hat. He came to render his _respectueux
hommages_ to the maîtresse-femme who had conducted her business
"within the four corners of the law, ""sans avoir maille à partir avec"
"This wood was never quite dark, it was so full of these lights that"
flickered aimlessly.
There were men in this wood who wandered to and fro. The wood was full
of them.
They did not know whither they went; they did not know whither they
"wished to go. Only this they knew, that they could never keep still;"
"for the keeper of this wood was Time. He was armed with a keen whip, and"
kept driving them on and on; there was no rest.
"Many of these when they first came loved the wood. The glades, they"
"said, were very beautiful, the flowers very sweet. They wandered down"
"the broad roads into the glades, and tried to lie upon the moss and love"
the flowers; but Time would not let them. Just for a few moments they
"could have peace, and then they must on and on. But they did not care."
"'The forest is full of glades,' they said; 'if we cannot live in one, we"
"can find another.' And so they went on finding others and others, and"
each one pleased them less.
Some few there were who did not go to the glades at all. 'They are very
"beautiful,' they said, 'but these roads that pass through them, whither"
do they lead? Round and round and round again. There is no peace there.
"Time rules in those glades, Time with his whip and goad, and there is no"
"peace. What we want is rest. And those lights,' they said, 'they are"
"wandering lights, like the summer lightning far down in the South,"
moving hither and thither. We care not for such lights. Our light is
firm and clear. What we desire is peace; we do not care to wander for
"ever round this forest, to see for ever those shifting lights.'"
"And so they would not go down the winding roads, but essayed the path"
"upon the cliffs. 'It is narrow,' they said, 'it has no flowers, it is"
"'You loved her so much,' I said. 'She was such a good wife to you."
Surely you would like to live with her again.'
"'But all that,' she replied, 'was in a former life.'"
Now she loved only her present father and mother. The last life was like
"a dream. Broken memories of it still remained, but the loves and hates,"
"the passions and impulses, were all dead."
Another little boy told me once that the way remembrance came to him was
"by seeing the silk he used to wear made into curtains, which are given"
"to the monks and used as partitions in their monasteries, and as walls"
to temporary erections made at festival times. He was taken when some
"three years old to a feast at the making of a lad, the son of a wealthy"
"merchant, into a monk. There he recognised in the curtain walling in"
part of the bamboo building his old dress. He pointed it out at once.
This same little fellow told me that he passed three months between his
death and his next incarnation without a body. This was because he had
"once accidentally killed a fowl. Had he killed it on purpose, he would"
have been punished very much more severely. Most of this three months he
"spent dwelling in the hollow shell of a palm-fruit. The nuisance was, he"
"explained, that this shell was close to the cattle-path, and that the"
lads as they drove the cattle afield in the early morning would bang
with a stick against the shell. This made things very uncomfortable for
him inside.
It is not an uncommon thing for a woman when about to be delivered of a
"baby to have a dream, and to see in that dream the spirit of someone"
"asking for permission to enter the unborn child; for, to a certain"
"extent, it lies within a woman's power to say who is to be the life of"
her child.
"""Lady, you have asked a hard question, inasmuch as I know but little of"
"the man, albeit I have lived with him above a month.  He attracts me,"
and yet there be moments when he repels me too.  He is a good friend—I
would not speak a word against him; yet it is said that he can be a
bitter and an unscrupulous enemy; and those who have lost his favour
"withdraw themselves as speedily as possible from his notice, fearful"
"lest some evil may befall them."""
"""Is he then cruel and rancorous?"""
"""I can believe that he might be, were his passions roused.  He has that"
forceful nature which tends to vehement liking and bitter hatred.  I
"have experienced the one; I have not tasted of the other.  For the rest,"
"he is a man of parts, and can do all well to which he puts his hand."
Methinks he would be strong enough to break off his reckless and vicious
"habits, had he but motive sufficient to make him! desire to do so.  But"
"for the nonce he floats with the current, and lives as the world lives."
"More I cannot say."""
"At that moment a swift, firm tread was heard approaching along the dim"
"alley; and Geraldine looked hastily round, her hand dropping from Grey’s"
arm.
"""It is he!"" she whispered, and there was a catch in her voice which the"
"young man heard without understanding.  He faced round, and beheld the"
towering figure of Lord Sandford beside them.
"""Well chanced upon!"" quoth he in his resonant tones.  ""I was sent by"
"your mother in search of you, Lady Geraldine.  The court of beauty has"
sat.  To her has been adjudged the prize.  She now desires the presence
"of her daughter, to share her triumph. We shall sup anon, and the table"
will not be complete without one gracious and lovely presence. Lady
"upon you."""
"""Your remarks, Cary,"" I observed, ""are deficient in tact. You might,"
"at least, pretend to believe that my personal charm has won for me"
"Dawson's affection. As a matter of fact, he cares not a straw for my"
_beaux yeux_; his motives are crudely selfish. He thinks that it is in
"my power to contribute to the greater glory of Dawson, and he"
cultivates me just as he would one of his show chrysanthemums. He has
"done me the honour to appoint me his biographer extraordinary."""
"""I am sure you are wrong,"" cried Cary. ""He was most frightfully angry"
about that story of ours in _Cornhill_. He demanded from me your name
"and address, and swore that if I ever again disclosed to you official"
secrets he would proceed against me under the Defence of the Realm
"Act. He was a perfect terror, I can assure you."""
"""And yet he always carries that story about with him in his"
breast-pocket; he has summoned me here to see him at his work; and you
have been commanded to tell me everything which you know! My dear
"Cary, do not be an ass. You are too simple a soul for this rather"
"grubby world. In your eyes every politician is an ardent,"
"disinterested patriot, and every soldier or sailor a knightly hero of"
"romance. Human beings, Cary, are made in streaks, like bacon; we have"
"our fat streaks and our lean ones; we can be big and bold, and also"
very small and mean. Your great man and your national hero can become
"very poor worms when, so to speak, they are off duty. But I didn't"
"come here, at great inconvenience, to talk this sort of stuff at"
midnight. Go ahead; give me the details of this sabotage case which is
baffling Dawson and the naval authorities; let me hear about the
"cutting of those electric wires."""
"""It is, as I told you, in my note, a queer business. The _Antinous_, a"
"determining to get on, but uneasy at the expense, for monetary conditions"
"were ever more embarrassed. At home, she practised steadily and worked"
hard at composition. She finished several songs and studies during the
"spring and summer, and left still more unfinished.  Monsieur Harmost was"
"tolerant of these efforts, seeming to know that harsh criticism or"
"disapproval would cut her impulse down, as frost cuts the life of"
"flowers.  Besides, there was always something fresh and individual in her"
things.  He asked her one day:
"""What does your husband think of these?"""
Gyp was silent a moment.
"""I don't show them to him."""
She never had; she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she
"composed, dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves,"
"and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself,"
"frail enough plant already.  The only person, besides her master, to whom"
she confided her efforts was--strangely enough--Rosek.  But he had
"surprised her one day copying out some music, and said at once: ""I knew."
"I was certain you composed.  Ah, do play it to me!  I am sure you have"
"talent.""  The warmth with which he praised that little ""caprice"" was"
"surely genuine; and she felt so grateful that she even played him others,"
"and then a song for him to sing.  From that day, he no longer seemed to"
"her odious; she even began to have for him a certain friendliness, to be"
"a little sorry, watching him, pale, trim, and sphinx-like, in her"
"drawing-room or garden, getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his"
"desire.  He had never again made love to her, but she knew that at the"
least sign he would.  His face and his invincible patience made him
pathetic to her.  Women such as Gyp cannot actively dislike those who
admire them greatly.  She consulted him about Fiorsen's debts.  There
"after the summer of 1915, she lived very much alone, except that she"
had the Adams children from Marylebone to spend the day with her
occasionally.
"Poor Mrs. Adams, though a valiant worker, was very downcast and"
unhappy. She confided to Mrs. Rossiter that although she dearly
"loved her Bert--""and a better husband I defy you to find""--he never"
"seemed all hers. ""Always so wrapped up in that Miss Warren or 'er"
"cousin the barrister."" And no sooner had war broken out than off he"
"was to France, as a kind of missionary, she believed--the Young"
"Men's Christian Something or other; ""though before the War he didn't"
"seem particular stuck on religion, and it was all she could do to"
get him sometimes to church on a Sunday morning. Oh yes: she got 'er
money all right; and she couldn't say too much of Mr. and Mrs.
"Rossiter's kindness. There was Bert, not doin' a stroke of work for"
"the Professor, and yet his pay going on all the same. Indeed she was"
"putting money by, because Bert was kep' out there, and all found."""
However his two pretty children were some consolation to Mrs.
"Rossiter, whom they considered as a very grand lady and one that was"
lavishly kind.
Mrs. Rossiter tried sometimes in 1915 having working parties in her
house or in the studio; and if she could attract workers gave them
such elaborate lunches and plethoric teas that very little work was
"done, especially as she herself loved a long, aimless gossip about"
the Royal Family or whether Lord Kitchener had ever _really_ been in
"love. Or she tried, since she was a poor worker herself--her only"
jersey and muffler were really finished by her maid--reading aloud
"to the knitters or stitchers, preferably from the works of Miss"
Charlotte Yonge or some similar novelist of a later date. But that
was found to be too disturbing to their sense of the ludicrous. For
"defined attributes--like the ""Putois"" of Anatole France. Dawson and"
"""Bailey""; they are both ""nice men"" and little Jane's friends; she is"
"sure of them, and I expect that she is right. Children always are"
right.
"Dawson, after his outburst, glowered at me for a moment and then"
"laughed. ""I am a man,"" said he, ""though you may not think it, and I"
have my weaknesses. But I never give way to them when they interfere
"with business. Menteith is in my grip, and he won't get out of it. But"
he is a poor creature. He handed over the description of the
"_Rampagious_, saw it hidden in the sardine tin, and was ordered to"
take the food parcel to the Post Office. The German agent who used him
had no notion of risking his own skin. Then followed the discovery and
the arrest of the draughtsman who had drawn the plan. Those who had
seduced Menteith forbade him to come near them. They slipped away into
hiding--which profited them little since all of them were on our
string--after threatening Menteith that he would be murdered if he
"gave himself up to the police, as in his terror he seemed to want to"
"do. When nothing happened for two weeks, the vermin came out of their"
"holes, made up the last parcel, and forced Menteith to go to Carlisle"
"in order to post it. All through he has been the most abject of tools,"
and received nothing except the four pounds and various small sums
"spent in drinks."""
"""You have the principal all right?"""
"""Yes, I have him tight. The others associated with him I shall leave"
free; they will be most useful in future. They don't know that we know
"them; when they do know, their number will go up, for they will be"
"then of no further use to us. It is a beautiful system, Mr. Copplestone,"
"and you have had the unusual privilege of seeing it at work."""
Prussia. How he had loved England in the days when he was military
"attaché there. He had once wanted to marry an Englishwoman, a Miss"
"Fraser, a so handsome daughter of a Court Physician."
"""Why, that must have been Honoria, my former partner,"" said Vivie,"
finding an intense joy in this link of memory. And she told much of
"her history to the sentimental Colonel, who was conceiving for her a"
sincere friendship and camaraderie. They opened up other veins of
"memory, talked of Lady Feenix, of the musical parties at the Parrys,"
"of Emily Daymond's playing, of this, that and the other hostess, of"
such-and-such an actress or singer.
The Colonel of course was often absent all day on military duties.
He advised Vivie strongly on such occasions not to go far from Mrs.
"Warren's little domain. ""I am obliged to remind you, dear young"
"lady, that you and your mother are my prisoners in a sense. Many bad"
things are going on--things we cannot help in war--outside this
"quiet place..."""
"In November, however, there was a change of scene, which in many"
ways came to Vivie and her mother with a sense of great relief.
Colonel von Giesselin told them one morning he had been appointed
"Secretary to the German Governor of Brussels, and must reside in the"
town not far from the Rue de la Loi. He proposed that the ladies
should move into Brussels likewise; in fact he delicately insisted
on it. Their pleasant relations could thus continue--perhaps--who
"knows?--to the end of this War, ""to that peace which will make us"
"friends once more?"" It would in any case be most unsafe if, without"
"his protection, they continued to reside at this secluded farm, on"
"the edge of the great woods. In fact it could not be thought of, and"
another officer was coming here in his place with a considerable
suite. Eventually compensation would be paid to Mrs. Warren for any
"which these occasioned"" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited"
"of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). ""It was only tanners, dyers, and"
apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the
"Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had"
"similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much"
"too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76)."
It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was
Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and
that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages
"""nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in"
"the Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most"
"zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even"
"bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott"
"(_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders"
"""claimed freedom of thought as their birthright"" is a gratuitous"
"absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of ""race"
"types,"" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and"
"persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the"
established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's
side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair
"hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs"
"(see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his"
"descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was"
"markedly ""Spanish"" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his"
reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a
"""Teutonic"" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of"
"rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that ""the"
Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have
"evaporated."" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great"
"portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a ""typical"" Teuton; and the"
"stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a"
"soul, possessed him,--and the comprehension of Christ's Sacrifice was"
"no longer a mystery! Yet he was so certain that death, sudden and"
"speedy closely, awaited him that he seemed to feel it in the very"
"air,--not like a coming chill of dread, but like the soft approach of"
some holy seraph bringing benediction. It mattered little to him that
"he was actually in the very plenitude of health and strength,--that"
perhaps in all his life he had never felt such a keen delight in the
"physical perfection of his manhood as now,--death, without warning and"
"at a touch, could smite down the most vigorous, and to be so smitten,"
"he believed, was his imminent destiny. And while he lingered on the"
"bridge, fancy-perplexed between grief and joy, a small window opened in"
a quaint house that bent its bulging gables crookedly over the gleaming
"water, and a girl, holding a small lamp, looked out for a moment. Her"
"face, fresh and smiling, was fair to see against the background of"
"dense shadow,--the light she carried flashed like a star,--and leaning"
"down from the lattice she sang half-timidly, half mischievously, the"
"first two or three bars of the old song.. ""Du, du, liegst in mein"
"Herzen ... !"" ""Ah! Gute Nacht, Liebchen!"" said a man's voice below."
"""Gute Nacht! Schlafen sie wohl!"""
"A light laugh, and the window closed, ""Good-night! Sleep well!"" Love's"
"best wish!--and for some sad souls life's last hope,--a ""good-night and"
"sleep well!"" Poor tired World, for whose weary inhabitants oftentimes"
the greatest blessing is sleep! Good-night! sleep well! but the sleep
"implies waking.--waking to a morning of pleasure or sorrow,--or labor"
"that is only lightened by,--Love! Love!--love divine,--love"
"human,--and, sweetest love of all for us, as Christ has taught when"
both divine and human are mingled in one!
"Alwyn, glancing up at the clustering stars, hanging like pendent"
"fire-jewels above him, thought of this marvel-glory of Love,--this"
seem that the Emperor's power is in danger rather than Luther and his
"adherents. 'If I had been present', writes Erasmus, 'I should have"
endeavoured that this tragedy would have been so tempered by moderate
arguments that it could not afterwards break out again to the still
greater detriment of the world.'
The imperial sentence was pronounced: within the Empire (as in the
Burgundian Netherlands before that time) Luther's books were to be
"burned, his adherents arrested and their goods confiscated, and Luther"
was to be given up to the authorities. Erasmus hopes that now relief
will follow. 'The Luther tragedy is at an end with us here; would it had
"never appeared on the stage.' In these days Albrecht Dürer, on hearing"
"the false news of Luther's death, wrote in the diary of his journey that"
"passionate exclamation: 'O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where will you be?"
"Hear, you knight of Christ, ride forth beside the Lord Christ, protect"
"the truth, obtain the martyr's crown. For you are but an old manikin. I"
"have heard you say that you have allowed yourself two more years, in"
"which you are still fit to do some work; spend them well, in behalf of"
"the Gospel and the true Christian faith.... O Erasmus, be on this side,"
that God may be proud of you.'
"It expresses confidence in Erasmus's power, but at bottom is the"
expectation that he will not do all this. Dürer had rightly understood
Erasmus.
"The struggle abated nowise, least of all at Louvain. Latomus, the most"
"dignified and able of Louvain divines, had now become one of the most"
"serious opponents of Luther and, in so doing, touched Erasmus, too,"
"indirectly. To Nicholas of Egmond, the Carmelite, another of Erasmus's"
"compatriots had been added as a violent antagonist, Vincent Dirks of"
"Haarlem, a Dominican. Erasmus addresses himself to the faculty, to"
"defend himself against the new attacks, and to explain why he has never"
chill horror of the unknown. Something had happened--that they felt.
Lois crept to the doorway and peered out into the gathering daylight.
"Here and there, half hidden behind the shelter of the trees, she could"
"see the khaki-clad figures of the Gurkhas, some kneeling, some"
"standing, their rifles raised to their dark faces, waiting like"
"statues for the enemy that never came. A dead, petrified world, the"
"only living thing the sunshine, which played in peaceful indifference"
upon the scene of an old and a new tragedy! Lois thought of her
mother. By the power of an overwrought imagination she looked back
through a quarter of a century to a day of which this present was a
strange and horrible repetition. For a moment she lived her mother's
"life, lived through the hours of torturing doubt and fear, and when a"
stifled cry called her back to the reality and forced her to turn from
"the sunlight to the dark room, it was as though the dead had risen, as"
though her dreams had taken substance. She saw pale faces staring at
her; she saw on the rusty truckle-bed a figure which rose up and held
"out frantic, desperate arms toward her. But it was no dream--no"
"phantom. Mrs. Cary, wild-eyed and distraught, struggled to rise to her"
feet and come toward her.
"""Where is Beatrice?"" she cried hysterically. ""Where is Beatrice? I"
"dreamed she was dead!--It isn't true! Say it isn't true!"""
Lois hurried back. In the confusion of their retreat she had lost
"sight of Beatrice, and now a cold fear froze her blood. She called her"
"name, adding her voice to the half-delirious mother's appeal; but"
"there was no answer, and as she prepared to leave the shelter of the"
"bungalow to go in search of the lost girl, a pair of strong hands"
grasped her by the shoulders and forced her back.
"""Lois, stand back! They are coming!"""
"pocket. He knew that Captain Dove was merely trying to aggravate him,"
and it would not have been politic to stray from the matter in hand. He
lighted a cigarette at his leisure and waited for what should come next.
He had changed his mind as to taking the old man fully into his
confidence. He thought he could see his way to get all he wanted for a
very great deal less than that might have cost him.
"""Want a drink?"" Captain Dove demanded, no doubt with the idea that a"
"dose of spirit might serve to stir up his visitor's temper, and looked"
"surprised at Slyne's curt head-shake, still more surprised over his"
response.
"""I can't afford to drink at all hours of the day and night now,"" said"
"Slyne austerely. ""That sort of thing was all very well at sea, but--The"
business I have in hand isn't of the sort that can be carried out on raw
"brandy. And you'll have to taper off too, if you want to come in."""
"""Strike--me--sky-blue!"" exclaimed the old man, and Slyne held up a"
reproving hand.
"""I can do with a good deal less of your bad language into the bargain,"""
"he mentioned coldly, ""if you don't mind. In short, I want you to"
understand from the start that you've got to behave as if you were a
"reasonable human being and not a dangerous lunatic, or--I'll leave you"
"to rot, in the hole you've got yourself into."""
"Captain Dove, scarcely able to credit the evidence of his own ears but,"
"none the less, apparently, thinking hard, darted a very ugly glance at"
"him, and noticed the diamonds in his shirt-front. Under the strongest"
temptation to call in a couple of deck-hands and have him thrown off the
"ship, Captain Dove obviously paused to consider whether those could be"
"of any intrinsic value. He was, of course, satisfied that he knew"
"sullen. He looked frowningly at me, and I watched him equally"
"frowningly, and took him for a thinker, an Ibsenite whose imagination"
was lost among the ice of his own country. Now and then I would see
"him walking up and down the corridor, rubbing his hands together so"
continuously and so frantically that they made a noise like bones.
"“Suddenly, this gentleman is transformed as if by magic; he begins to"
"joke with the servants, he seizes a chair and dances with it, and the"
other day I saw him alone in the salon marching around with a paper hat
"on his head, like children playing soldiers, and blowing on a cornet,"
"also made of paper.” I stared at him in amazement, he smiled like a"
"child, and asked if he was disturbing me."
"“‘No, no, not in the least,’ I told him."
"“I have asked in the hotel if this man is crazy, and they have told me"
"that he is not, but is a professor, a man of science, who is known to"
have these strange fits of gaiety.
"“Another of the Norwegian’s doings has been to compose a serenade, with"
"a vulgar melody that would disgust you, and which he has dedicated ‘_A"
"la bella Italia_.’ He wrote the Italian words himself, but as he knows"
"no music, he had a pianist come here and write out his serenade. What"
he especially wants is that it should be full of sentiment; and so the
"pianist arranged it with directions and many pauses, which satisfied"
the Norwegian. Almost every night the serenade ‘_A la bella Italia_’
"is sung. Somebody who wants to amuse himself goes to the piano, the"
Norwegian strikes a languid attitude and chants his serenade. Sometimes
"he goes in front of the piano, sometimes behind, but invariably he hears"
"the storm of applause when it ends, and he bows with great gusto."
"“I don’t know whether it’s the other people who are laughing at him, or"
If you do not know Bogle’s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your
loss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you
should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions.
And if you belong to the half to whom waiters’ checks are things of
"moment, you should know Bogle’s, for there you get your money’s"
"worth—in quantity, at least."
"Bogle’s is situated in that highway of _bourgeoisie_, that boulevard of"
"Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables"
"in the room, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand,"
containing cruets of condiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you
"may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic"
dust. From the salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should
"extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet will his"
prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from Bogle’s cruets. Also
upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made “from
the recipe of a nobleman in India.”
"At the cashier’s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and"
"takes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change,"
"files your check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the"
weather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you
"would better not venture. You are not Bogle’s friend; you are a fed,"
"transient customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing"
of Gabriel’s dinner horn. So take your change and go—to the devil if
you like. There you have Bogle’s sentiments.
The needs of Bogle’s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a
"Voice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful,"
"lively, gracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There was"
no more necessity for another name at Bogle’s than there was for
hour even to approach the receiving counter--Vivie walked across to
the _Palace Hotel_ and asked the night porter to get her a room. But
"every room was occupied, they said--Americans, British, wealthy war"
"refugees from southern Belgium, military officers of the Allies. The"
only concession made to her--for the porter could hold out little
hope of any neighbouring hotel having an empty room--was to allow
her to sit and sleep in one of the comfortable basket chairs in the
long atrium. At six o'clock a compassionate waiter who knew the name
of Mrs. Warren gave her daughter some coffee and milk and a
_brioche_. At seven she managed to get her luggage taken to one of
the trams at the corner of the Boulevard du Jardin Botanique. The
train service to Tervueren was suspended--and at the Porte de Namur
she would be transferred to the No. 45 tram which would take her out
to Tervueren.
Even at an early hour Brussels seemed crowded and as the tram passed
along the handsome boulevards the shops were being opened and
tourists were on their way to Waterloo in brakes. Every one seemed
"to think in mid-August, 1914, that Germany was destined to receive"
her _coup-de-grâce_ on the field of Waterloo. It would be so
appropriate. And no one--at any rate of those who spoke their
thoughts aloud--seemed to consider that Brussels was menaced.
"Leaving her luggage at the tram terminus, Vivie sped on foot through"
"forest roads, where the dew still glistened, to the Villa"
"Beau-séjour. Mrs. Warren was not yet dressed, but was rapturous in"
"her greeting. Her chauffeur had been called up, so the auto could"
"not go out, but a farm cart would be sent for the luggage."
"""I believe, mother, I'm going to enjoy myself enormously,"" said"
"Vivie as she sat in the verandah in the morning sunshine, making a"
"delicious _petit déjeuner_ out of fresh rolls, the butter of the"
"A figure went to and fro by the water's brim, a figure pale in the"
"moonlight, as the form of the restless dead. The man kneeling in the"
bracken pressed his hands over his breast; his face seemed to start
"out of the gloom as the face of one who struggles in the sea,"
"submerged, yet desperate."
"Francesco saw the woman halt beside the mere. He saw her bend, take"
"water in her palms and dash it in her face. Standing in the moonlight,"
"she smoothed her hair between her fingers, her hands shining white as"
ivory against the dark bosom of her dress. She seemed to murmur to
"herself the while, words wistful and full of woe. Once she thrust her"
"hands to the sky and cried: ""Francesco! Francesco!"" The man kneeling"
in the shadows quivered like a wind-shaken reed.
The moon climbed higher and the woman by the mere spread her cloak
upon a patch of heather and laid herself thereon. Not a sound broke
"the silence; the woods were mute, the air lifeless as the steely"
water. An hour passed. The figure on the heather lay still as an
"effigy on a tomb. The man in the bracken cast one look at the stars,"
then crossed himself and crept out into the moonlight.
"Holding the scabbard of his sword, he skirted the mere with shimmering"
"armor, went down upon his knees and crawled slowly over the grass."
Hours seemed to elapse before the black patch of heather spread crisp
"and dry beneath his hands. Breathing through dilated nostrils, he"
trembled like one who creeps to stab a sleeping friend. The moonlight
"seemed to shower sparks upon him, as with supernatural glory. Tense"
anguish seemed to fill the night with sound.
Two more paces and he was close at the woman's side. The heather
"crackled beneath his knees. He held his breath, crept nearer, and"
knelt so near that he could have kissed Ilaria's face. Her head lay
a nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot
"that was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things"
"as eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked"
the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the
Institute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially
across the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and
"the ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room."
And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'
"Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr."
It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America
of juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America
of the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the
off-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War
and the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly
rocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the
"Institute. ""Knock on titanium,"" ""Whadya do for black-outs,"" ""Please,"
"lover, don't think when I'm around,"" America, as combat-shocked and"
crippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.
"Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,"
polarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's
"Foundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,"
or almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the
"phrase, ""... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,"" he took a"
"deep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and"
"his knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with"
"impartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning."
"Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory"
"chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep."
"These chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which"
"The Girl smiled at the emphasis on the last word, for she knew that it"
"referred to her. Furthermore, she had divined pretty well what had been"
"his thoughts concerning his old life; but, being essentially a woman of"
"action and not words, she said nothing."
A moment or so later he asked her to read to him. The Girl looked as she
might have looked if he had asked her to go to the moon.
"Notwithstanding, she got up and, presently, returned with a lot of old"
"school-books, which she solemnly handed over for his inspection."
The invalid smiled at the look of earnestness on the Girl's face.
"""Not these?"" he gently inquired. ""Where is the Dante you were telling me"
"about?"""
Once more the Girl went over to the book-shelf; when she came back she
"handed him a volume, which he glanced over carefully before showing her"
the place where he wished her to begin to read to him.
At first the Girl was embarrassed and stumbled badly. But on seeing that
he seemed not to notice it she gained courage and acquitted herself
"creditably, at least, so she flattered herself, for she could detect, as"
"she looked up from time to time, no expression other than pleasure on"
"his face. It may be surmised, though, that Johnson had not merely chosen"
"a page at random; on the contrary, when the book was in his hand he had"
"quickly found the lines which the Girl had, so to say, paraphrased, and"
"he was intensely curious to see how they would appeal to her. But now,"
"apparently, she saw nothing in the least amusing in them, nor in other"
"passages fully as sentimental. In fact, no comment of any kind was"
"forthcoming from her--though Johnson was looking for it and, to tell the"
"truth, was somewhat disappointed--when she read that Dante had probably"
never spoken more than twice to Beatrice and his passion had no other
the woman's son's soul is not in the animal. The woman is not entitled
to the deer because she cannot prove that it is. The deer will therefore
remain with the court until some properly authenticated claim is put
in.'
"So the two parties were turned out, the woman in bitter tears, and the"
"hunters angry and vexed, and the deer remained the property of the"
judge.
But this decision was against all Burmese ideas of justice. He should
"have given the deer to the woman. 'He wanted it for himself,' said a"
"Burman, speaking to me of the affair. 'He probably killed it and ate it."
Surely it is true that officials are of all the five evils the
"greatest.' Then my friend remembered that I was myself an official, and"
"he looked foolish, and began to make complimentary remarks about English"
"officials, that they would never give such an iniquitous decision. I"
turned it off by saying that no doubt the judge was now suffering in
"some other life for the evil wrought in the last, and the Burman said"
that probably he was now inhabiting a tiger.
"It is very easy to laugh at such beliefs; nothing is, indeed, easier"
than to be witty at the expense of any belief. It is also very easy to
"say that it is all self-deception, that the children merely imagine that"
"they remember their former lives, or are citing conversation of their"
elders.
"How this may be I do not know. What is the explanation of this, perhaps"
the only belief of which we have any knowledge which is at once a living
"belief to-day and was so as far back as we can get, I do not pretend to"
"say. For transmigration is no theory of Buddhism at all, but was a"
"leading tenet in the far older faith of Brahmanism, of which Buddhism"
"was but an offshoot, as was Christianity of Judaism."
tightened and I stopped breathing altogether. But the explosion that
"followed was fainter than the last. Then there was another, still"
further off. All my muscles gradually relaxed and a delicious feeling of
relief pervaded my whole being. The buzzing noise became more and more
"feeble. I got up and walked back to the marquee, trembling and weak at"
the knees. The others followed.
"Most of us went to bed, but a few continued to pace up and down in great"
agitation. One man picked up his blankets in a bundle and went off in
"order to sleep in the open fields, far away from the camp."
An hour had hardly passed before distant anti-aircraft fire broke out
"again. Anxiety began to renew its tortures. We heard the dull, sullen"
roar of bombs exploding at intervals. Then fourteen burst in rapid
succession as though a gigantic ball of solid iron had bounced fourteen
times with thundering reverberations on a resonant surface. But the
sound of firing died down and soon all was quiet. And then sleep came
upon us and our troubles were over for a time.
The next morning was windless and clear. All day we kept looking at the
"sky, but not a cloud was to be seen."
"The evening approached, darkness fell, and the stars shone. ""Lights Out"""
"was sounded and we extinguished our candles. None of us said a word, but"
everybody knew what everybody else was thinking of. And soon we heard
"the familiar buzz. At first it only came from one propeller, but others"
"arrived and the sound multiplied and increased in volume, and at the"
same time it rose and fell in irregular gusts and regular pulsations.
Anti-aircraft firing burst out suddenly and for a few minutes there was
"a blending of whining, whistling, rushing sounds overhead punctuated by"
"faint reports. The firing ceased, but the droning noises continued"
louder than ever. The German aeroplanes seemed to be above us like a
"Beatae Mariae Virginis_"" among the many relics to be seen in the"
"Church of SS. Cosmo and Damiano, near the Forum."
[Sidenote: No Women Admitted.]
It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness that women
"are never allowed to enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church"
"of S. Croce, except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th,"
"notwithstanding the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman, and that"
the church owes its existence to her and is also indebted to her for
"the piece of the true cross which it boasts, and which has given it its"
"name. So while men are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena,"
women are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer through the
railing. The same degrading discrimination is made in the Church of S.
"Prassede (who also was a woman) as to entering the splendid chapel,"
"Orto del Paradiso, which contains the column of blood jasper to which"
"Christ was bound, and which was ""given by the Saracens to Giovanni"
"Colonna, cardinal of this church, and legate of the Crusade, because"
"when he had fallen into their hands and was about to be put to death,"
"he was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial light."""
Females are never allowed to enter this chapel except upon Sundays in
"Lent, but are permitted to look at the relic through a grating.[12]"
[Sidenote: Four Other Stones of Great Interest.]
The mention of this column reminds me of the two columns in the Church
"of S. Maria Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber, near St."
"Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating that they were the pillars to"
"which St. Peter and St. Paul were fastened, respectively, when they"
suffered flagellation by order of Nero. A little farther on towards
"St. Peter's is the Piazza Scossa Cavalli, with a pretty fountain."
"""Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which tells how when S."
"lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the key with her!"" She finally"
"""deserted him on his death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils"
"of his ten years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build"
"the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria"
"Pamfili,"" west of the Janiculan Hill. This villa, with its casino,"
"garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded lawns and woods, and its fine view"
"of St. Peter's standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and"
"the blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one of the"
"loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of the latter-day"
Romans and visitors to their city on the two afternoons of the week on
which it is open to pedestrians and two-horse carriages.
"The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in which, as we have just"
"seen, Olympia became such an adept, gave rise to the biting Latin"
couplet--
"""An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;"
"Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."""
Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope for purposes
of gain are less objectionable than those of Olympia. Dr. Alexander
"Robertson, in his _Roman Catholic Church in Italy_, just published,"
"says: ""One of the very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a"
penny-in-the-slot blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately to be
"seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the Piazza Colonna and"
"the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is dropped into it. The cinematograph,"
"or wheel of life, goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession"
"of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the Pope in a"
"sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards. As he is carried past"
"the spectator, he turns towards the window of his chair, a smile"
"overspreads his face, he raises his hands, and gives his blessing. On"
these machines there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing
CHAPTER XVII
THE GERMANS IN BRUSSELS: 1915-1916
"In the early spring of 1915, Vivie, anxious not to see her mother in"
"utter penury, and despairing of any effective assistance from the"
Americans (very much prejudiced against her for the reasons already
"mentioned), took her mother's German and Belgian securities of a"
"face value amounting to about £18,000 and sold them at her Belgian"
"bank for a hundred thousand francs (£4,000) in Belgian or German"
"bank notes. She consulted no one, except her mother. Who was there"
to consult? She did not like to confide too much to Colonel von
"Giesselin, a little too prone in any case to ""protect"" them. But as"
"she argued with Mrs. Warren, what else were they to do in their"
"cruel situation? If the Allies were eventually victorious, Mrs."
Warren could return to England. There at least she had in safe
"investments £40,000, ample for the remainder of their lives. If"
"Germany lost the War, the German securities nominally worth two"
hundred thousand marks might become simply waste paper; even now
they were only computed by the bank at a purchase value of about one
fifth what they had stood at before the War. If Germany were
"victorious or agreed to a compromise peace, her mother's shares in"
Belgian companies might be unsaleable. Better to secure now a lump
sum of four thousand pounds in bank notes that would be legal
"currency, at any rate as long as the German occupation lasted. And"
"as one never knew what might happen, it was safer still to have all"
"this money (equivalent to a hundred thousand francs), in their own"
"keeping. They could live even in war time, on such a sum as this"
"for four, perhaps five years, as they would be very economical and"
Vivie would try to earn all she could by teaching. It was useless to
hope they would be able to return to Villa Beau-séjour so long as
"were reprinted by Froben. On his return journey, Erasmus, whose work had"
"been hampered all through the summer by indisposition, and who had, on"
"that account, been unable to finish it, fell seriously ill. He reached"
"Louvain with difficulty (21 September 1518). It might be the pestilence,"
"and Erasmus, ever much afraid of contagion himself, now took all"
precautions to safeguard his friends against it. He avoided his quarters
"in the College of the Lily, and found shelter with his most trusted"
"friend, Dirck Maertensz, the printer. But in spite of rumours of the"
"plague and his warnings, first Dorp and afterwards also Ath came, at"
"once, to visit him. Evidently the Louvain professors did not mean so"
"badly by him, after all."
[Illustration: XVIII. Title-page of the New Testament printed by Froben
in 1520]
But the differences between Erasmus and the Louvain faculty were deeply
"rooted. Lee, hurt by the little attention paid by Erasmus to his"
"objections, prepared a new critique, but kept it from Erasmus, for the"
"present, which irritated the latter and made him nervous. In the"
"meantime a new opponent arose. Directly after his return to Louvain,"
Erasmus had taken much trouble to promote the establishment of the
"_Collegium Trilingue_, projected and endowed by Jerome Busleiden, in his"
"testament, to be founded in the university. The three biblical"
"languages, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, were to be taught there. Now when"
"James Latomus, a member of the theological faculty and a man whom he"
"esteemed, in a dialogue about the study of those three languages and of"
"theology, doubted the utility of the former, Erasmus judged himself"
"concerned, and answered Latomus in an _Apologia_. About the same time"
(spring 1519) he got into trouble with the vice-chancellor himself.
Erasmus thought that Ath had publicly censured him with regard to his
"'Praise of Marriage', which had recently appeared. Though Ath withdrew"
"at once, Erasmus could not abstain from writing an _Apologia_, however"
"would be a further reduction. That was quite true. Bob knew, because he"
had had a vast deal of experience with the trust’s method of doing
"business. They would ruin him, no matter how great the cost, because he"
was dangerous to their continued well-being. With Bainbridge in the
"ring, and fighting vigorously against the graft and wholesale theft of"
"timberlands, those juicy melon cuttings which had been so pleasing to"
the stockholders would cease--therefore Bainbridge must go.
"Presently Bob’s eyes fell again to the letter, and somehow that single"
sentence seemed to stand out as if written in capitals: “It hurts like
"sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left to do but give in and make"
the best terms we can.”
"For a second Bob stared, the blood rushing into his face, a crimson"
"flood. Make terms with Crane? Go on his knees to that scoundrel, who had"
long ago parted with the last shred of decency and self-respect? Not
much!
"They must have resources enough to meet that note, at least. The trust"
could not keep the price of lumber down indefinitely. They must weather
"the storm in some way. And when this drive was safe at the mills, ready"
"to be cut into lumber, they would have the laugh on Elihu Crane."
"Oblivious to the men about him, even to the fact that the cook had some"
"time ago announced supper, Bainbridge began to search his mind for means"
of staving off the evil day. Most of the stocks and bonds constituting
his private fortune had been already pledged as collateral for loans to
the firm. He still had a few thousand dollars’ worth of Steel Preferred
"which could be sold; and there was Pinecrest, the beautiful and costly"
"home on the outskirts of Bangor, which had been left him by his father."
"It should not be difficult to raise a mortgage of ten thousand, at"
"least, on the place."
the Vakutans have never fished for kaloma in the Sanaroa Lagoon.
Now let us describe the technicalities and the ceremonial connected
with the fishing for kaloma. It will be better to give an account
"of how this is done in the Lagoon of Sinaketa, round the sandbank"
"of Nanoula, as this is the normal and typical form of kaloma"
"fishing. Moreover, when the Sinaketans do it in Sanaroa, the"
"proceedings are very much the same, with just one or two phases"
missed out.
The office of magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma) is hereditary in
"two sub-clans, belonging to the Malasi clan, and one of them is that"
"of the main chief of Kasi'etana. After the Monsoon season is over,"
"that is, some time in March or April, ogibukuvi (i.e., in the season"
of the new yams) the magician gives the order for preparations. The
"community give him a gift called sousula, one or two bringing a"
"vaygu'a, the rest supplying gugu'a (ordinary chattels), and some"
"food. Then they prepare the canoes, and get ready the binabina stones,"
with which the spondylus shell will be knocked off the reef.
"Next day, in the morning, the magician performs a rite called"
"'kaykwa'una la'i,' 'the attracting of the reef,' for, as in the"
"case of several other marine beings, the main seat of the kaloma is"
"far away. Its dwelling place is the reef Ketabu, somewhere between"
"Sanaroa and Dobu. In order to make it move and come towards Nanoula,"
it is necessary to recite the above-named spell. This is done by the
magician as he walks up and down on the Sinaketa beach and casts
"his words into the open, over the sea, towards the distant seat"
of the kaloma. The kaloma then 'stand up' (itolise) that is start
from their original coral outcrop (vatu) and come into the Lagoon of
"Sinaketa. This spell, I obtained from To'udavada, the present chief"
"of Kasi'etana, and descendant of the original giver of this shell,"
Somehow I suspected her of a deliberate intention to mislead me in this
"matter.  She was a shrewd woman, who only disclosed her secrets when it"
was to her own interests or the interests of her friends at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to do so.  In Paris there is a vast network of French
"intrigue, and it behoves the diplomatist always to be wary lest he"
should fall into the pitfalls so cunningly prepared for him.  The
dividing line between truth and untruth is always so very difficult to
define in modern diplomacy.  It is when the European situation seems
most secure that the match is sufficiently near to fire the mine.
"Fortunate it is that the public, quick to accept anything that appears"
"in the daily journals, can be placed in a sense of false security by"
articles inspired by one or other of the embassies interested.  If it
"were not so, European panics would certainly be of frequent occurrence."
"My Chief sauntered by, chatting with his close personal friend, Prince"
"Olsoufieff, the Russian Ambassador, who looked a truly striking figure"
"in his white uniform, with the Cross of St. Andrew glittering at his"
"throat.  The latter, as he passed, exclaimed confidentially in Russian"
"to my Chief, who understood that language, having been first Secretary"
of Embassy in Petersburg earlier in his career:
"""Da, ya po-ni-mai-u.  Ya sam napishu.""  (""Yes, I understand.  I will"
"write for you myself."")"
"Keen antagonists in diplomacy though they very often were, yet in"
private life a firm friendship existed between the pair--a friendship
dating from the days when the one had been British Attache in Petersburg
and the other had occupied a position in the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs--that large grey building facing the Winter Palace.
"""The lion and the bear strolling together,"" laughed the toothless old"
"Baronne, after they had passed.  ""Olsoufieff is a charming man, but he"
voices. It seemed to him that he recognised Nick's voice. But whoever it
"was, he spoke in whispers, and though the wounded man strove to hear, he"
was unsuccessful.
After a while he heard the door close and then the tension was somewhat
"relaxed, for he knew that she was keeping his presence in her cabin a"
secret with all the wiles of a clever and loving woman. And more and
more he determined to gain an honoured place for her in some
"community--an honoured place for himself and her. Vague, very vague, of"
"course, were the new purposes and plans that had so suddenly sprang up"
"because of her influence, but the desire to lead a clean life had"
"touched his heart, and since his old calling had never been pleasing to"
"him, he did not for a moment doubt his ability to succeed."
"The morning was half gone when the Girl returned to her patient. Then,"
"in tones that did her best to make her appear free from anxiety, she"
"told him that it was the barkeeper, as he had surmised, with whom she"
had been talking and that she had been obliged to take him into her
"confidence. The man made no comment, for the situation necessarily was"
"in her hands, and he felt that she could be relied upon not to make any"
"mistake. Four people, he was told, knew of his presence in the cabin. So"
"far as Rance was concerned she had absolute faith in his honour, gambler"
though he was; there was nothing that Nick would not do for her; and as
"for the Indians, the secret was sure to be kept by them, unless"
"Jackrabbit got hold of some whisky--a contingency not at all likely, for"
"Nick had promised to see to that. In fact, all could be trusted to be as"
silent as the grave.
"The invalid had listened intently; nevertheless, he sighed:"
"""It's hard to lie here. I don't want to be caught _now_."""
He assisted her to carry the inert old woman across the street and a
"short distance along the opposite pavement. Here, there was a"
"pleasant, modest-looking tea-shop with the name of Walcker over the"
"front, and embedded in the plate glass were the words ""Tea Rooms."""
"These of course dated from long before the war, when the best"
Chinese tea was only four francs the demi-kilo and the fashion for
afternoon tea had become established in Brussels. Vivie and her
mother had often entered Walcker's shop in happier days for a cup of
"tea and delicious forms of home-made pastry. Besides the cakes,"
"which in pre-war times were of an excellence rarely equalled, they"
had been drawn to the pleasant-looking serving woman. She was so
"English in appearance, though she only spoke French and Flemish."
Behind the shop was a cosy little room where the more intimate
clients were served with tea; a room with a look-out into a little
square of garden. Thither Mrs. Warren was carried or supported. She
"regained consciousness slightly as she was placed on a chair,"
"opened her eyes, and said ""Thank you, my dears."" Then her head fell"
over to one side and she was dead--seemingly....
The _agent de police_ went away to fetch a doctor and to disperse
the crowd of _ketjes_[1] and loafers which had transferred itself
"from the hotel to the tea-shop. The shop woman, who was one of those"
angels of kindness that turn up unexpectedly in the paths of unhappy
"people, called in a stout serving wench from the kitchen, and the"
three of them carried Mrs. Warren out of the inner tea-room into the
"back premises and a spare bedroom. Here she was laid on the bed,"
partially undressed and all available and likely restoratives
applied.

Germans and maddened them by mimicking their military manoeuvres!]
"whose names were unknown to Grey, but who evidently were characters well"
known to the others of the company.
"""There is no such thing as justice left, or purity of taste, or any such"
"thing!"" shouted a handsome, well-proportioned fellow, whose face had"
"attracted Grey’s notice several times, and seemed dimly familiar to him."
"""Look at the mouthing mountebanks that walk the boards now!  They strut"
"like peacocks, they gibber like apes.  They have neither voice, nor"
"figure, nor talent, nor grace.  But, forsooth, because some fine dame"
"has smiled upon them, or they are backed by a nobleman’s patronage, they"
"can crow it over the rest of us like a cock upon his dunghill, and we,"
"who have the talent and the gifts, may rot like rats in our holes!"""
"""Shame! shame! shame!"" cried an admiring chorus."
"""Look at me!"" thundered the young man, his eyes flashing.  ""Who dares"
"say I cannot act?  Have I not held spellbound, hanging on my lips, whole"
houses of beauty and fashion?  Have I lost my skill or cunning?  Has my
"voice or has my grace departed from me?  Wherefore, then, do I sit here"
"idle and hungry, whilst men not fit to black my boots hold the boards"
"and fill their pouches with gold?  Why such injustice, I say?"""
A chorus of indignation again arose; but out of the shadows came a deep
voice.
"""The answer is easy, friend Lionel; arrogance and drink have been the"
cause of your downfall.  How could any manager continue to engage you?
How many times has it happened that you have come to the theatre sodden
with drink?  How many representations have you spoiled by your bestial
"folly? They were patient with you.  Oh yes, they were very patient; for"
they knew your gifts and recognized them.  But you met friendly rebuke
or warning with haughtiness and scorn.  You would listen to no counsel;
"of all virtue. The type is well-known, and can be found at resorts and"
"boarding-houses, where it grows and flourishes."
"In spite of her wasted adolescence, her examination and her"
"""independence,"" she has been coming home from her office stool or her"
teacher's desk more or less exhausted; suddenly she finds herself in the
"midst of a sweet and unlimited idleness, with quantities of tinned food"
"for her meals. The company round her is continually changing, tourists"
"come and go, and she passes from hand to hand for walks and talks; the"
"tone is ""country informality."" This is sheer loose living; this is a life"
stripped of all purpose. She does not even sleep enough because she hears
"through the thin wall every sound made by her neighbor in the next room,"
while arriving or departing Englishmen bang doors all night. In a short
"time she has become a neurotic, sated with company, surfeited with herself"
and the place. She is ready to go off with the next halfway respectable
organ grinder that happens along. And so she pairs off with the most
"casual visitors, flirts with the guide, hovering about him and making"
"bandages for his fingers, and at last throws herself into the arms of a"
nameless nobody who has arrived at the house today.
This is the Torsen type.
"And now, at this very moment, she retires to her room to collect the"
"fragments of herself, in preparation for her departure--at the end of the"
"summer. It takes time; there are so many fragments, one in every corner."
But perhaps it consoles her to think that she knows the genitive of
_mensa_.
"Things are not quite so bad for the actor. He has staked nothing, is"
"committed to nothing. No part of his life is destroyed, nor anything"
"within him. As he came, so he goes, cheerful, empty, nice. In fact he is"
even something more of a man because he has really made a conquest. He has
"such-and-such solicitors, and to Lewis Maitland Praed A.R.A. in Hans"
Place.
She went to the Brussels bank a fortnight after her mother's death
whilst still availing herself of the hospitality of Madame
Trouessart: to withdraw the jewellery and plate which she had
deposited there on her mother's account. But there she found herself
"confronted with the red tape of the Latin which is more formidable,"
"even, than that of the land of Dora at the present day. These"
deposited articles were held on the order of Mrs. Warren; they could
not be given up till her will was proved and letters of
administration had been granted. So _that_ small resource in funds
"was withheld, at any rate till some time after peace had been"
declared. However she had a thousand pounds (in notes) between her
"and penury, and the friendship of Minna von Stachelberg. She would"
resume her evening lessons in English--Madame Trouessart had found
her several pupils--and she would lodge--as they kindly invited her
to do--with the Baptist pastor and his wife in the Rue Haute. And
"she would help Minna at the hospital, and hope to be rewarded with"
the opportunity of bringing comfort and consolation to the wounded
British prisoners.
"Thus, with no unbearable misery, she passed the year 1916. There"
"were short commons in the way of food, and the cold was sometimes"
cruel. But Madame Walcker was a wonderful cook and could make soup
"from a sausage skewer, and heaped _édredons_ on Vivie's bed. Vivie"
sighed a little over the Blue Placards which announced endless
German victories by land and sea; and she gasped over the dreadful
Red Placards with their lists of victims sentenced to death by the
military courts. She ground her teeth over the announcement of
"Gabrielle Petit's condemnation, and behind the shut door of Minna's"
small sitting-room--and she only shut the door not to compromise
An apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a
new Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have
sought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of
facts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable
materials that have recently been published by continental historians.
To explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an
"elaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space"
"absolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the"
most important topics.
"To deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief"
"importance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and"
"Vandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrück, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,"
and Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.
I have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or
"collections of documents due to the labours of the ""Société d'Histoire"
"Contemporaine,"" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,"
"Caudrillier, Capitaine ""J.G.,"" Lévy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,"
"and others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,"
"Klinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the"
recently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not
"devoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with"
caution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Léon Lecestre and
M. Léonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life
of the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely
revise our judgments on many of its episodes.
"But I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not"
been able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During
"a study of this period for an earlier work published in the ""Cambridge"
"Historical Series,"" I ascertained the great value of the British"
records for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our

"Erasmus never felt happy, was never content. This may perhaps surprise"
"us for a moment, when we think of his cheerful, never-failing energy, of"
his gay jests and his humour. But upon reflection this unhappy feeling
tallies very well with his character. It also proceeds from his general
attitude of warding off. Even when in high spirits he considers himself
"in all respects an unhappy man. 'The most miserable of all men, the"
"thrice-wretched Erasmus,' he calls himself in fine Greek terms. His life"
"'is an Iliad of calamities, a chain of misfortunes. How can anyone envy"
_me_?' To no one has Fortune been so constantly hostile as to him. She
"has sworn his destruction, thus he sang in his youth in a poetical"
complaint addressed to Gaguin: from earliest infancy the same sad and
hard fate has been constantly pursuing him. Pandora's whole box seems to
have been poured out over him.
This unhappy feeling takes the special form of his having been charged
"by unlucky stars with Herculean labour, without profit or pleasure to"
himself:[16] troubles and vexations without end. His life might have
been so much easier if he had taken his chances. He should never have
left Italy; or he ought to have stayed in England. 'But an immoderate
love of liberty caused me to wrestle long with faithless friends and
inveterate poverty.' Elsewhere he says more resignedly: 'But we are
driven by fate'.
That immoderate love of liberty had indeed been as fate to him. He had
always been the great seeker of quiet and liberty who found liberty late
"and quiet never. By no means ever to bind himself, to incur no"
obligations which might become fetters--again that fear of the
entanglements of life. Thus he remained the great restless one. He was
"never truly satisfied with anything, least of all with what he produced"
"himself. 'Why, then, do you overwhelm us with so many books', someone at"
"would simply ask those who agitate and cry the Yellow Peril, the means"
"they would suggest for the adopting of their propaganda, if their words"
are not to be empty ones.
"Suppose any country wanted to subjugate Japan, and should want to send"
"an army to fight on the soil of Japan, what number of men do they think"
"would suffice? No general in the whole world would, I am sure, be bold"
enough to undertake the task with under one million men. I have reason
"to believe even that number would not suffice, but for a moment let it"
be that number. What country in the world can send that number over the
"broad ocean? Germany, France, England, or America? Russia seems to have"
"the greatest chance, being nearer to Japan. But her experience is"
already known.
"Suppose the idea of a land campaign be abandoned, and only a fleet be"
"sent to intimidate Japan by sea battles, or by harassing her commerce."
There would certainly be a better chance for any of the Occidental
"fleets than for the armies, in coping with the forces of Japan. Above"
"all, I frankly admit that England would be the most formidable foe in"
"that respect. But excepting England, is there any other country that can"
say with certainty that it can easily crush the Japanese navy? Is it
Germany? is it France? or is it--America?
"But supposing our navy were crushed; what next? It would, of course, be"
"a very ugly thing for us, but it would not mean the subjection of Japan."
"Our sea-coast towns may be bombarded, our commerce may be harassed, but"
"Japan will still subsist within her soil, for she can live without"
"depending on any other country for food. And, besides, disturbance of"
commerce would not be a loss only to her.
"Moreover, any country which should embark on such an enterprise would"
"have need to think it over twice (or, indeed, three or four times)"
of Montaigne. In Erasmus's writings that ideal wish ever recurs in the
"shape of a friendly walk, followed by a meal in a garden-house. It is"
"found as an opening scene of the _Antibarbari_, in the numerous"
"descriptions of meals with Colet, and the numerous _Convivia_ of the"
_Colloquies_. Especially in the _Convivium religiosum_ Erasmus has
"elaborately pictured his dream, and it would be worth while to compare"
"it, on the one hand with Thélème, and on the other with the fantastic"
design of a pleasure garden which Bernard Palissy describes. The little
Dutch eighteenth-century country-seats and garden-houses in which the
national spirit took great delight are the fulfilment of a purely
Erasmian ideal. The host of the _Convivium religiosum_ says: 'To me a
"simple country-house, a nest, is pleasanter than any palace, and, if he"
"be king who lives in freedom and according to his wishes, surely I am"
king here'.
Life's true joy is in virtue and piety. If they are Epicureans who live
"pleasantly, then none are more truly Epicureans than they who live in"
holiness and piety.
The ideal joy of life is also perfectly idyllic in so far that it
requires an aloofness from earthly concerns and contempt for all that is
sordid. It is foolish to be interested in all that happens in the world;
"to pride oneself on one's knowledge of the market, of the King of"
"England's plans, the news from Rome, conditions in Denmark. The sensible"
"old man of the _Colloquium Senile_ has an easy post of honour, a safe"
"mediocrity, he judges no one and nothing and smiles upon all the world."
"Quiet for oneself, surrounded by books--that is of all things most"
desirable.
On the outskirts of this ideal of serenity and harmony numerous flowers
"of aesthetic value blow, such as Erasmus's sense of decorum, his great"
"need of kindly courtesy, his pleasure in gentle and obliging treatment,"
Eppendorf employs spies everywhere who watch Erasmus's correspondence
"with his friends. Aleander continually sets people to combat him, and"
lies in wait for him wherever he can. His interpretation of the
intentions of his assailants has the ingenious self-centred element
which passes the borderline of sanity. He sees the whole world full of
calumny and ambuscades threatening his peace: nearly all those who once
were his best friends have become his bitterest enemies; they wag their
"venomous tongues at banquets, in conversation, in the confessional, in"
"sermons, in lectures, at court, in vehicles and ships. The minor"
"enemies, like troublesome vermin, drive him to weariness of life, or to"
death by insomnia. He compares his tortures to the martyrdom of Saint
"Sebastian, pierced by arrows. But his is worse, for there is no end to"
it. For years he has daily been dying a thousand deaths and that alone;
"for his friends, if such there are, are deterred by envy."
He mercilessly pillories his patrons in a row for their stinginess. Now
and again there suddenly comes to light an undercurrent of aversion and
hatred which we did not suspect. Where had more good things fallen to
his lot than in England? Which country had he always praised more? But
suddenly a bitter and unfounded reproach escapes him. England is
"responsible for his having become faithless to his monastic vows, 'for"
"no other reason do I hate Britain more than for this, though it has"
always been pestilent to me'.
He seldom allows himself to go so far. His expressions of hatred or
"spite are, as a rule, restricted to the feline. They are aimed at"
"friends and enemies, Budaeus, Lypsius, as well as Hutten and Beda."
Occasionally we are struck by the expression of coarse pleasure at
"another's misfortune. But in all this, as regards malice, we should not"
measure Erasmus by our ideas of delicacy and gentleness. Compared with
most of his contemporaries he remains moderate and refined.
"ingenuity to keep them alive during the journey. Four plants, two"
"Mimosas and two Telegraph plants, were taken in a portable box with"
"glass cover, and never let out of sight. In the Mediterranean they"
encountered bitter cold for the first time and nearly succumbed. They
"were unhappier still in the Bay of Biscay, and when they reached London"
there was a sharp frost. They had to be kept in a drawing room lighted
"by gas, the deadly influence of which was discovered the next morning"
when all the plants were found to be apparently killed. Two had been
"killed, and the other two were brought round after much difficulty. The"
plants were at once transferred to the hot-house in Regents Park. For
"every demonstration in Dr. Bose's private Laboratory at Maida Vale, the"
plant had to be brought and returned in a taxicab with closed doors so
"that no sudden chill might kill them. When travelling, the large box in"
"which they were, could not be trusted out of sight in the luggage van."
They had practically to be carried in a reserved compartment. The
"unusual care taken of the box always roused the greatest curiosity, and"
in an incredibly short time large crowds would gather. When travelling
"long distances, for example from London to Vienna, the carriage"
accommodation had to be secured in advance. It was this that saved Dr.
"Bose from being interned in Germany, where he was to commence his"
lectures on the 4th August. He was to start for the University of Bonn
"on the 2nd, but on account of hasty mobilisation of troops in Germany he"
could not secure the reserved accommodation. Two days after came the
proclamation of War!
OUTCOME OF HIS WORK
The success of his scientific mission exceeded his most sanguine
expectations. The work in which he long persevered in isolation and
"under most depressing difficulties, bore fruit at last. Apart from the"
full recognition that the progress of the world's science would be
"preserve you from evil. Amen.'""[13]"
[Sidenote: The Benefits of Buying a Fac-simile of the Chains.]
In the sacristy we found a young priest doing a thriving business in
"copies of the relic. We bought from him ""an iron _fac-simile_ of the"
"chains (about the size of an ordinary watch-chain), authenticated by a"
certificate testifying to its having touched the original chains. On
the back of this certificate was printed an extract from the Rules of
"the Confraternity of the chains of St. Peter, from which we learned"
that all associates in this brotherhood must wear such a _fac-simile_
"as we had just bought, that the objects of the Confraternity are ""The"
"propagation of the veneration of the chains of St. Peter, an increase"
"of devotion to the Holy See, prayers for the Pope's intention, for the"
"needs of Holy Church, the conversion of infidels and sinners, and the"
"extirpation of heresy and blasphemy,"" and that Pius IX. had granted to"
"the members of the Confraternity various indulgences, one of which is"
"""_A plenary indulgence and remission of all sins_[14] if one visits the"
"Church of San Pietro in Vincoli on January 18th[15] and June 29th,[16]"
"between the first vespers of the feast and sunset of the said days,"
"or on August 1st, or any one of the seven days following it. The usual"
"prayers for the Holy Father's intention,"" etc., are comprised in these"
"visits. We are told also that ""the foregoing indulgences are applicable"
"to the souls in purgatory."""
[Sidenote: The Relics in St. Peter's Cathedral.]
We may close this running account of the relics at Rome with a brief
"mention of those that are to be seen in St. Peter's itself, the largest"
and costliest church in the world. The construction of it extended
over one hundred and seventy-six years. The cost of the main building
alone was fifty million dollars. The annual outlay for repairs is
given to wickedness.
Down in the shady angle of the little orchard the old gipsy found a
"little garden of flowers, geranium and white jasmine, perhaps planted to"
"cast into the rude coffin of a neighbour, _Yerba Luisa_, or lemon"
"verbena for the decoctions of a simple pharmacopoeia, on the outskirts"
of these a yet smaller plot had been set aside. It was edged with white
"stones from the hillside, and many coloured bits of broken crockery"
decorated it. A rose-bush in the midst had been broken down by some
"hasty human foot, or perhaps by a bullock or other large trespassing"
animal. There were nigh a score of rose-buds upon it--all now parched
"and dead, and the whole had taken on the colour of the soil."
La Giralda stood a moment before laying her burden down. She had the
strong heart of her ancient people. The weakness of tears had not
"visited her eyes for years--indeed, not since she was a girl, and had"
"cried at parting from her first sweetheart, whom she never saw again. So"
she looked apparently unmoved at the pitiful little square of cracked
"earth, edged with its fragments of brown and blue pottery, and at the"
"broken rose-bush lying as if also plague-stricken across it, dusty,"
"desolate, and utterly forlorn. Yet, as we have said, was her heart by no"
"means impervious to feeling. She had wonderful impulses, this parched"
mahogany-visaged Giralda.
"""It is the little one's own garden--I will lay her here!"" she said to"
herself.
So without another word she departed in search of mattock and spade. She
"found them easily and shortly, for the hireling servants of the house"
"had fled in haste, taking nothing with them. In a quarter of an hour the"
"hole was dug. The rose-tree, being in the way, was dragged out and"
"thrown to one side. La Giralda, who began to think of her donkey and"
It was rather comical to see it. We were always climbing. And the line
"curved in great loops. So that as one looked out of the window, time and"
"again one started, seeing a little train running in front of us, in a"
"diverging direction, making big puffs of steam. But lo, it was our own"
little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead. We were quite a long
"train, but all trucks in front, only our two passenger coaches hitched"
on behind. And for this reason our own engine was always running fussily
"into sight, like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us,"
while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks.
I was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep
"slopes, how bravely it emerged on the sky-line. It is a queer railway. I"
would like to know who made it. It pelts up hill and down dale and round
"sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion, not as proper big railways"
"do, grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through"
"tunnels, but running up the hill like a panting, small dog, and having a"
"look round, and starting off in another direction, whisking us behind"
unconcernedly. This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.
They told me that Sardinia mines her own coal: and quite enough for her
"own needs: but very soft, not fit for steam-purposes. I saw heaps of it:"
"small, dull, dirty-looking stuff. Truck-loads of it too. And"
truck-loads of grain.
"At every station we were left ignominiously planted, while the little"
engines--they had gay gold names on their black little bodies--strolled
"about along the side-lines, and snuffed at the various trucks. There we"
"sat, at every station, while some truck was discarded and some other"
"sorted out like a branded sheep, from the sidings and hitched on to us."
"It took a long time, this did."
reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.
"Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the"
"strong, sweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of"
wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost
"seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: “What, dear?” as if"
"he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung"
"to him and wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his"
senses for the time confused and commingled. How could one be
"peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But,"
"was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?"
"“She has been in this room,” he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a"
"token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had"
belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of
"mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own—whence came"
it?
The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the
"flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins—those discreet,"
"indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of"
"mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their"
triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he
"came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his"
face. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the
"floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a"
"pawnbroker’s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of"
"dreams. In the last was a woman’s black satin hair bow, which halted"
"him, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is"
"femininity’s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales."
"And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the"
Of children such as this you may find any number. Only you have to look
"for them, as they are not brought forward spontaneously. The Burmese,"
"like other people, hate to have their beliefs and ideas ridiculed, and"
from experience they have learned that the object of a foreigner in
inquiring into their ways is usually to be able to show by his contempt
how very much cleverer a man he is than they are. Therefore they are
very shy. But once they understand that you only desire to learn and to
"see, and that you will always treat them with courtesy and"
"consideration, they will tell you all that they think."
"A fellow officer of mine has a Burmese police orderly, a young man about"
"twenty, who has been with him since he came to the district two years"
ago. Yet my friend only discovered accidentally the other day that his
orderly remembers his former life. He is very unwilling to talk about
"it. He was a woman apparently in that former life, and lived about"
"twenty miles away. He must have lived a good life, for it is a step of"
promotion to be a man in this life; but he will not talk of it. He
"forgets most of it, he says, though he remembered it when he was a"
child.
Sometimes this belief leads to lawsuits of a peculiarly difficult
"nature. In 1883, two years before the annexation of Upper Burma, there"
"was a case that came into the local Court of the oil district, which"
depended upon this theory of transmigration.
Opposite Yenangyaung there are many large islands in the river. These
"islands during the low water months are joined to the mainland, and are"
covered with a dense high grass in which many deer live.
"When the river rises, it rises rapidly, communication with the mainland"
"is cut off, and the islands are for a time, in the higher rises,"
entirely submerged. During the progress of the first rise some hunters
"A complete bibliography, cataloguing the whole of Croce's multifarious"
"activity, is outside the scope of this note. The nearest approach to it"
"can be found in G. Castellano's _Introduzione alle opere di B. Croce_,"
"Bari, 1920, which contains, besides, a full list of translations in"
"eight languages, a bibliography of the Italian and foreign critical"
"literature on Croce, and a very useful series of abstracts of"
discussions and judgments on Croce's work.
Besides articles and essays in American and English magazines and
"reviews, the following works of Croce have been translated into"
"English: the four volumes of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, the essay"
"on Hegel, the _Essence of Ãsthetics_, and the essays on _Ariosto,"
"Shakespeare, and Corneille_, by Douglas Ainslie; the essay on Vico, by"
"R. G. Collingwood, and the essays on Historical Materialism, by C. M."
Meredith. But the English or American student of Croce ought to rely
as little as possible on translations; the reading of the Italian text
"will be found comparatively easy, on the basis of a good acquaintance"
with Latin or with French. The labour entailed by the surmounting
of the first difficulties will be largely repaid by the advantages
"gained in coming into direct contact with Croce's thought, and by the"
acquisition of at least a reading knowledge of Italian.
"For the vast critical literature on Croce, scattered through the"
literary and philosophical reviews of Europe and of America during
"the last twenty years, we are compelled again to refer the reader to"
Castellano's book. We shall only mark out Croce's own autobiographical
"notes, the Contributo listed above, which, however, having been printed"
"for private circulation only, is not generally accessible except in"
the French translation printed in the _Revue de MÃ©taphysique et de
"Morale_, XXVI, pp. 1-40. The following are the only books which give"
"a general view of Croce's thought: G. Prezzolini, _Benedetto Croce_,"
"Naples, 1909; E. Chiocchetti, _La filosofia di B. Croce_, Florence,"
"immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in"
"appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly"
"bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening."
Chandler’s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office
of an architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered
architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he
would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building
was inferior in design to the great cathedral in Milan.
Out of each week’s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each
"ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one"
gentleman’s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.
He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he
"took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and"
"there dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a"
"few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a"
"well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label,"
"commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras."
This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to
Chandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one
début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened;
"but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as"
new as the first had been. To sit among _bon vivants_ under palms in
"the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the _habitués_ of such a"
paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl’s first dance and
short-sleeved tulle compared with this?
Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this
evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine
evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious _table
as obediently as well-trained dogs. Most of them were of the usual
"dark-red colour, a trifle soiled with the grey dust on which they had"
"been lying. A few were white, and these were the favourites of the"
"little Queen, who, though compelled to go on ahead, looked constantly"
back over her shoulder and endeavoured to imitate the shrill whistling
call by which La Giralda kept her flock in place.
When they arrived at the palace front the doors stood wide open. At Doña
"Susana's call an ancient major-domo appeared, his well-developed"
waistcoat mating ill with the pair of shrunk and spindle shanks which
"appeared beneath. The sentry boxes, striped red and gold with the"
"colours of Spain, were empty. At the guard-houses there were no lounging"
sergeants or smart privates eager to rise and salute as the little Queen
passed by.
There was already indeed about the palace an air of desolation. The
"great gates in front towards the town had been closed, as if to shut off"
"infection, and the Court itself, dwindled to a few faithful old"
"retainers of Fernando VII., surrounded his widow and her new husband"
with a devotion which was yet far more than their due.
It was not long before La Giralda had milked the remainder of the flock
and sent the creaming white pitchers into the palace. Little Isabel
danced with delight as one she-goat after another escaped with infinite
tail-waggling and bleatings of pleasure. And in the dearth of other
amusement she desired and even commanded the old woman to remain and
pasture her herd within the precincts of the palace. But La Giralda had
much yet to do. She must find out the state and dispositions of the town
"of San Ildefonso, and then rejoin her companions in the little corrie or"
cauldron-like _cirque_ in which she and the sergeant had left Rollo and
the other members of the expedition.
"circumstances mere nonsense--which it very likely was--and said so,"
"which betrayed inexperience, and Alicia Derosne asked what time it took"
place.
"""Eleven sharp,"" said the Governor, and returned to the account of the"
murder.
Time after time in the last few days Alicia had told herself that she
"could bear it no longer. At one moment she believed nothing, the next,"
nothing was too terrible for her to believe; now she would fly to
"Australia, or home, or anywhere out of New Lindsey; now a"
straightforward challenge to Medland alone would serve her turn.
Sometimes she felt as if she could put the whole thing on one side; five
minutes later found her pinning her whole life on the issue of it. Under
"her guarded face and calm demeanour, the storm of divided and"
"conflicting instincts and passions raged, and long solitary rambles"
became a necessary outlet for what she dared show to none. She shrank
"from seeing Medland, and yet longed to speak with him; she felt that to"
"mention the topic to him was impossible, and yet, if they met,"
"inevitable; that she would not have strength to face him, and yet could"
not let him go without clearing up the mystery. She told herself at one
"moment that she hardly knew him, at the next that between them nothing"
could be too secret for utterance.
What she hoped and feared befell her that morning. She went out for a
"walk in the Park, and before long she met the Premier, with his daughter"
and Norburn. The two last were laughing and talking--their quarrel was
"quite forgotten now--and Medland himself, she thought, looked as though"
his load of care were a little less heavy. The two men explained that
"they were on their way--a roundabout way, they confessed--to the"
"Council, and had seized the chance of some fresh air, while Daisy was"
"full of stories about yesterday's triumph, that left room only for a"
Franciscan monks were awakened by the most furious ringing of bells
"and by thundering knocks at the west door of the church, and hastening"
"thither, could see nothing but a wee naked pink foot peeping in from"
"under the door; but when they opened the door, without stood the little"
"naked figure of the true Bambino of Ara Coeli, shivering in the wind"
"and rain--so the false baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real"
"baby restored to its home, never to be trusted away alone any more."""
[Sidenote: The Communion Table Used by Christ.]
But if I dwell on all these interesting relics and images as I have
"done on the Holy Cradle and the miraculous Bambino, I shall never"
finish even the brief list of them which I had in mind when I began. I
"must hasten on, contenting myself with a bare mention of a few of the"
more notable relics at the other churches.
On the 8th of January we paid our first visit to the great Church of
"St. John Lateran,[9] and here also the relics interested us more than"
anything else. Under the canopy in the centre the skulls of St. Peter
and St. Paul are preserved. Beneath the altar we saw the wooden table
"on which the Apostle Peter is said to have ""celebrated mass"" in the"
"house of Pudens. The interest of this relic, however, is completely"
eclipsed by that of another relic over an altar at a little distance
"in the same church, viz: the cedar table used by our Lord and his"
disciples in the Last Supper. This table is concealed behind a bronze
relief representing that solemn scene in the Upper Room at Jerusalem.
[Sidenote: Other Relics at St. John Lateran.]
"""The Basilica claims to possess many valuable relics. Amongst these are"
"some portions of the manger in which Christ was cradled, the shirt and"
seamless coat made for him by the Virgin; some of the barley loaves
"is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat."
But there is a gulf between oneself and them. They have no inkling of
"our crucifixion, our universal consciousness. Each of them is pivoted"
"and limited to himself, as the wild animals are. They look out, and they"
"see other objects, objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously"
"at. But ""thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" has never entered"
"their souls at all, not even the thin end of it. They might love their"
"neighbour, with a hot, dark, unquestioning love. But the love would"
probably leave off abruptly. The fascination of what is beyond them has
not seized on them. Their neighbour is a mere external. Their life is
"centripetal, pivoted inside itself, and does not run out towards others"
"and mankind. One feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life,"
which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside.
"And so they lie about on the seats, play a game, shout, and sleep,"
and settle their long stocking-caps: and spit. It is wonderful in
them that at this time of day they still wear the long stocking-caps
as part of their inevitable selves. It is a sign of obstinate and
powerful tenacity. They are not going to be broken in upon by
world-consciousness. They are not going into the world's common clothes.
"Coarse, vigorous, determined, they will stick to their own coarse dark"
stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened
"hell. Their hell is their own hell, they prefer it unenlightened."
And one cannot help wondering whether Sardinia will resist right
through. Will the last waves of enlightenment and world-unity break over
them and wash away the stocking-caps? Or is the tide of enlightenment
and world-unity already receding fast enough?
"Certainly a reaction is setting in, away from the old universality,"
"back, away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism. Russia, with her"
"there is a transposition of ""second"" and ""third"" groups, which the"
"context corrects.) Motley, an inveterate Celtophobe, is at pains to make"
"out that the Walloons rebelled first and were first reconciled to Rome,"
"""exactly like their Celtic ancestors, fifteen centuries earlier."" He"
omits to comment on the fact that it was only the French form of
"Protestantism, that of Calvin, that became viable in the Netherlands at"
"all, or on the fact that indecent Anabaptism flourished mainly in"
Friesland; though he admits that the Lutheran movement left all
"religious rights in the hands of the princes, the people having to"
"follow the creed of their rulers. The ""racial"" explanation is mere"
"obscurantism, here as always. The Walloons of South Flanders were first"
affected simply because they were first in touch with Huguenotism. That
they were never converted in large numbers to Protestantism is later
"admitted by Motley himself (p. 797), who thereupon speaks of the"
"""intense attachment to the Roman ceremonial which distinguished the"
"Walloon population."" Thus his earlier statement that they had rebelled"
"against ""papal Rome"" is admittedly false. They had rebelled simply"
against the Spanish tyranny. Yet the false statement is left
standing--one more illustration of the havoc that may be worked in a
"historian's intelligence by a prejudice. (For other instances see, in"
"the author's volume _The Saxon and the Celt_, the chapters dealing with"
Mommsen and Burton.)
It was the Teutonic-speaking city populations of North Flanders and
Brabant who became Protestants in mass after the troubles had begun
"(Motley, p. 798). When the Walloon provinces withdrew from the"
"combination against Spain, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and"
Ypres joined the Dutch Union of Utrecht. They were one and all reduced
"by the skill and power of Alexander of Parma, who thereupon abolished"
the freedom of Protestant worship. The Protestants fled in thousands to
"England and the Dutch provinces, the remaining population, albeit mostly"
"Teutonic, becoming Catholic. At this moment one-and-a-half of the"
captain--the fellow who had apparently followed Tommy and Monsieur. He
"was a well-built blond, with a bullet-shaped head, high cheek bones and"
"deep set eyes--pig eyes. His right cheek bore several scars which,"
"considering his type, strongly suggested a German of University dueling"
"experiences. So I looked on him with a livelier suspicion, even as she"
seemed to be doing.
In an undertone he now said something that brought the old man to his
"feet. With fear written on their faces they talked for several minutes,"
during which the blond jerked his head once or twice toward the gambling
rooms. The girl had leaned forward watching them intently. Then with a
peremptory order the old one sent him away and sank back into his chair;
"but a moment later, clutching the tablecloth, he spoke a few words that"
made her recoil in evident horror.
"I did not know what to do or what to think, so I merely watched with"
"every sense alert. I saw him call the waiter for his settlement, I saw"
him take out a large roll of money and with trembling fingers peel off
the outside bill--a new and crinkly fifty-dollar note. I saw the girl
"idly marking on the winecard with a small gold pencil, though her eyes"
were veiling an intense excitement; and when the waiter returned with a
"pile of change which the old man began to count, I saw her furtively"
slip the winecard to her lap. A moment later it fell to the floor as she
arose to leave.
"Together they started toward the exit, but having taken a few steps she"
"left him with a brief word and returned, presumably for her glove."
"Partially free from his eternal vigilance, she raised her eyes without"
"dissimulation and looked quickly, appealingly into mine; then down at"
"her hand, on which she leaned, whose fingers were unfolding from a"
little ball of paper. Again into my eyes she looked--a look of infinite
appeal.
"dined quite cheerfully on dry bread and water, if any one would have"
listened to his stories of the wonders of his past life or the yet more
wonderful achievements of his future. He would have sat and spun yarns
"concerning the notches on Killiecrankie at a dyke-back, though he had"
"not tasted food for twenty-four hours, with the utmost composure and"
"relish. But his companions were of another kidney, being all valiant"
"trencher-men--John Mortimer desiring chiefly quantity in his eating,"
"while Etienne, no mean cook himself, desiderated rather variety and"
delicacy in the dishes which were set before him.
"At all events the dinner was a great success, though the Sergeant, who"
"evinced the greatest partiality for Rollo, often reproached him with"
"eating little, or inquired anxiously if the sauce of a certain dish"
"were not to his taste. Rollo, in the height of his argument, would"
"hastily affirm that it was delicious, and be off again in chase of some"
"deed of arms or daring, leaving the Sergeant's _chef-d'oeuvre_"
untasted on his plate.
At this the Sergeant shook his head in private to El Sarria.
"""It will stand in his way, I fear me,"" he said sententiously; ""was there"
ever a notable general yet who had not a fine belly to wag before him
upon horseback? 'Tis as necessary as the cock's feathers in his hat. Now
there is your cut-and-thrust officer who is good for nothing but to be
first in charges and to lead forlorn hopes--this colonel of yours is
just the figure for him. I have seen many a dozen of them get the lead
between their ribs and never regretted it before. But it is a devil's
pity that this young cockerel is not fonder of his dinner. How regardeth
"he the women?"""
"This last question was asked anxiously, yet with some hope. But this"
also El Sarria promptly scattered to the winds.
"ledge, while his body caught in the bushes, hung a moment, then dashed"
after its comrades below.
"Just then the end of a rope fell dangling by their side, let down from"
"the ramparts above. The duke tried to grasp it, but it shifted beyond"
"the gap. Down the rope came a man, then another; they both gained a"
"foothold on the narrow ledge. No sooner were their feet on it, than"
the duke sent them headlong to the bottom. Then grasping the rope
"without waiting to see if a third or fourth were coming down, he"
"shouted to Francesco to follow. Perilous as was the task, it was no"
"more so than to follow the steep and narrow goat's trail, and in a"
brief space of time they swung into a courtyard which was deserted.
"Anticipating no attack on this side, the defenders of Astura had"
"turned their whole attention to the southern slope, where the Pisans"
were scaling the walls. The roar of the conflict seemed to grow with
"the roar of the hurricane, and, as one by one the duke's men leaped"
"into the dark square, and the muster was complete, Count Rupert turned"
to Francesco.
"""I feared lest they might clean out the nest before our arrival,"" he"
"said, then, pointing to a distant glare of torches, he gave the word."
They caught the unwary defenders in the rear. No quarter was to be
given; the robber brood of Astura was to be exterminated.
"""Conradino!"" was the password, and above the taunts and cries of"
"Frangipani's hirelings it filled the night with its clamor, rode on"
"the wings of the storm, like the war-cry of a thousand demons."
Notwithstanding the fact that a few of the most daring among the Pisan
"admiral's men had scaled the ramparts and, leaping into the"
"Frangipani's stronghold, had tried to pave a way for those lagging"
"behind, their companions-in-arms were in dire straits. For those of"
will not fight for their lives. There is nothing of the sporting
proposition in pursuing them that is to be found in hunting the tiger or
"the grizzly. They are practically harmless, and in the Bayano region"
"wholly so, as there are no domestic animals upon which they can prey. It"
"is true their teeth and skins have a certain value in the market, but it"
is not for these the tourist kills them. Most of those slain for “sport”
sink instantly and cannot be recovered.

However if you visit Crocodile Creek with a typical party you will be
given a very fair imitation of a lively skirmish in actual war. From
"every part of the deck, from the roof of the cabin, and from the pilot"
house shots ring out from repeating rifles in a fierce desire to kill.
The Emersonian doctrine of compensation is often given illustration by
the killing of one of the hunters in the eagerness to get at the quarry.
In fact that is one of the commonest accidents of the tourist season in
Panama.
[Illustration: MAHOGANY TREES WITH ORCHIDS]
"Crocodile Creek is a deep, sluggish black stream, almost arched over by"
the boughs of the thick forest along the shores. Here and there the
jungle is broken by a broad shelving beach on which the ungainly beasts
"love to sun themselves, and to which the females resort to deposit their"
eggs. At the sound of a voice or a paddle in the stream the awkward
"brutes take to the water in terror, for there are few animals more"
"timid than they. When in the water the crocodile floats lazily,"
displaying only three small bumps above the surface--the nostrils and
the horny protruberances above the eyes. Once the pool in which they
float is disturbed they sink to the bottom and lurk there for hours.
Alligator hunting for business purposes is not as yet generally pursued
"""Go down a hundred yards or so,"" she said, ""and there you will find a"
gate. Open it with that key and bring over your animals to the little
"pavilion among the trees by the fountain."""
Upon hearing this the Princess instantly changed her tune. She had got
"her own way, and now it was ""Beautiful Doña Susana! Precious and"
"loveliest companion, when I am Queen you shall have the greatest and"
"handsomest grandee in the kingdom to be your husband, and walk in"
"diamonds and rubies at our court balls! Yes, you shall. I promise it by"
my royal oath. And now I will run to the house kitchen for basins to
"catch the goats' milk in, and my little churn to churn the butter"
"in--and--and----"""
But before she had catalogued half the things that she meant to find and
"bring she departed at the top of her speed, making the air ring with her"
shouts of delight.
"Slowly, and with the meekest dignity, La Giralda did as she was bidden."
"She found the little gate, which, indeed, proved so narrow that she"
could not get her donkey to pass through with his great side-burdens of
"fagots. But as these were not at all heavy, La Giralda herself detached"
"them, and, laying them carefully within the railings, she unhaltered the"
"patient beast and, tying him only with a cord about his neck, left him a"
generous freedom of browsing upon the royal grass-plots and undergrowth.
"The goats, however, perhaps alarmed by the trim daintiness of the place"
"and the unwonted spectacle of unlimited leaves and forage, kept close"
"together. One or two of them, indeed, smelt doubtfully at luxuriant"
"tufts, but as they had only previously seen grass in single blades, and"
"amid Saharas of gravel and sand, the experiment of eating an entire"
mouthful at a time appeared too hazardous and desperate. They were of a
"cautious turn of mind, in addition to which their udders had become so"
acknowledged the authority of the Ancients without any evidence. How
"naïvely he appeals to Antiquity, again and again, to justify some bold"
"feat! He is critical, they say? Were not the Ancients critical? He"
"permits himself to insert digressions? So did the Ancients, etc."
Erasmus is in profound sympathy with that revered Antiquity by his
fundamental conviction that it is the practice of life which matters.
Not he is the great philosopher who knows the tenets of the Stoics or
Peripatetics by rote--but he who expresses the meaning of philosophy by
"his life and his morals, for that is its purpose. He is truly a divine"
"who teaches, not by artful syllogisms, but by his disposition, by his"
"face and his eyes, by his life itself, that wealth should be despised."
To live up to that standard is what Christ himself calls _Renascentia_.
Erasmus uses the word in the Christian sense only. But in that sense it
is closely allied to the idea of the Renaissance as a historical
phenomenon. The worldly and pagan sides of the Renaissance have nearly
"always been overrated. Erasmus is, much more than Aretino or"
"Castiglione, the representative of the spirit of his age, one over whose"
Christian sentiment the sweet gale of Antiquity had passed. And that
very union of strong Christian endeavour and the spirit of Antiquity is
the explanation of Erasmus's wonderful success.

The mere intention and the contents of the mind do not influence the
"world, if the form of expression does not cooperate. In Erasmus the"
quality of his talent is a very important factor. His perfect clearness
"and ease of expression, his liveliness, wit, imagination, gusto and"
humour have lent a charm to all he wrote which to his contemporaries was
"irresistible and captivates even us, as soon as we read him. In all that"
"constitutes his talent, Erasmus is perfectly and altogether a"
"representative of the Renaissance. There is, in the first place, his"
placed--a point in the argument which left an opportunity open to Kant
"to suggest a new development, to ask whether things being found"
"inadequate in producing knowledge, we might not ask if knowledge could"
not be more successful with things. But it is the Scottish lines of
"attempted solution that we wish to follow out, and not the German."
Perhaps they are not so very different.
"Philosophy, as Reid found it, was in a bad way enough, as far as the"
orthodox mind of Scotland was concerned. All justification for belief
"in God, in immortality, in all that was held sacred in a century of"
"much orthodoxy if little zeal, was gone. Such things might be believed"
"in by those who found any comfort in so believing, but to the educated"
"man who had seriously reflected on them, they were anachronisms. The"
"very desperateness of the case, however, seemed to promise a remedy."
"Men could not rest in a state of permanent scepticism, in a world"
utterly incapable of being rationally explained. Even the propounder of
"the theories allowed this to be true; and as for others, they felt that"
"they were rational beings, and this signified that there was system in"
the world.
"A champion arose when things were at their worst in Thomas Reid, the"
"founder, or at least the chiefest ornament, of the so-called Scottish"
School of Philosophy. He it was who set himself to add the principle of
"the coherence of the Universe, and the consequent possibility of"
"establishing Faith once more in the world. Reid, to begin with, instead"
"of looking at Hume's results as serious, regarded them as necessarily"
"absurd. He started a new theory of his own, the theory of Immediate"
"Perception, which signified that we are able immediately to"
"apprehend--not ideas only, but the Truth. And how, we may ask, can this"
be done?
It had been pointed out first of all that sensations as understood by
which proceeding I speak of later in detail. (See Chapter on Questions.)
We now come to the question as to what proportion of _Dramatic
Excitement_ we should present in the stories for a normal group of
"children. Personally, I should like, while the child is very young"
"(I mean in mind, not in years) to exclude the element of dramatic"
"excitement, but though this may be possible for the individual child,"
it is quite Utopian to hope we can keep the average child free from
"what is in the atmosphere. Children crave for excitement, and unless we"
"give it to them in legitimate form, they will take it in any riotous"
"form it presents itself, and if from our experience we can control"
"their mental digestion by a moderate supply of what they demand, we"
may save them from devouring too eagerly the raw material they can so
easily find for themselves.
There is a humorous passage bearing on this question in the story of
"the small Scotch boy, when he asks leave of his parents to present the"
pious little book--a gift to himself from his Aunt--to a little sick
"friend, hoping probably that the friend's chastened condition will make"
him more lenient towards this mawkish form of literature. The parents
"expostulate, pointing out to their son how ungrateful he is, and how"
ungracious it would be to part with his Aunt's gift. Then the boy can
"contain himself no longer. He bursts out, unconsciously expressing the"
normal attitude of children at a certain stage of development: “It's
a _daft_ book ony way; there's naebody gets kilt en't. I like stories
"about folk getting their heids cut off, or stabbit through and through,"
wi' swords an' spears. An' there's nae wile beasts. I like Stories
"about black men gettin' ate up, an' white men killin' lions and tigers"
an' bears an'----”
"Then, again, we have the passage from George Eliot's “Mill on the"
Floss”:
hospitals and also among the brave wives of the soldiers so
fascinating that from the New Year till early June I let all social
"duties slip, so much so that I had a nervous breakdown in June, and"
since then have had to go very slow.
We had a splendid time at our seaside cottage at Negishi this
"afternoon, any amount of our dear brown soldiers round us. There"
are five hundred quartered in that fishing village just now; they
"were resting, bathing, boating, washing their clothes or cooking"
"their chow, but never a rude word or an uncouth action; no"
"rowdyism, but all as civil, quiet, good-tempered, and alert as"
possible; they are a marvel; and my children go in and out among
"them and love them, like I do! I could _kill_ white idiots when I"
hear them speak of those fine fellows as 'an inferior race.' Ye
"gods! 'inferior' with never a camp follower to their name, and"
rapine unknown even after the fiercest fight! What European race
can show a record like that? I wish I could be home for six months
and tell what the soldiers and their wives are--what miracles of
cheerful patience and manly dignity the wounded men are as they lie
"hacked and maimed, sometimes till almost all semblance of manhood"
"is gone, yet never a murmur does any one hear from their lips--no,"
"not if they are armless, legless, and even _blind_. And you would"
not dare condole with them! They say and believe they 'are greatly
"honoured.' When they embrace Christianity, they shame the brightest"
"Christian among us, and I come away from visiting the hospitals"
"feeling so small, so humble, yet at peace with all the world. We"
"have very, very much to learn from this great people."
"This second extract, about a soldier's wife, may come home to your"
readers even more:--
I allow two families a small sum of money every week. One case is
"PHILLIPS, JOHN."
"A carpenter by trade, he sailed from the West Country for Newfoundland in"
a ship that was captured by the pirate Anstis in the _Good Fortune_.
"Phillips soon became reconciled to the life of a pirate, and, being a"
"brisk fellow, he was appointed carpenter to the ship. Returning to England"
"he soon found it necessary to quit the country again, and he shipped"
himself on board a vessel at Topsham for Newfoundland. On arriving at
"Peter Harbour he ran away, and hired himself as a splitter to the"
Newfoundland cod fishery.
"On the night of August 29th, 1723, with four others, he stole a vessel in"
the harbour and sailed away. Phillips was chosen captain. Articles were
"now drawn up and were sworn to upon a hatchet, because no Bible could be"
"found on board. Amongst other laws was the punishment of ""40 stripes"
"lacking one, known as Moses's law, to be afflicted for striking a"
"fellow-pirate."" The last law of the nine casts a curious light on these"
"murderers; it runs: ""If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that"
"Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer"
"present Death."" The pirates, fortified by these laws, met with instant"
"success, taking several fishing vessels, from which they augmented their"
small crew by the addition of several likely and brisk seamen. Amongst
these they had the good fortune to take prisoner an old pirate called John
"Rose Archer, who had served his pirate apprenticeship under the able"
"tuition of the famous Blackbeard, and who they at once promoted to be"
"quartermaster. This quick promotion caused trouble afterwards, for some of"
"the original crew, particularly carpenter Fern, resented it. The pirates"
"next sailed to Barbadoes, that happy hunting ground, but for three months"
"never a sail did they meet with, so that they were almost starving for"
"want of provisions, being reduced to a pound of dried meat a day amongst"
The dozen men who had been slinging freight on the dock hastened up the
"gang-plank or climbed the fenders, while the signal-man clung to the"
"lifting tackle, and, at the piping cry of his whistle, was swung aloft"
out of the very arms of the rioters.
"Above, on the flying bridge, Captain Peasley was bellowing orders; a"
quartermaster was running up the iron steps to the pilot-house; on deck
the sailors were fighting their way to their posts through the ranks of
the raging fishermen and the shrieking confusion of the Orientals; the
"last men aboard, with a ""Heave Ho!"" in unison, slid the gang-plank"
"upward and out of reach. The neighboring roofs, lately so black, were"
"emptying now, the onlookers hastening to join in the attack."
Big George alone remained upon the wharf. As he saw the rush coming he
had ordered his men to abandon their load; then he ran to the
"after-mooring, and, taking slack from a deck hand, cast it off. Back up"
"the dock he went to the forward hawser, where, at a signal, he did the"
"same, moving, toward the last, without excessive hurry, as if in a"
"spirit of bravado. The ship was clear, and he had not cut a hawser. He"
had done his work; all but a ton or two of the cargo was stowed. There
was no longer cause for delay.
"""Get aboard! Are you mad?"" Emerson shouted, but the cry never reached"
"him. Back he came slowly, in front of the press, secure in his"
"tremendous strength, defiance in his every move, a smouldering"
challenge in his eyes; and noting that gigantic frame with its
"square-hewn, flaming face, not one of his enemies dared oppose him. But"
"as he passed they yapped and snarled and jostled at his heels, hungry"
to rend him and only lacking courage.
"As yet the ship, although throbbing to the first pulsations of her"
"engines, lay snug along the piling, but gradually her stern swung off"
"Helena returned from Palestine, bringing with her the stone on which"
"Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin Mary"
"sat down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the temple,"
"the horses drawing these precious relics stood still at this spot,"
"and refused every effort to make them move. Then Christian people,"
"'recognizing the finger of God,' erected a church on this spot--_S."
"Giacomo Scossa Cavalli_--where the stones are still to be seen."""
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Knees.]
"While speaking of interesting stones, I must not omit to mention those"
"in the Church of S. Francesca Romana, near the Forum, containing the"
"marks of the knees of St. Peter--(which show, by the way, that this"
apostle was a giant in size)--when he knelt to pray that Simon Magus
might be dropped by the demons he had invoked to support him in the
air in fulfilment of his promise to fly. One of these stones used to
"lie in the _Via Sacra_, and the water which collected in the two holes"
or knee prints was looked upon as so potent a remedy of disease that
groups of infirm people used to gather around them on the approach of
"a shower. According to the legend, the place where Peter knelt when"
he thus effected the discomfiture of Simon Magus and brought him to
"the ground with such force that his thigh was fractured, never to be"
"healed, was the ancient _Via Sacra_. But, after the priests had removed"
"the stone from the roadway into the church, the inconsiderate and"
"iconoclastic explorers of our day, who have made so many discoveries in"
"their excavations about the Forum, proved that the roadway from which"
"this relic was taken was not the ancient _Via Sacra_ at all, but a more"
modern roadway which had been mistaken for it!
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Head.]
"In the Mamertine Prisons, which are also quite close to the Forum, a"
"au moyen âge_, Bruxelles, 1874, p. 146 _sq._). There is some"
obscurity as to when the foreign Hansards were first permitted to
have warehouses and residences of their own in London. Cp.
"Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. i, §"
"68; and Ashley, i, 105, following Schanz, who dates this privilege"
"in the reign of Henry III, though the merchants of Cologne (_id._"
p. 110) had a _hansa_ or gildhall in London in the reign of Richard
"I. Under whatever conditions, it is clear that London was one of"
the first foreign cities in which the German Hansard traders came
in friendly contact.
A reciprocal and normal egoism furthered as well as thwarted the Hansard
enterprise. Trade in the feudal period being a ground of privilege like
"any other, the monopolied merchants of every city strove to force"
"foreign traders to deal with them only. On the other hand, the English"
nobility sought to deal rather with the foreigner directly than with the
"English middlemen; and thus in each feudal country, but notably in"
"England,[717] the interest of the landed class tended to throw foreign"
"trade substantially in foreign hands, which did their best to hold it."
In the reigns of the Edwards privileges of free trade with natives were
gradually conferred on the foreign traders[718] in the interests of the
"landed class--the only ""general consumers"" who could then make their"
claims felt--in despite of the angry resistance of the native merchant
"class. For the rest, in a period when some maritime English cities, like"
"those of France and Germany, could still carry on private wars with each"
"other as well as with foreign cities,[719] a trader of one English town"
"was in any other English town on all fours with a foreigner.[720] When,"
"therefore, the foreigners combined, their advantage over the native"
trade was twofold.
Naturally the cities least liable to regal interference carried on a
"cosmopolitan co-operation to the best advantage. The Hansa of London,"
"examined it, but there was no writing upon it.  Apparently it was her"
"reserve store of paper, to be used as wanted.  In the French Ministry of"
"Foreign Affairs everything is methodical, especially the preparation of"
"the dossiers.  A certain dossier had once fallen into Kaye's hands, and"
it contained sheets of exactly similar paper to that which I held in my
hand.
"Eagerly I continued my search, striving to discover some writing which"
"might lead me to a knowledge of the truth, but I found nothing.  I had"
"completed an examination of the whole of the contents of the drawers,"
when it occurred to me that there might be some other drawer concealed
there.  Years ago I had been offered an escritoire of this pattern in
"Genoa, and the sun-tanned fellow who endeavoured to induce me to"
purchase it had shown behind the centre drawer in the table a cunningly
contrived cavity where private correspondence might be concealed.
"Therefore I drew out the drawer, sounded the interior at the back, and,"
"finding it hollow, searched about for the spring by which it might be"
"opened.  At last I found it, and next moment drew forth a bundle of"
letters.  They were bound with a blue ribbon that time had faded.  I
"glanced at the superscription of the uppermost, and a thrill of sympathy"
went through me.
Those carefully preserved letters were my own--letters full of love and
"tenderness, which I had written in the days that were dead.  I stood"
"holding them in my hand, my heart full of the past."
"In this narrative, my reader, it is my intention to conceal nothing, but"
"to relate to you the whole, undisguised truth, even though this chapter"
of England's secret history presents a seemingly improbable combination
of strange facts and circumstances.  Therefore I will not hide from you
"the truth that in those moments, as I drew forth one of the letters I"
moderate. Meanwhile the smouldering quarrel with Lee assumed ever more
hateful forms. In vain did Erasmus's English friends attempt to restrain
"their young, ambitious compatriot. Erasmus on his part irritated him"
furtively. He reveals in this whole dispute a lack of self-control and
dignity which shows his weakest side. Usually so anxious as to decorum
"he now lapses into invectives: The British adder, Satan, even the old"
taunt ascribing a tail to Englishmen has to serve once more. The points
at issue disappear altogether behind the bitter mutual reproaches. In
"his unrestrained anger, Erasmus avails himself of the most unworthy"
weapons. He eggs his German friends on to write against Lee and to
"ridicule him in all his folly and brag, and then he assures all his"
English friends: 'All Germany is literally furious with Lee; I have the
greatest trouble in keeping them back'.
Alack! Germany had other causes of disturbance: it is 1520 and the three
great polemics of Luther were setting the world on fire.
Though one may excuse the violence and the petty spitefulness of Erasmus
"in this matter, as resulting from an over-sensitive heart falling"
"somewhat short in really manly qualities, yet it is difficult to deny"
that he failed completely to understand both the arguments of his
adversaries and the great movements of his time.
It was very easy for Erasmus to mock the narrow-mindedness of
conservative divines who thought that there would be an end to faith in
Holy Scripture as soon as the emendation of the text was attempted.
"'""They correct the Holy Gospel, nay, the Pater Noster itself!"" the"
preacher exclaims indignantly in the sermon before his surprised
"congregation. As if I cavilled at Matthew and Luke, and not at those"
"who, out of ignorance and carelessness, have corrupted them. What do"
people wish? That the Church should possess Holy Scripture as correct as
"possible, or not?' This reasoning seemed to Erasmus, with his passionate"
their kids.
"Then, as if in a very vexing dream, she could almost but never quite"
"see, through the thickening mist of the years, once-familiar"
"faces--white men, with swords, in ragged uniforms, and big brown ones"
"with wicked eyes and long, thin guns, glaring down at her over a high"
"wall, through smoke and fire, and fighting, and the acrid reek of"
powder....
"And there remembrance grew blank altogether, until it connected with"
"Captain Dove, on the deck of a slaving-dhow far out of sight of any"
land. She had been only a little child when he had carried her up the
"side of his own ship in his arms, while she laughed gleefully in his"
"face and pulled at his shaggy moustache, but she could still remember"
some of the incidents of that day.
"She had lived on board his successive ships ever since. And ever since,"
"until recently, he had always been very good to her, in his own queer,"
gruff way. He had always treated her as though she were a child of his
"own, shielding her, in so far as he could, from even the knowledge of"
all the evil which he had done up and down the world. She had grown up
in the belief that his despotic guardianship was altogether for her good
and not to be disputed.
"But now--she was no longer a child. And all her old, unquestioning faith"
"in his inherent good intentions, toward her at least, was finally"
shattered. She knew now that he really looked upon her as a mere
"chattel, with a cash value--just as if she had been one of the hapless"
cargo of human cattle confined in the pestiferous hold of the dhow on
whose deck he had found her at play. She knew now that he had bought and
"paid for them as well as her, and sold them again at a fat profit, far"
"across the seas--all but the dumb, deformed black woman whom he had"
the insecurity deter him. In England the servitude which was required of
"him there revolted him. But in the Netherlands themselves, he did not"
"feel at his ease, either: 'Here I am barked at a great deal, and there"
"is no remuneration; though I desired it ever so much, I could not bear"
to stay there long'. Yet he remained for four years.
Erasmus had good friends in the University of Louvain. At first he put
"up with his old host Johannes Paludanus, Rhetor of the University, whose"
house he exchanged that summer for quarters in the College of the Lily.
"Martin Dorp, a Dutchman like himself, had not been estranged from him by"
their polemics about the _Moria_; his good will was of great importance
"to Erasmus, because of the important place Dorp occupied in the"
"theological faculty. And lastly, though his old patron, Adrian of"
"Utrecht, afterwards Pope, had by that time been called away from Louvain"
"to higher dignities, his influence had not diminished in consequence,"
but rather increased; for just about that time he had been made a
cardinal.
Erasmus was received with great complaisance by the Louvain divines.
"Their leader, the vice-chancellor of the University, Jean Briard of Ath,"
"repeatedly expressed his approval of the edition of the New Testament,"
to Erasmus's great satisfaction. Soon Erasmus found himself a member of
the theological faculty. Yet he did not feel at his ease among the
Louvain theologians. The atmosphere was a great deal less congenial to
him than that of the world of the English scholars. Here he felt a
spirit which he did not understand and distrusted in consequence.
"In the years in which the Reformation began, Erasmus was the victim of a"
"great misunderstanding, the result of the fact that his delicate,"
"aesthetic, hovering spirit understood neither the profoundest depths of"
the faith nor the hard necessities of human society. He was neither
mystic nor realist. Luther was both. To Erasmus the great problem of
"curious name of the _Protestant Cæsar_, the pirates burnt out of spite,"
"not because of her name, but because she belonged to Boston, where there"
had lately been a hanging of pirates.
"Blackbeard now sailed north along the American coast, arriving off"
"Charleston, South Carolina. Here he lay off the bar for several days,"
"seizing every vessel that attempted to enter or leave the port, ""striking"
"great Terror to the whole Province of Carolina,"" the more so since the"
"colony was scarcely recovered from a recent visit by another pirate, Vane."
"Being in want of medicines, Teach sent his lieutenant, Richards, on shore"
with a letter to the Governor demanding that he should instantly send off
"a medicine chest, or else Teach would murder all his prisoners, and"
threatening to send their heads to Government House; many of these
prisoners being the chief persons of the colony.
"Teach, who was unprincipled, even for a pirate, now commanded three"
"vessels, and he wanted to get rid of his crews and keep all the booty for"
"himself and a few chosen friends. To do this, he contrived to wreck his"
own vessel and one of his sloops. Then with his friends and all the booty
"he sailed off, leaving the rest marooned on a small sandy island. Teach"
"next sailed to North Carolina, and with the greatest coolness surrendered"
"with twenty of his men to the Governor, Charles Eden, and received the"
Royal pardon. The ex-pirate spent the next few weeks in cultivating an
"intimate friendship with the Governor, who, no doubt, shared Teach's booty"
with him.
A romantic episode took place at this time at Bath Town. The pirate fell
"in love, not by any means for the first time, with a young lady of 16"
"years of age. To show his delight at this charming union, the Governor"
"himself married the happy pair, this being the captain's fourteenth wife;"
though certain Bath Town gossips were heard to say that there were no
"thousand years, among the venomous sycophants, among the idle boasters,"
among the incompetent physicians'.
The self-centred element in Erasmus must needs increase accordingly as
he in truth became a centre and objective point of ideas and culture.
There really was a time when it must seem to him that the world hinged
"upon him, and that it awaited the redeeming word from him. What a"
"widespread enthusiastic following he had, how many warm friends and"
venerators! There is something naïve in the way in which he thinks it
"requisite to treat all his friends, in an open letter, to a detailed,"
rather repellent account of an illness that attacked him on the way back
"from Basle to Louvain. _His_ part, _his_ position, _his_ name, this more"
and more becomes the aspect under which he sees world-events. Years will
come in which his whole enormous correspondence is little more than one
protracted self-defence.
Yet this man who has so many friends is nevertheless solitary at heart.
And in the depth of that heart he desires to be alone. He is of a most
retiring disposition; he is _a recluse_. 'I have always wished to be
"alone, and there is nothing I hate so much as sworn partisans.' Erasmus"
is one of those whom contact with others weakens. The less he has to
"address and to consider others, friends or enemies, the more truly he"
utters his deepest soul. Intercourse with particular people always
"causes little scruples in him, intentional amenities, coquetry,"
"reticences, reserves, spiteful hits, evasions. Therefore it should not"
be thought that we get to know him to the core from his letters. Natures
"like his, which all contact with men unsettles, give their best and"
deepest when they speak impersonally and to all.
After the early effusions of sentimental affection he no longer opens
his heart unreservedly to others. At bottom he feels separated from all
and on the alert towards all. There is a great fear in him that others
fish or looking for iguanas and crabs hidden in the holes of the banks.
"“Physically the Chocoes are a fine and healthy race. They are tall, as"
"compared with the Cuna-Cuna, well proportioned, and with a graceful"
bearing. The men have wiry limbs and faces that are at once kind and
"energetic, while as a rule the girls are plump, fat, and full of"
mischief. The grown women preserve their good looks and attractiveness
"much longer than is generally the case in primitive peoples, in which"
their sex bears the heaviest share of every day’s work.
"“Both males and females have unusually fine white teeth, which they"
sometimes dye black by chewing the shoots of one of the numerous wild
peppers growing in the forests. The skin is of a rich olive-brown color
"and, as usual, a little lighter in women and children. Though all go"
"almost naked, they look fairer than the San Blas Cunas, and some of the"
women would compare advantageously in this respect with certain
Mediterranean types of the white race.
"“The hair is left by all to grow to its natural length, except in a few"
"cases, in which the men have it cropped at the neck. It is coarse and"
"not jet black, as reported of most Indians, but with a reddish hue,"
which is better noticed when the sun is playing through the thick mass.
"“In young children it decidedly turns at times to a blond color, the"
only difference from the Caucasian hair being the pronounced coarseness
of the former. As there are no white people living within a radius of
"fifty miles, but only negroes, mulattoes and zambos, this peculiarity"
"cannot be explained by miscegenation, and may therefore be considered as"
a racial feature of the Choco tribe.
"“In men the every-day dress consists of a scanty clout, made of a strip"
of red calico about one foot broad and five feet long. This clout is
"acres or even more. All fruit is delivered along the railway lines, and"
"the larger growers have tramways, the cars drawn by oxen or mules, to"
carry their fruit to the stipulated point. Notice is given the growers
"of the date on which the fruit will be called for, and within twelve to"
eighteen hours after it has been cut it is in the hold of the vessel. It
"is subjected to a rigid inspection at the docks, and the flaws for which"
whole bunches are rejected would often be quite undiscernible to the
ordinary observer.

"The banana is one of the few fruits which are free from insect pests,"
"being protected by its thick, bitter skin. If allowed to ripen in the"
"open, however, it speedily falls a prey to a multitude of egg-laying"
"insects. The tree itself is not so immune. Lately a small rodent,"
"something like the gopher of our American states, has discovered that"
banana roots are good to eat. From time immemorial he lived in the
"jungle, burrowing and nibbling the roots of the plants there, but in an"
unlucky moment for the fruit companies he discovered that tunneling in
soil that had been worked was easier and the roots of the cultivated
banana more succulent than his normal diet. Therefore a large
importation of scientists from Europe and the United States to find some
way of eradicating the industrious pest that has attacked the chief
"industry of the tropics at the root, so to speak."
[Illustration: COFFEE PLANT AT BOUQUETTE]
Baron Humboldt is said to have first called the attention of civilized
"people to the food value of the banana, but it was one of the founders"
"of the United Fruit Company, a New England sea captain trading to Colon,"
who first introduced it to the general market in the United States. For
a time he carried home a few bunches in the cabin of his schooner for
I shall not say whence the document emanated. I believe it was composed
"by some one who does not lack a certain knowledge of Japan, but who has"
drawn false deductions from his knowledge of similar matters of other
countries. Here is the best example. The document speaks of the native
contingents of Formosa. Now there exist no such forces in Formosa. The
"garrisons of Formosa are sent there from Japan. On the other hand, in"
the colonies belonging to other countries there are generally troops
formed of native contingents. It is notably so in French colonies. The
"author of the document in question, reasoning from these facts, thought"
that it ought to be the same with Formosa.
Has Japan any fear of another alteration of the Treaty of
Shimonoseki being imposed upon her?
"The combined action of Russia, Germany and France, for imposing on"
Japan an alteration of the Treaty of Shimonoseki appears to us to have
been a great error on their parts. I can positively say that there are
many eminent persons in Germany and in France who regret that action.
"Even in Russia, in certain quarters, a belief seems to be entertained"
"that, but for the fault then committed, the present misfortunes would"
"not have happened. As to ourselves, we are not hypnotised by the errors"
then committed by those three powers. We intend to remain friends of
"France, of Germany, and even of Russia, in spite of the injustice we"
"have suffered, provided, of course, those powers wish to keep"
friendship.
We do not overlook the possibility of another combination which those
"powers may have an idea of forming against us, and it behoves us to be"
"watchful. Nevertheless, to tell you my candid opinion, it is scarcely"
possible that a similar intervention should be renewed. I do not think
France would push her docility so far as to follow Germany a second
"time. It would be necessary that Germany should set the example, aided"
It must have been somewhat painful for Erasmus that his friend had so
"far surpassed him in power and position, and was now called to bring by"
diplomatic means the solution which he himself would have liked to see
"achieved by ideal harmony, good will and toleration. He had never"
"trusted Aleander, and was more than ever on his guard against him. As a"
"humanist, in spite of brilliant gifts, Aleander was by far Erasmus's"
"inferior, and had never, like him, risen from literature to serious"
theological studies; he had simply prospered in the service of Church
magnates (whom Erasmus had given up early). This man was now invested
with the highest mediating powers.
To what degree of exasperation Erasmus's most violent antagonists at
Louvain had now been reduced is seen from the witty and slightly
malicious account he gives Thomas More of his meeting with Egmondanus
"before the Rector of the university, who wanted to reconcile them. Still"
"things did not look so black as Ulrich von Hutten thought, when he wrote"
"to Erasmus: 'Do you think that you are still safe, now that Luther's"
"books are burned? Fly, and save yourself for us!'"
Ever more emphatic do Erasmus's protestations become that he has nothing
to do with Luther. Long ago he had already requested him not to mention
"his name, and Luther promised it: 'Very well, then, I shall not again"
"refer to you, neither will other good friends, since it troubles you'."
"Ever louder, too, are Erasmus's complaints about the raving of the monks"
"at him, and his demands that the mendicant orders be deprived of the"
right to preach.
In April 1521 comes the moment in the world's history to which
"Christendom has been looking forward: Luther at the Diet of Worms,"
"holding fast to his opinions, confronted by the highest authority in the"
Empire. So great is the rejoicing in Germany that for a moment it may
necessary. In this matter the aims of the people and the Government are
one. In facing a common danger and in co-operation there must arise
mutual respect and understanding. And perhaps through the very
catastrophe that is threatening the world there may grow up in India a
realisation of community of interest and solidarity as between
Government and people.
A CALL FOR NOBLER PATRIOTISM
A very serious danger is thus seen to be threatening the future of
"India, and to avert it will require the utmost effort of the people."
They have not only to meet the economic crisis but also to protect the
ideals of ancient Aryan civilisation from the destructive forces that
are threatening it. Nothing great can be conserved except through
"constant effort and sacrifice. There is a danger of, regarding the"
mechanical efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the
"opposite danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and activity,"
degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only through the
nobler call of patriotism can our nation realise her highest ideals in
thought and in action; to that call the nation will always respond. He
had the inestimable privilege of winning the intimate friendship of Mr.
"G. K. Gokhale. Before leaving England, our foremost Indian statesman"
"whose loss we so deeply mourn, had come to stay with the speaker for a"
few days at Eastbourne. He knew that this was to be their last meeting.
Almost his parting question to Dr. Bose was whether science had anything
"to say about future incarnations. For himself, however he was certain"
that as soon as he would cast off his worn out frame he was to be born
"once more in the country he loved, and bear all the country that may be"
laid on him in her service. There can be no doubt that there must be
salvation for a country which can count on sons as devoted as Gopal
Krishna Gokhale.
"red croton leaves, and the leaves of the red-blossomed mangrove--red"
"coloured substances being used to make the shell red, magically. Then,"
"passing in front of all the other canoes, he rubs their prows with"
"the bundle of leaves. After that, the canoes at both ends of the"
"row begin to punt along, the row evolving into a circle, through"
"which presently the canoe of the magician passes, punting along its"
"diameter. At this place in the Lagoon, there is a small vatu (coral"
outcrop) called Vitukwayla'i. This is called the vatu of the baloma
"(spirits). At this vatu the magician's canoe stops, and he orders some"
of its crew to dive down and here to begin the gathering of shells.
Some more private magic is performed later on by each canoe on its own
"account. The anchor stone is charmed with some red hibiscus flowers,"
in order to make the spondylus shell red. There is another private
"magic called 'sweeping of the sea,' which, like the magic of the mussel"
"shell, mentioned above, makes the sea clear and transparent. Finally,"
there is an evil magic called 'besprinkling with salt water.' If a
"man does it over the others, he will annul the effects of their magic,"
"and frustrate their efforts, while he himself would arouse astonishment"
and suspicion by the amount of shell collected. Such a man would dive
"down into the water, take some brine into his mouth, and emerging,"
"spray it towards the other canoes, while he utters the evil charm."
So much for the magic and the ceremonial associated with the
"spondylus fishing in the Trobriand Lagoon. In Sanaroa, exactly the"
"same proceedings take place, except that there is no attracting of"
"the reef, probably because they are already at the original seat"
of the kaloma. Again I was told that some of the private magic
would be performed in Sinaketa before the fleet sailed on the Kula
"expedition. The objects medicated would be then kept, well wrapped"
in dried leaves.
work on a large scale will be compelled to adopt.
"To my mind the United Fruit Company, next to the Panama Canal, is the"
great phenomenon of the Caribbean world today. Some day some one with
knowledge will write a book about it as men have written the history of
"the British East India Company, or the Worshipful Company of Hudson Bay"
"Adventurers, for this distinctly American enterprise has accomplished a"
creative work so wonderful and so romantic as to entitle it to equal
literary consideration. Its coöperation with the Republic of Panama and
the manner in which it has followed the plans formulated by the Isthmian
Commission entitles it to attention in a book treating of Panama.

This harbor of the chief banana port of Panama would accommodate a navy]
"The banana business is the great trade of the tropics, and one that"
"cannot be reduced in volume by new competition, as cane sugar was"
checked by beet sugar. But it is a business which requires special
machinery of distribution for its success. From the day the banana is
picked until it is in the stomach of the ultimate consumer the time
"should not exceed three weeks. The fruit must be picked green, as, if"
"allowed to ripen on the trees, it splits open and the tropical insects"
"infect it. This same condition, by the way, affects all tropical fruits."
All must be gathered while still unripe. The nearest wholesale market
"for bananas is New Orleans, five days’ steaming. New York is seven days"
away. That means that once landed the fruit must be distributed to
commission houses and agents all over the United States with the utmost
expedition lest it spoil in transit. There can be no holding it in
"storage, cold or otherwise, for a stronger demand or a higher market."
This means that the corporation must deal with agents who can be relied
upon to absorb the cargoes of the ships as regularly as they arrive.
As teachers and workers it is an incontestable fact that Indian officers
"have distinguished themselves very highly, and anything which"
discriminates between Europeans and Indians in the way of pay and
prospects is most undesirable. A sense of injustice is ill-calculated to
bring about that harmony which is so necessary among all the members of
"an educational institution, professors and students alike."
"83, 632 (VIII) _Relations of the service with the Indian Civil Service"
and with other services._--As regards the relations with the Indian
"Civil Service, I am under the impression that they are somewhat"
"strained, but of this I have no personal experience."
"83, 633 (IX) _Other points._--I have endeavoured to give my opinion on"
the definite questions which have been asked. There is another aspect of
"educational work in India which I think of the highest importance,"
though I am not exactly sure whether it falls within the terms of
reference to the Royal Commission. I think that all the machinery to
improve the higher education in India would be altogether ineffectual
unless India enters the world movement for the advancement of knowledge.
And for this it is absolutely necessary to touch the imagination of the
people so as to rouse them to give their best energies to the work of
"research and discovery, in which all the nations of the world are now"
engaged. To aim at anything less will only end in a lifeless and
mechanical system from which the soul of reality has passed away. On
"this subject I could have said much, but I will confine myself to one"
point which I think at the present juncture to be of importance. The
Government of Bengal has been foremost in a tentative way in encouraging
research. What is necessary is the extension and continuity of this
enlightened policy.
"83, 634. _Supplementary Note._--I would like to add a few remarks to"
"make the meaning of paragraphs 83, 627 and 83, 631 in my note more"
"about themselves, even to quite trifling and unnecessary details. And,"
"of course, each one thinks himself or herself the ONLY or the chief"
"'celebrity' in London, or, for that matter, in the world. I have always"
"to tone down the egotistical part of it a little, especially with"
"authors, for if I were to write out exactly what THEY separately say of"
"their contemporaries, it would be simply frightful! They would be all"
at daggers drawn in no time! I assure you 'interviewing' is often a
"most delicate and difficult business!"""
"""Would it were altogether impossible!"" said Villiers heartily--""But as"
"long as there is a plethora of little authors, and a scarcity of great"
"ones, so long, I suppose, must it continue--for little men love"
"notoriety, and great ones shrink from it, just in the same way that"
"good women like flattery, while bad ones court it. I hope you don't"
bear me any grudge because I consider my friend Alwyn both good and
"great, and resent the idea of his being placed, no matter with what"
"excellent intention soever, on the level of the small and mean?"""
The lady surveyed him with a twinkle of latent approval in her
pale-colored eyes.
"""Not in the least!"" she replied in a tone of perfect good-humor. ""On"
"the contrary, I rather admire your frankness! Still, I think, that as"
"matters stand nowadays, you are very odd,--and I suppose your friend is"
"odd too,--but, of course, there must be exceptions to every rule. At"
"the same time, you should recollect that, in many people's opinion, to"
"be 'interviewed' is one of the chiefest rewards of fame!--"" Villiers"
"shrugged his shoulders expressively. ""Oh, yes, it seems a poor reward"
"to you, no doubt,""--she continued smilingly,--""but there are no end of"
"authors who would do anything to secure the notoriety of it! Now,"
"suppose that, after all, Mr. Alwyn DOES care to submit to the"
"operation, you will let me know, won't you?"""
"on this subject, for the two following experiences gathered from the"
streets which bear indirectly on the subject of story-telling:
"Mrs. Glover was visiting a sick woman in a very poor neighbourhood,"
"and found, sitting on the doorstep of the house, two children, holding"
"something tightly grasped in their little hands, and gazing with much"
expectancy towards the top of the street. She longed to know what they
"were doing, but not being one of those unimaginative and tactless"
"folk who rush headlong into the mysteries of children's doings, she"
passed them at first in silence. It was only when she found them still
in the same silent and expectant posture half-an-hour later that
she said tentatively: “I wonder whether you would tell me what you
"are doing here?” After some hesitation, one of them said, in a shy"
"voice: “We're waitin' for the barrer.” It then transpired that, once a"
"week, a vegetable-and flower-cart was driven through this particular"
"street, on its way to a more prosperous neighbourhood, and on a few"
"red-letter days, a flower, or a sprig, or even a root sometimes fell"
out of the back of the cart; and those two little children were waiting
"there in hope, with their hands full of soil, ready to plant anything"
"which might by golden chance fall that way, in their secret garden of"
oyster-shells.
This seems to me as charming a fairy-tale as any that our books can
supply.
Another time Mrs. Glover was collecting the pennies for the Holiday
Fund Savings Bank from the children who came weekly to her house. She
noticed on three consecutive Mondays that one little lad deliberately
helped himself to a new envelope from her table. Not wishing to
"frighten or startle him, she allowed this to continue for some weeks,"
"and then one day, having dismissed the other children, she asked him"
quite quietly why he was taking the envelopes. At first he was very
"was the pure voice of tragic sorrow. It is in the terrible moment when,"
"after the heroic strain of the sacrifice is over, Virginius realizes the"
"meaning of what he has done. Presumably wild with grief, he raves in"
language so startlingly akin to the ludicrous despairs of Pyramus and
"Thisbe that the modern reader, acquainted with the latter, is almost"
jarred into laughter.
"O cruel hands, O bloody knife, O man, what hast thou done?"
Thy daughter dear and only heir her vital end hath won.
"Come, fatal blade, make like despatch: come, Atropos: come, aid!"
"Strike home, thou careless arm, with speed; of death be not afraid."
"Of such eloquence we might truly say with Theseus, 'This passion, and"
"the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.'"
"In 1562 Tragedy, as we have said, took refuge in an imitation of the"
Senecan stage: translations of Seneca's tragedies had begun to appear in
"1559. _The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex_, or _Gorboduc_, as it was"
"originally and is now most commonly named, marks a new departure for"
English drama. To understand this we ought perhaps to say something
"about the essential features of a Greek tragedy (Seneca's own model),"
and make a note of any special Senecan additions. What strikes one most
in reading a play of Aeschylus is the prominence given to a composite
and almost colourless character known as the Chorus (for though it
"consists of a body of persons, it speaks, for the most part, as one),"
"the absence of any effective action from the stage, the limited number"
"of actors, and the tendency of any speaker to expand his remarks into a"
"set speech of considerable length. This tendency, especially noticeable"
"in the Chorus, whose speeches commonly take the form of chants,"
"encouraged the faculty of generalizing philosophically, so that one is"
constantly treated to general reflections expressive rather of broad
wisdom and piety than of feelings directly and dramatically aroused;
Destiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon
Buonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in
"Corsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the"
hard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It
"was a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the"
Mediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had
previously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.
Yet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was
"granted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the"
"coast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,"
"before the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French"
"commander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did"
Rousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against
this bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his
"compatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the"
"mountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and"
"clan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and"
"after the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking"
with him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With
"these irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but"
accepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French
sway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to
"Ajaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the"
"patriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, ""The Corsican people,"
"when exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced"
"Napoleon Buonaparte[5]."""
"Seeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,"
his sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He
certainly had not the grit of which heroes are made. His seems to have
"been an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as"
"most part submissive; and _if they were not_, the arm of the Church was"
very long and her grasp mortal.... They [the thinkers] could have taught
"Europe _earlier than the Church allowed it to learn_, that the sun does"
"not go round the earth, and that it is the earth which goes round the"
sun.... After the middle of the last century the insurrection against
the pretensions of the Church and against the doctrines of Christianity
"was marked in one of its most important phases by a new, and most"
"significant, feature.... It was an advance both in knowledge and"
in moral motive.... The philosophical movement was represented by
"""Diderot"" [leading the Encyclopaedist circle.]... Broadly stated the"
"great central moral of it was this: that human nature is good, that the"
"world is capable of being made a desirable abiding-place, and that the"
evil of the world _is the fruit of bad education and bad institutions_.
This cheerful doctrine now strikes on the ear as a commonplace and a
"truism. A hundred years ago in France it was a wonderful gospel, _and"
the beginning of a new dispensation.... Into what fresh and unwelcome
sunlight it brought the articles of the old theology... Every social
improvement since has been the outcome of that new doctrine in one form
or another_.... The teaching of the Church paints men as fallen and
depraved. The deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the new fabric
rising was very natural.... The new secular knowledge clashed at
"a thousand points, alike in letter and spirit, with the old sacred"
"lore.... A hundred years ago this perception was vague and indefinite,"
but there was an unmistakable apprehension that _the Catholic ideal
"of womanhood_ was no more adequate to the facts of life, than Catholic"
"views about science, or popery, or labor, or political order and"
"authority.""--Morley."
"And it took the rising infidels to discover the fact. See Morley,"

THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
At the invitation of the President and the committee of the Faridpore
"Industrial Exhibition, Dr. J. C. Bose gave a lecture on the life of his"
"father, the late Babu Bhugwan Chunder Bose, who founded the Exhibition"
"at Faridpore, where he was the sub-divisional officer, 50 years ago. It"
"was published in the Modern Review for February 1917--volume xxi, p."
"221. In course of his address, said Dr. Bose:--"
"It is the obvious, the insistent, the blatant that often blinds us to"
"the essential. And in solving the mystery that underlies life, the"
"enlightenment will come not by the study of the complex man, but through"
"the simpler plant. It is the unsuspected forces, hidden to the eyes of"
"men,--the forces imprisoned in the soil and the stimuli of alternating"
flash of light and the gloomings of darkness these and many others will
be found to maintain the ceaseless activity which we know as the fulness
of throbbing life.
This is likewise true of the congeries of life which we call a society
or a nation. The energy which moves this great mass in ceaseless effort
"to realise some common aspiration, often has its origin in the unknown"
"solitudes of a village life. And thus the history of some efforts, not"
"forgotten, which emanated from Faridpore, may be found not unconnected"
with which India is now meeting her problems to-day. How did these
problems first dawn in the minds of some men who forecast themselves by
"half a century? How fared their hopes, how did their dreams become"
buried in oblivion? Where lies the secret of that potency which makes
"certain efforts apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath"
"the smouldering ashes? Are these dead failures, so utterly unrelated to"
some great success that we may acclaim to day? When we look deeper we
"shall find that this is not so, that as inevitable as in the sequence of"
"bloodiest persecution against the priests of Isis that they ever suffered,"
"in consequence of a scandalous affair in which a matron, a noble and some"
priests of Isis were implicated.
"All these police measures, however, were strangely ineffectual. The"
Egyptian worship was excluded from Rome and her immediate neighborhood in
"theory if not in fact, but the rest of the world remained open to its"
propaganda.[27]
With the beginning of the empire it slowly invaded the center and the north
"of Italy and spread into the provinces. Merchants, sailors, slaves,"
"artisans, Egyptian men of letters, even the discharged soldiers of the"
three legions cantoned in the valley of the Nile contributed to its
"diffusion. It entered Africa by way of Carthage, and the Danubian countries"
through the great emporium of Aquileia. The new province of Gaul was
invaded through the valley of the Rhone. At that period many Oriental
emigrants went to seek their fortunes in these new countries. Intimate
"relations existed between the cities of Arles and Alexandria, and we know"
"that a colony of Egyptian Greeks, established at Nimes by Augustus, took"
the gods of their native country thither.[28] At the beginning of our era
there set in that great movement of conversion that soon established the
worship of Isis and Serapis from the outskirts of the Sahara to the vallum
"of Britain, and from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Danube."
The resistance still offered by the central power could not last much
longer. It was impossible to dam in this overflowing stream whose
thundering waves struck the {84} shaking walls of the _pomerium_ from every
side. The prestige of Alexandria seemed invincible. At that period the city
"was more beautiful, more learned, and better policed than Rome. She was the"
"model capital, a standard to which the Latins strove to rise. They"
"translated the works of the scholars of Alexandria, imitated her authors,"
invited her artists and copied her institutions. It is plain that they had
"""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one"
quartermaster.
"""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though"
"some one were smoking in the forward cabin."""
"""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the"
"fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the"
"quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must"
"be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first"
"cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,"
"and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,"
"and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,"
"then it is all up with us!"""
"""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up"
"with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who"
"knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out"
"of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything"
"in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were"
"useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether"
"he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide"
"behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,"
"he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him"
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
"prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made"
"it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full"
"measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as"
is again one of the unsolved contradictions of his being. He _is_
precipitate and careless; he _wants_ to be careful and cautious; his
"mind drives him to be the first, his nature restrains him, but usually"
only after the word has been written and published. The result is a
continual intermingling of explosion and reserve.
The way in which Erasmus always tries to shirk definite statements
irritates us. How carefully he always tries to represent the
"_Colloquies_, in which he had spontaneously revealed so much of his"
"inner convictions, as mere trifling committed to paper to please his"
friends. They are only meant to teach correct Latin! And if anything is
"said in them touching matters of faith, it is not I who say it, is it?"
"As often as he censures classes or offices in the _Adagia_, princes"
"above all, he warns the readers not to regard his words as aimed at"
particular persons.
"Erasmus was a master of reserve. He knew, even when he held definite"
"views, how to avoid direct decisions, not only from caution, but also"
because he saw the eternal ambiguity of human issues.
"Erasmus ascribes to himself an unusual horror of lies. On seeing a liar,"
"he says, he was corporeally affected. As a boy he already violently"
"disliked mendacious boys, such as the little braggart of whom he tells"
in the _Colloquies_. That this reaction of aversion is genuine is not
contradicted by the fact that we catch Erasmus himself in untruths.
"Inconsistencies, flattery, pieces of cunning, white lies, serious"
"suppression of facts, simulated sentiments of respect or sorrow--they"
may all be pointed out in his letters. He once disavowed his deepest
conviction for a gratuity from Anne of Borselen by flattering her
bigotry. He requested his best friend Batt to tell lies in his behalf.
"He most sedulously denied his authorship of the Julius dialogue, for"
"fear of the consequences, even to More, and always in such a way as to"
"All at once, moved by a sudden impulse, he turned toward the right hand"
"side of the altar, where the great statue of St. Christopher stands,"
and where one of the loveliest windows in the world gleams like a great
"carven gem aloft, filtering the light through a myriad marvellous"
"shades of color, and there he beheld, kneeling on the stone pavement,"
"one solitary worshipper,--a girl. Her hands were clasped, and her face"
"was bent upon them so that her features were not visible,--but the"
"radiance from the window fell on her uncovered golden hair, encircling"
"it with the glistening splendor of a heavenly nimbus,--and round her"
"slight, devotional figure, rays of azure and rose jasper and emerald,"
"flickered in wide and lustrous patterns, like the glow of the setting"
sun on a translucent sea. How very still she was! ... how fervently
absorbed in prayer!
"Vaguely startled, and thrilled by an electric, indefinable instinct,"
"Alwyn went toward her with hushed and reverential tread, his eyes"
"dwelling upon the drooping, delicate outline of her form with"
"fascinated and eager attention. She was clad in gray,--a soft, silken,"
"dove-like gray, that clung about her in picturesque, daintily draped"
"folds,--he approached her still more nearly, and then could scarcely"
refrain from a loud cry of amazement! What flowers were those she wore
"at her breast!--so white, so star-like, so suggestive of paradise"
lilies new-gathered? Were they not the flowers of ARDATH? Dizzy with
"the sudden tumult of his own emotions, he dropped on his knees beside"
"her,--she did not stir! Was she REAL?--or a phantom? Trembling"
"violently, he touched her garment--it was of tangible, smooth texture,"
"actual enough, if the sense of touch could be relied upon. In an agony"
"of excitement and suspense he lost all remembrance of time, place, or"
"custom,--her bewildering presence must be explained,--he must know who"
"she was,--he must speak to her,--speak, if he died for it!"
"""Pardon me!"" he whispered faintly, scarcely conscious of his own words;"
"quittance of earth?--and have I so soon won the privilege to die?"""
"As he spoke, she rose and stood erect, with all the glistening light of"
"the stained window falling royally about her,--and he obeying her mute"
"gesture, rose also and faced her in wondering ecstasy, half expecting"
to see her vanish suddenly in the sun-rays that poured through the
"Cathedral, even as she had vanished before like a white cloud absorbed"
"in clear space. But no! She remained quiet as a tame bird,--her eyes"
"met his with beautiful trust and tenderness,--and when she answered"
"him, her low, sweet accents thrilled to his heart with a pathetic note"
"of HUMAN affection, as well as of angelic sympathy!"
"""Theos, my Beloved, I am ALL THINE!"" she said, a holy rapture vibrating"
"through her exquisite voice.--""Thine now, in mortal life as in"
"immortal!--one with thee in nature and condition,--pent up in"
"perishable clay, even as thou art,--subject to sorrow, and pain, and"
"weariness,--willing to share with thee thine earthly lot,--ready to"
take my part in thy grief or joy! By mine own choice have I come
"hither,--sinless, yet not exempt from sin, but safe in Christ! Every"
"time thou hast renounced the desire of thine own happiness, so much the"
nearer hast thou drawn me to thee; every time thou hast prayed God for
"my peace, rather than thine own, so much the closer has my existence"
"been linked with thine! And now, O my Poet, my lord, my king!--we are"
"together forever more,--together in the brief Present, as in the"
"eternal Future!--the solitary heaven-days of Edris are past, and her"
"mission is not Death, but Love!"""
"Oh, the transcendent beauty of that warm flush upon her face!--the"
"splendid hope, faith, and triumph of her attitude! What strange miracle"
"was here accomplished!--an Angel had become human for the sake of love,"
even as light substantiates itself in the colors of flowers!--the Eden
"lily had consented to be gathered,--the paradise dove had fluttered"
"England the priest solemnly instructs the god-parents of the child,"
"“Ye shall call upon him to hear sermons,” but for the most part the"
"admonition is in vain. As a matter of fact, he picks up his religious"
notions from the newspaper press. And the newspaper press is not now
controlled by men who have a distinct and definite belief in
"Christianity. It depends upon Finance, and financiers have other"
"interests. The assertion of the Psalter, “Notus in Judæa” has been"
"changed now-a-days into an interrogation, and we ask, “In Jewry _is_"
God known?” Let any man who has an intimate acquaintance with the
newspaper world run over in his mind the names of the great newspaper
"proprietors, the editors of our journalistic press, the writers of"
"leading articles, the rising young journalists; and when he has"
"excepted a few Irishmen, who may happen to remain faithful to the"
"Roman Catholic Church, to which they owe their education, how many men"
"will he find who honestly believe the Nicene Creed, and are habitually"
present on the first day of the week at the Breaking of the Bread?
The tone of the daily paper is tolerant. There is no rude hostility
"displayed towards definite Christian doctrines, but the toleration is"
"politely contemptuous. “All wise men are of the same religion, and"
what that religion is wise men do not say.”
It is true that in political matters the press has less power than it
used to have. A magnate of finance cannot now seriously affect public
"opinion, though he may buy newspaper after newspaper, and sweep out"
the editorial staff to supply their places with men of his own choice.
One wealthy wirepuller has other plutocrats to reckon with in
"questions of party politics, and a newspaper man who is dismissed by"
the proprietor of the _Tariff Reformer_ may find another editorial
chair placed at his disposal by the owner of _The Standard of Free
Trade_.
public and attributed to Kodama containing some military indications on
the plan of an invasion of Indo-China is a perfect forgery. I have
exposed elsewhere several technical errors therein which would never
appear in an authentic official document. But whether it is authentic or
"not, I do not attach any importance to the matter, from a political"
point of view at least. It is the duty of all the military and naval
"authorities to keep themselves ready for any emergency. For example,"
France ought to keep herself always prepared for any possible
"difficulties which may arise on her frontiers in the east, and in the"
"south, and on the western coasts; the same with Germany, with Austria,"
"with Italy, even with the United States."
"It appears to me that, if the general staff-office of France or of"
"Germany, or the military or naval authorities of any country whatever,"
were to remain without the least knowledge as to what measure should be
"taken in case of a danger, they would be neglecting their duty to their"
"country. I can then say that all the Japanese officers, both in the army"
and in the navy ought to study constantly the measures which Japan
should take in any emergency. I believe it is the same in every country
"in Europe. This, however, does not belong to the sphere of practical"
politics. It is the duty of statesmen and politicians to maintain a
"friendly relationship with all other countries as far as possible; and,"
"consequently, to keep absolute control over their armies and navies. The"
"army and navy ought to serve as instruments and machines in their hands,"
"and not they, the civilians, become the instruments of the army and"
navy. You may be quite assured that in Japan the army and navy are the
"machines of the statesmen, and that the statesmen are not their"
machines.
Can the fabrication of the so-called Kodama report be demonstrated
by a precise fact?
"Blackwoods' saloon, a recognisable but idealistic likeness,"
"that Ferrier remarked, 'I should call that the pursuit of"
beauty under difficulties.'
"During her infancy Edinburgh had become Mrs. Ferrier's home, though she"
"made frequent visits to Westmorland, of whose dialect she had a"
"complete command. The courtship, however, had been for the most part"
"carried on at the picturesque old house of Gorton, where 'Christopher"
"North' was temporarily residing, and which, situated as it is"
"overlooking the lovely glen made immortal by the name of Hawthornden,"
"in view of Roslin Chapel, and surrounded by old-fashioned walks and"
"gardens, must have been an ideal spot for a romantic couple like the"
Ferriers to roam in. Another friend writes of Wilson's later home at
"Elleray: 'In his hospitable house, where the wits of _Blackwood_"
gathered at intervals and visited individually in season and out of
"season, his daughter saw strange men of genius, such as few young"
"ladies had the fortune to see, and heard talk such as hardly another"
"has the fortune to hear. Lockhart, with his caricatures and his"
"incisive sarcasm, was an intimate of the house. The Ettrick Shepherd,"
"with his plaid and homely Doric, broke in occasionally, as did also De"
"Quincey, generally towards midnight, when he used to sit pouring forth"
"his finely-balanced, graceful sentences far on among the small hours of"
"the morning. There were students, too, year after year, many of them"
"not undistinguished, and some of whom had, we doubt not, ideas of their"
own regarding the flashing hazel eyes of their eloquent Professor's
"eldest daughter.' But her cousin was her choice, though wealth offered"
"no attraction, and neither side had reason to regret the marriage of"
affection.
"At the time of his marriage Ferrier had been practising at the Bar,"
"probably with no great measure of success, seeing that his heart was"
not really set upon his work. It was at this period that he first began
"spacious days of Great Elizabeth, than in a tale of modern life such"
as _Two Years Ago_. His Broad Church Catholic teaching does not always
"find its way to the man in the street, and Henry Kingsley, whose life"
"was so different from that of his illustrious clerical brother, has"
more of human interest in his stories.
"The novel with a purpose, and especially with a religious purpose,"
"fails only, when it does fail, because the author’s knowledge of the"
"average man in his sins and his temptations to sin, is altogether"
incommensurate with his familiarity with the great religious and
social problems of which his story would suggest a solution.
It is often supposed that the men do not care to find the subject of
"religion introduced in fiction, that they resent religion in a novel,"
as children resent the administration of a medicinal powder in a
spoonful of jam; but the expert witness of publishers demolishes this
"opinion. After all, the religious claim is insistent, and life is"
untruly depicted when men and women are described in a story as
uninfluenced by it. There is something unreal in a book which has no
Sundays in it. Critical opinion as expressed in the notices of books
"in the daily papers, and in more weighty reviews, is very misleading,"
simply because the reviewers are generally very young men or women
who know more or less of literature but very little of life. The wrath
of the young man fresh from the University at the success of those
books which do not ignore the spiritual needs of men and women amuses
the experienced author.
“Faugh!” cries Mr. Jones of Balliol; “another batch of sin and
sentiment!” “The Christian creed and the conjugal copula! Religion and
Patchouli!” Yet the critic forgets that those who would reach the
minds and hearts of men must deal with the problems of creed and
"character which men have to solve, each one for himself."
LAST CHANCES.
At an early hour on Sunday all Kirton seemed astir. The streets were
"alive with thronging people, with banners, with inchoate and still"
"amorphous processions, with vendors of meat, drink, and newspapers."
"According to the official arrangements, the proceedings were not to"
"begin till one o'clock, and, in theory, the forenoon hours were left"
"undisturbed; but, what with the people who were taking part in the"
"demonstration, and those who were going to look on, and those who hoped"
"to suck some profit to themselves out of the day's work, the ordinary"
"duties and observances of a Sunday were largely neglected, and Mr."
"Puttock, passing on his way to chapel at the head of his family, did not"
lack material for reprobation in the temporary superseding of religious
obligations.
"The Governor and his family drove to the Cathedral, according to their"
"custom, Eleanor Scaife having pleaded in vain for leave to walk about"
"the streets instead. Lady Eynesford declined to recognise the occasion,"
and Eleanor had to content herself with stealthy glances to right and
left till the church doors engulfed her. The only absentee was Alicia
"Derosne, and she was not walking about the streets, but sitting under"
"the verandah, with a book unopened on her knees, and her eyes set in"
empty fixedness on the horizon. The luxuriant growth of a southern
"summer filled her nostrils with sweet scents, and the wind, blowing off"
"the sea, tempered the heat to a fresh and balmy warmth; the waves"
"sparkled in the sun, and the world was loud in boast of its own beauty;"
"but poor Alicia, like many a maid before, was wondering how long this"
"wretched life was to last, and how any one was ever happy. Faith bruised"
and trust misplaced blotted out for her the joy of living and the
"exultation of youth. If these things were true, why did the sun shine,"
"and how could the world be merry? If these things were true, for her the"
But what shall we say of our president--Ingersoll? A man who in
ten short years has carried mental liberty into every household in
"America--who is without limitations in religion, and modifies justice by"
"no prefix. A man who, with unequaled oratory, champions Freedom--not the"
"""free, white, adult, male"" freedom of Washington. A man who has breasted"
"a whirlwind of detraction and abuse for Justice--not the ""male, adult"""
"justice of Lincoln, but the freedom and justice, without limitation, for"
"""man, woman, and child."""
"With such a leader, what should not be achieved? With such a champion,"
what cause could fail? If the people ever place such a man in the White
"House, the nations of this earth will know, for the first time, the real"
meaning of a free government under secular administration.
"""A government of the people, for the people, by the people,"" will be"
"more than simply a high-sounding phrase, which, read by the light of the"
"past, was only a bitter mockery to a race in chains; and, read by the"
"light of the present, is a choice bit of grim humor to half of a nation"
in petticoats. But so long as the taste of the voter is such that he
prefers to place in the executive chair a type of man so eminently
fitted for private life that when you want to find him you have to
"_shake the chair_ to see if he is in it, just so long will there be no"
danger that the lightning will strike so as to deprive the Freethinkers
of one man in America who could fill the national executive chair
"_full_, and strain the back and sides a little getting in."
"Once more I send greetings to the Convention, with the hope that you may"
"have as grand a time as you ought to have, and that Free thought will"
receive a new impulse from the harmony and enthusiasm of this meeting.
"Sincerely,"
Helen H. Gardener.
shipwrecked crew casting lots for the next occupant of the kettle could
suffer no greater pangs of apprehension than did the Sisters of Saint
Martha on the imminence of an appointment to the orphanage. They had
taken vows of obedience. The Mother Superior's selection was final.
The unfortunate nominee had to pack up her slender belongings and go
"to Willesden. Being a faulty human being (and none but a faulty,"
"unpractical, unsympathetic human being can want, in these days of"
"enlightenment, to shut herself up in a nunnery for the rest of her life,"
with the avowed intention of never doing a hand's turn for any one of
"God's creatures until the day of her death), she invariably regarded"
herself as a holy martyr and ruled the poor little devils of orphans for
"the greater glory of God (magnified entirely, be it understood, by her"
own martyrdom) than for the greater happiness of the poor little devils.
Sister Theophila--in entering into religion the Protestant Sisters
"changed the names by which they were known in the world, according to"
"the time-honoured tradition of an alien church--Sister Theophila, with"
"the temperament of the recluse, had been thrust into this position"
of responsibility against her will. She performed her duties with
scrupulous exactitude and pious resignation. Her ideal of life was the
"ascetic, and to this ideal the twenty orphans had to conform. She did"
not love the orphans.
"Her staff consisted of one matron, a married woman of a much humbler"
class than her own. Possibly she might have loved the orphans had
"she not seen such a succession of them, and her own work been less"
harassing. Twenty female London orphans from disreputable homes are
a tough handful. When you insist on their conformity with the ascetic
"ideal, they become tougher. They will not allow themselves to be loved."
"“And ungrateful!” exclaimed the matron, one day when she was taking"
Risca round the institution. He had expressed to Sister Theophila his
resurrection of Jesus Christ can be set aside as a “cunningly devised
"fable.” No scientific man, who has not deliberately shut himself in an"
hermetically sealed materialism would say to-day that “Miracles” do
not happen. It is a question of evidence.
"And educated men know that there is a science of metaphysics, that"
"there is a science of psychology, that literary criticism is"
"scientific, that the age of a document can be decided, that cumulative"
"evidence cannot be ignored, and that simply to put aside the claims of"
Christianity without examination is absurd.
"But, as Sir Leslie Stephen shows, it is the Christianity of the"
"Catholic creed that matters, and it is this Christianity of which the"
man in the street has need. It gives him a solution of those social
"and ethical problems which he must solve, which he can only neglect at"
"the peril of natural degradation. For example, the position of women"
depends upon our belief or disbelief that Christ was born of the
Virgin Mary. To say that monogamy is the natural evolution of
"humanity, that chastity in the young unmarried man is a product of"
"civilization, that a high conception of a man’s duty to posterity will"
"keep him from harlotry, is simply to show ignorance of history, of"
"human nature, and of the world as it is. A man who talks now-a-days"
about the respect of marriage being a Teutonic contribution to the
"evolution of civilized society, is behind the times. We _know_ that"
"respect for women, and marriage held in honour, are the creations of"
"the Holy Catholic Church, which insists on the Incarnation of the Lord"
Jesus Christ.
But the man in the street does not know these things. The discoveries
"in science, whether physical or psychical, do not reach him. Technical"
treatises are too strong meat for his intellectual digestion. The
pulpit does not appeal to him. At every baptism in the Church of
So after the small and imperious royal maid had been carried screaming
"and battling upstairs by Doña Susana and the globular major-domo, La"
"Giralda, richly rewarded in golden coin of the realm, and with all the"
"requisite information as to the palace, betook herself back to the gate"
"by which she had left the ass. This she loaded again, and driving it"
"before her she retraced her steps past the corner of the palace, and so"
to the porter's lodge by the great gate.
Here she was presently ushered out by a mumbling old woman who informed
"her that her husband and son had both gone to Madrid with the troops,"
"but would undoubtedly return in an hour or two, a statement which with"
her superior information the old gipsy took leave to doubt.
"The town of San Ildefonso lay beneath the chateâu, and to her right as"
La Giralda issued from the gates. The houses were of an aspect at once
"grave and cheerful. They had been built mostly, not for permanent"
"residence, but in order to accommodate the hordes of courtiers and their"
"suites who, in the summer months, followed the royal personages over the"
mountains from Madrid.
"As most of these had fled at the first invasion of the cholera, the"
"windows, at this period of the year generally bright with flowers and"
"shaded with emerald barred _jalousies_, were closely shut up, and upon"
several of the closed doors appeared the fatal black and white notices
"of the municipality, which indicated that there either was or had been a"
case of the plague within the infected walls.
La Giralda went down the streets uttering the long wailing cry which
indicated that she had firewood to sell. But though she could have
"disposed of the milk from the goats over and over again, there appeared"
"but little demand for her other commodity, even though she called,"
"""_Leña-a-a-a! Ah, leña-a-a-a!_"" from one end of San Ildefonso to the"
sanguinary purification imparted by the taurobolium was more efficacious
than baptism. The food that was taken during the mystic feasts was likened
to the bread and wine of the communion; the Mother of the Gods was
"undoubtedly placed above the Mother of God, whose son also had risen again."
"A Christian author, writing at Rome about the year 375, furnishes some"
"remarkable information on this subject. As we have seen, a mournful"
"ceremony was celebrated on March 24th, the _dies sanguinis_ in the course"
of which the _galli_ shed their blood and sometimes mutilated themselves in
"commemoration of the wound that had caused Attis's death, ascribing an"
expiatory and atoning power to the blood thus shed. The pagans {71} claimed
that the church had copied their most sacred rites by placing her Holy Week
at the vernal equinox in commemoration of the sacrifice of the cross on
"which the divine Lamb, according to the church, had redeemed the human"
"race. Indignant at these blasphemous pretensions, St. Augustine tells of"
having known a priest of Cybele who kept saying: _Et ipse Pileatus
"christianus est_--""and even the god with the Phrygian cap [i. e., Attis] is"
"a Christian.""[42]"
But all efforts to maintain a barbarian religion stricken with moral
decadence were in vain. On the very spot on which the last taurobolia took
"place at the end of the fourth century, in the _Phrygianum_, stands to-day"
the basilica of the Vatican.
*       *       *       *       *
There is no Oriental religion whose progressive evolution we could follow
"at Rome so closely as the cult of Cybele and Attis, none that shows so"
plainly one of the reasons that caused their common decay and
"disappearance. They all dated back to a remote period of barbarism, and"
from that savage past they inherited a number of myths the odium of which
"could be masked but not eradicated by philosophical symbolism, and"
practices whose fundamental coarseness had survived from a period of rude
"had time to assert itself, I took advantage of a momentary reaction and"
"said: “Now, children, don't you think we can pay England the tribute"
of going back to England's greatest poet?” In a few minutes we were
"back in the heart of the Forest, and I can still hear the delightful"
intonation of those subdued voices repeating:
Golden lads and girls all must
Like chimney-sweepers come to dust.
It is interesting to note that the same problem that is exercising
us to-day was a source of difficulty to people in remote times. The
"following is taken from an old Chinese document, and has particular"
interest for us to-day.
“The Philosopher Mentius (born 371 B.C.) was left fatherless at a very
tender age and brought up by his mother Changsi. The care of this
prudent and attentive mother has been cited as a model for all virtuous
parents. The house she occupied was near that of a butcher: she
"observed at the first cry of the animals that were being slaughtered,"
"the little Mentius ran to be present at the sight, and that, on his"
"return, he sought to imitate what he had seen. Fearful lest his heart"
"might become hardened, and accustomed to the sights of blood, she"
removed to another house which was in the neighbourhood of a cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to weep upon
"their graves, and make their customary libations. The lad soon took"
pleasure in their ceremonies and amused himself by imitating them.
This was a new subject of uneasiness to his mother: she feared her
son might come to consider as a jest what is of all things the most
"serious, and that he might acquire a habit of performing with levity,"
"and as a matter of routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most"
exact attention and respect. Again therefore she anxiously changed the
"dwelling, and went to live in the city, opposite to a school, where her"
PREFACE:
BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.
AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as
"“unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli"
"about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a"
particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau
"d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with"
"which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then,"
"in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of"
"which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat"
"deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern"
"itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my"
"critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and"
"thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively"
"noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I"
"quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I"
"have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to"
"go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and"
to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a
work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf
of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
"delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between"
"this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and"
"timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once"
"emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince"
"yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two"
standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by
"its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured"
entirely by its art.
There was a very definite purpose in this somewhat rustically cunning
"and half ironical letter. Luther wanted, if possible, to make Erasmus"
"show his colours, to win him, the powerful authority, touchstone of"
"science and culture, for the cause which he advocated. In his heart"
Luther had long been aware of the deep gulf separating him from Erasmus.
"As early as March 1517, six months before his public appearance, he"
wrote about Erasmus to John Lang: 'human matters weigh heavier with him
"than divine,' an opinion that so many have pronounced about"
"Erasmus--obvious, and yet unfair."
"The attempt, on the part of Luther, to effect a _rapprochement_ was a"
reason for Erasmus to retire at once. Now began that extremely ambiguous
policy of Erasmus to preserve peace by his authority as a light of the
world and to steer a middle course without committing himself. In that
attitude the great and the petty side of his personality are
inextricably intertwined. The error because of which most historians
have seen Erasmus's attitude towards the Reformation either in far too
unfavourable a light or--as for instance the German historian
"Kalkoff--much too heroic and far-seeing, is that they erroneously regard"
him as psychologically homogeneous. Just that he is not. His
double-sidedness roots in the depths of his being. Many of his
utterances during the struggle proceed directly from his fear and lack
"of character, also from his inveterate dislike of siding with a person"
or a cause; but behind that is always his deep and fervent conviction
that neither of the conflicting opinions can completely express the
"truth, that human hatred and purblindness infatuate men's minds. And"
with that conviction is allied the noble illusion that it might yet be
"possible to preserve the peace by moderation, insight, and kindliness."
In April 1519 Erasmus addressed himself by letter to the elector
"Frederick of Saxony, Luther's patron. He begins by alluding to his"
"For some time his tin-machines had been busy, night and day, turning"
"out great heaps of gleaming cans, while the carpenters and machinists"
"completed their tasks. The gill-netters were overhauling their gear,"
the beach was lined with fishing-boats. On the dock great piles of
"seines and drift-nets were being inspected. Three miles below, Big"
"George, with a picked crew and a pile-driver, was building the"
"fish-trap. It consisted of half-mile ""leads,"" or rows of piling, capped"
"with stringers, upon which netting was hung, and terminated in"
"""hearts,"" ""corrals,"" and ""spillers,"" the intricate arrangements of"
webbing and timbers out of which the fish were to be taken.
It was for the title to the ground where his present operations were
going forward that George had been so cruelly disciplined by the
"""interests;"" and while he had held stubbornly to his rights for years"
"in spite of the bitterest persecution, he was now for the first time"
able to utilize his site. Accordingly his exultation was tremendous.
"As for Boyd, the fever in his veins mounted daily as he saw his dream"
assuming concrete form. The many problems arising as the work advanced
afforded him unceasing activity; the unforeseen obstacles which were
"encountered hourly required swift and certain judgment, taxing his"
"ingenuity to the utmost. He became so filled with it all, so steeped"
"with the spirit of his surroundings, that he had thought for nothing"
"else. Every dawn marked the beginning of a new battle, every twilight"
"heralded another council. His duties swamped him; he was worried,"
"exultant, happy. Always he found Cherry at his shoulder, unobtrusive"
"and silent for the most part, yet intensely observant and keenly alive"
"to every action. She seemed to have the faculty of divination, knowing"
"when to be silent and when to join her mood with his, and she gave him"
valuable help; for she possessed a practical mind and a masculine
"aptitude for details that surprised both him and George. But, rapidly"
condemnation from outside is useless and is always discredited. In all
"probability the Allies and the Central Powers are both equally bad, and"
"to denounce the enemy only is mere yelping with the rest of the savage,"
"vindictive pack."""
"""That is true, but what is the good of saying it, or thinking it!"
"Ignorance, prejudice, and intellectual dishonesty are far stronger than"
you are. The depravity of mankind is such that only failure and
humiliation will carry conviction. Mere words are only wasted. If any
"nation is completely defeated in this war, then its people will rise"
"against its rulers, whether they are guilty or not, and they will fix"
all the responsibility of war upon them and upon themselves. There will
be a frenzy of self-accusation--whether just or unjust it doesn't
"matter--and as for the victors, they will say: 'Our enemies admit their"
"guilt, so what further proof is needed?' Where the _real_ guilt is, that"
is an irrelevant and trivial question. Success or failure will be the
sole ultimate criterion. There is only one hope for the world--that
failure will be so evenly distributed that there will be anxious
heart-searchings in every country. Failure alone makes ignorant people
"think. Success is taken for granted. Even after a single battle lost,"
"the Press is full of explanations and excuses, but after a battle won,"
"there is only complacency and self-glorification, and questions as to"
"the why and wherefore are considered out of place or even treasonable."""
"When we parted I was seized with a feeling of intense loneliness, but"
nevertheless I realized with satisfaction that I was not entirely alone.
I also gave up the idea of enjoying my leave and conceived a deep
aversion for all pleasures and amusements.
"The next day I wandered into the British Museum. The 600,000 volumes"
that surrounded me on the shelves of the reading-room had a depressing
"effect. I took out a few books, but was too distracted for serious"
miracle that the British Empire survived that life and death struggle
against a man of superhuman genius who was determined to effect its
overthrow. I have called special attention to the extent and
pertinacity of Napoleon's schemes for the foundation of a French
"Colonial Empire in India, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia; and"
"there can be no doubt that the events of the years 1803-13 determined,"
"not only the destinies of Europe and Napoleon, but the general trend"
of the world's colonization.
As it has been necessary to condense the story of Napoleon's life in
"some parts, I have chosen to treat with special brevity the years"
"1809-11, which may be called the _constans aetas_ of his career, in"
order to have more space for the decisive events that followed; but
even in these less eventful years I have striven to show how his
Continental System was setting at work mighty economic forces that
"made for his overthrow, so that after the _débâcle_ of 1812 it came to"
be a struggle of Napoleon and France _contra mundum_.
"While not neglecting the personal details of the great man's life, I"
have dwelt mainly on his public career. Apart from his brilliant
"conversations, his private life has few features of abiding interest,"
perhaps because he early tired of the shallowness of Josephine and the
Corsican angularity of his brothers and sisters. But the cause also
"lay in his own disposition. He once said to M. Gallois: ""Je n'aime pas"
"beaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin rien: _je suis tout à fait un"
"être politique_."" In dealing with him as a warrior and statesman, and"
"in sparing my readers details as to his bolting his food, sleeping at"
"concerts, and indulging in amours where for him there was no glamour"
"of romance, I am laying stress on what interested him most--in a word,"
I am taking him at his best.
"I could not have accomplished this task, even in the present"
"expect an appreciation of fine humour from a normal child, that is,"
from an elemental mind. It seems as if the rough-and-tumble element
were almost a necessary stage through which children must pass--a
"stage, moreover, which is normal and healthy; but up to now we have"
"quite unnecessarily extended the period of elephantine fun, and though"
we cannot control the manner in which children are catered for along
"this line in their homes, we can restrict the folly of appealing too"
strongly or too long to this elemental faculty in our schools. Of
"course, the temptation is strong, because the appeal is so easy. But"
there is a tacit recognition that horse-play and practical jokes are
no longer considered an essential part of a child's education. We note
"this in the changed attitude in the schools, taken by more advanced"
"educationists, towards bullying, fagging, hazing, etc. As a reaction,"
"then, from more obvious fun, there should be a certain number of"
"stories which make appeal to a more subtle element, and in the chapter"
"on the questions put to me by teachers on various occasions, I speak"
more in detail about the educational value of a finer humour in our
stories.
At some period there ought to be presented in our stories the
"superstitions connected with the primitive history of the race, dealing"
"with the Fairy (proper), giants, dwarfs, gnomes, nixies, brownies"
and other elemental beings. Andrew Lang says: “Without our savage
ancestors we should have had no poetry. Conceive the human race born
"into the world in its present advanced condition, weighing, analysing,"
examining everything. Such a race would have been destitute of poetry
and flattened by common sense. Barbarians did the _dreaming_ of the
world.”
But it is a question of much debate among educationists what should
be the period of the child's life in which these stories are to be
presented. I myself was formerly of opinion that they belonged to
"assailant, felling him like an ox, then he in turn was blotted out by a"
"surge of rioters. But there was little time for observation, as the"
scene was changing with kaleidoscopic rapidity and there was the
ever-present necessity of self-protection. Seeing Clyde's helpless
"condition, Emerson shouted:"
"""Come on! I'll help you aboard the ship."" He found a hardwood club"
beneath his feet--one of those cudgels that are used in pounding
rope-slings and hawsers--and with it cleared a pathway for Clyde and
"himself. But while still at a distance from the ship's gangway, he"
"suddenly spied the man in the gray suit, who had climbed upon one of"
"the freight-piles, whence he was scanning the crowd. The man likewise"
"recognized Emerson, and pointed him out, crying something"
"unintelligible in the tumult, then leaped down from his vantage-point."
"The next instant Boyd saw him approaching, followed by several others."
"He endeavored to hustle Clyde to the big doors ahead of the oncomers,"
"but being intercepted, backed against the shed wall barely in time to"
beat off the foremost.
His nearest assailant had armed himself with an iron bar and endeavored
"to guard the first blow with this instrument, but it flew from his"
"grasp, and he sustained the main force of the impact on his forearm."
"Then, though Boyd fell back farther, the others rushed in and he found"
himself hard beset. What happened thereafter neither he nor Alton
"Clyde, who was half-dazed to begin with, ever clearly remembered, for"
in such over-charged instants the mental photograph is wont to be
either unusually distinct or else fogged to such a blur that only the
high-lights stand out clearly in retrospect.
"Before he had recognized the personal nature of the assault, Emerson"
found himself engaged in a furious hand-to-hand struggle where a want
"of room hampered the free use of his cudgel, and he was forced to rely"
"frank amazement and admit itself surpassed! Here, indeed, was all the"
"vital, colorful magnetism of a type that men are quick to die for!"
Her gown--yet how can man describe a woman's gown? It was a very rich
"affair and added to the picture. But this I did observe distinctly, that"
in revealing her arms and shoulders there was no slightest hint of that
abandonment of _décolleté_ which denotes the approach of feminine
"despair, nor was the color in her cheeks a result of anything less pure"
than the kiss of air and sunshine.
"Her _vis-à-vis_, almost too old to have been her father, was one of"
"those whose nationality is difficult to place. His hair, mustache and"
"Vandyke beard were gray; he was tall, thin, and perhaps seventy-five"
years old. His complexion impressed one most unpleasantly because of its
"sallow, almost yellow, hue; and although I had not yet had a full-face"
view of him I intuitively knew that his teeth were long and thin and
"yellow. A slight palsy never let his head be still, as if some"
"persistent agent were making him deny, eternally deny, an inarticulate"
accusation--as accusations of the conscience perforce must be.
"Despite his grumpy silence he showed an air of repressed excitement,"
"sending frequent, shifty glances over the room; and that he possessed"
the temper of a fiend I did not doubt after seeing him turn upon the
waiter for some trifling omission and reduce that usually placid
"individual to a state of amazed incapacity. Then a quick, really a"
"pitiful, look of terror came into the girl's eyes as she shrank back in"
her chair. It lasted but a second before she was again making herself
"agreeable--acting, of course--and I wanted to cross to him and demand:"
"""Why is this lady afraid?"""
I hated the man; at first sight I loathed him. It was one of those
antipathies sometimes observed in dogs that see each other from a
Everywhere in the empire the two religions lived in intimate communion. By
"ingratiating themselves with the Phrygian priests, the priests of Mithra"
obtained the support of an official institution and shared in the
"protection granted by the state. Moreover, men alone could participate in"
"the secret ceremonies of the Persian liturgy, at least in the Occident."
"Other {66} mysteries, to which women could be admitted, had therefore to be"
"added in order to complete them, and so the mysteries of Cybele received"
the wives and daughters of the Mithraists.
This union had even more important consequences for the old religion of
Pessinus than the partial infusion of Judaic beliefs had had. Its theology
"gained a deeper meaning and an elevation hitherto unknown, after it had"
adopted some of the conceptions of Mazdaism.
"The introduction of the taurobolium in the ritual of the _Magna Mater_,"
"where it appeared after the middle of the first century, was probably"
"connected with this transformation. We know the nature of this sacrifice,"
of which Prudentius gives a stirring description based on personal
"recollection of the proceeding. On an open platform a steer was killed, and"
"the blood dropped down upon the mystic, who was standing in an excavation"
"below. ""Through the thousand crevices in the wood,"" says the poet, ""the"
bloody dew runs down into the pit. The neophyte receives the falling drops
"on his head, clothes and body. He leans backward to have his cheeks, his"
"ears, his lips and his nostrils wetted; he pours the liquid over his eyes,"
"and does not even spare his palate, for he moistens his tongue with blood"
"and drinks it eagerly.""[33] After submitting to this repulsive sprinkling"
he offered himself to the veneration of the crowd. They believed that he
"was purified of his faults, and had become the equal of the deity through"
his red baptism.
Although the origin of this sacrifice that took place in the mysteries of
"Cybele at Rome is as yet shrouded in obscurity, recent discoveries enable"
"Mr. P. A. Barnett, in his book on the “Commonsense of Education,” says,"
alluding to Fairy Tales:
"“Children will _act_ them but not act _upon_ them, and they will"
not accept the incidents as part of their effectual belief. They
"will imagine, to be sure, grotesque worlds, full of admirable and"
interesting personages to whom strange things might have happened.
So much the better; this largeness of imagination is one of the
possessions that distinguish the better nurtured child from others less
fortunate.”
The following passage from Stevenson's essay on _Child Play_[41] will
furnish an instance of children's aptitude for creating their own
dramatic atmosphere:
"“When my cousin and I took our porridge of a morning, we had a device"
"to enliven the course of a meal. He ate his with sugar, and explained"
it to be a country continually buried under snow. I took mine with
"milk, and explained it to be a country suffering gradual inundation."
You can imagine us exchanging bulletins; how here was an island still
"unsubmerged, here a valley not yet covered with snow; what inventions"
were made; how his population lived in cabins on perches and travelled
"on stilts, and how mine was always in boats; how the interest grew"
furious as the last corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and
"grew smaller every moment; and how, in fine, the food was of altogether"
"secondary importance, and might even have been nauseous, so long as we"
seasoned it with these dreams. But perhaps the most exciting moments I
"ever had over a meal, were in the case of calves' feet jelly. It was"
"hardly possible not to believe, and you may be quite sure, so far from"
"trying it, I did all I could to favour the illusion--that some part of"
"it was hollow, and that sooner or later my spoon would lay open the"
"secret tabernacle of that golden rock. There, might some Red-Beard"
doubling back to the eastward and laying a cautious course along the
second leg of the journey.
Once through the ragged barrier that separates the North Pacific from
"her sister sea, the dank breath of the Arctic smote them fairly. The"
breeze that wafted out from the north brought with it the chill of
"limitless ice-fields, and the first night found them hove-to among the"
outposts of that shifting desert of death which debouches out of
"Behring Straits with the first approach of autumn, to retreat again"
only at the coming of reluctant summer. From the crow's-nest the
lookout stared down upon a white expanse that stretched beyond the
"horizon. At dawn they began their careful search, feeling their way"
eastward through the open lanes and tortuous passages that separated
"the floes, now laying-to for the northward set of the fields to clear a"
"path before them, now stealing through some narrow lead that opened"
into freer waters.
"_The Bedford Castle_ was a steel hull whose sides, opposed to the jaws"
"of the ponderous masses, would have been crushed like an eggshell in a"
"vise. Unlike a wooden ship, the gentlest contact would have sprung her"
"plates, while any considerable collision would have pierced her as if"
she had been built of paper. Appreciating to the full the peril of his
"slow advance, Captain Peasley did all the navigating in person; but"
eventually they were hemmed in so closely that for a day and a night
"they could do nothing but drift with the pack. In time, however, the"
winds opened a crevice through which they retreated to follow the outer
"limits farther eastward, until they were balked again."
"Opposed to them were the forces of Nature, and they were wholly"
"dependent upon her fickle favor. It might be a day, a week, a month"
"before she would let them through, and, even when the barrier began to"
"yield, another ship, a league distant, might profit by an opening which"
"well as several other small independents, from disposing of a single"
plank.
The lumberjacks were not slow in putting two and two together. They
remembered rumors current in the big woods for many months of the fight
which had started between the trust and this man who was their boss. It
"was a fight to the finish, people said, in which one side or the other"
"must go under, From all appearances it looked to these earnest,"
simple-minded woodsmen as if Bainbridge would be vanquished unless he
could get that drive safely into the mill booms; and to that end they
"strained every nerve. They toiled from dawn to dark, staggering into"
camp each night so utterly weary that they sometimes fell asleep with
their supper half eaten before them; only to be up before daybreak to do
it all over again.
"It was a period of stress and strain, but it ended at last when the"
"drive was ushered into the Penobscot, to be seized by the strong current"
"and urged on toward the mills at Lancaster, that goal which had seemed a"
"little while ago so unattainable, yet which was now so near."
That very afternoon was perpetrated the crowning outrage. Bainbridge was
shot at from the bushes--shot at deliberately with an intent to kill
which was defeated only by the miracle of chance which made him bend
over to tighten a shoe lace at the precise moment of firing.
"Wild with fury, the men who were present dashed in pursuit of the"
"would-be assassins, but to no purpose. They were in the land of"
"civilization now, where there were motor cars. By the time the crowd of"
"rivermen had surged up the bank and plunged through the undergrowth, the"
"rascally tools of the trust were well away, leaving their pursuers to"
rage impotently that there was not a gun in the party with which the
tires could be punctured and the car stopped.
"luckless Scotchmen, and in the 200 years that have elapsed they have"
clung to the tradition of friendship for the Briton and hatred for the
Spaniard. Dr. Pittier reports having found that Queen Victoria occupied
"in their villages the position of a patron saint, and that they refused"
to believe his assertion that she was dead. His account of the attitude
"of these Indians toward outsiders, recently printed in the National"
"Geographic Magazine, is an authoritative statement on the subject:"
“The often circulated reports of the difficulty of penetrating into the
"territory of the Cuna-Cuna are true only in part”, he says. “The"
"backwoods aborigines, in the valleys of the Bayano and Chucunaque"
"rivers, have nourished to this day their hatred for all strangers,"
especially those of Spanish blood. That feeling is not a reasoned one:
it is the instinctive distrust of the savage for the unknown or
"inexplicable, intensified in this particular case by the tradition of a"
long series of wrongs at the hands of the hated Spaniards.
"“So they feel that isolation is their best policy, and it would not be"
safe for anybody to penetrate into their forests without a strong escort
"and continual watchfulness. Many instances of murders, some confirmed"
"and others only suspected, are on record, and even the natives of the"
San Blas coast are not a little afraid of their brothers of the
mountains.
"“Of late, however, conditions seem to have bettered, owing to a more"
frequent intercourse with the surrounding settlements. A negro of La
"Palma, at the mouth of the Tuyra River, told me of his crossing, some"
"time ago, from the latter place to Chepo, through the Chucunaque and"
"Bayano territories, gathering rubber as he went along with his party. At"
the headwaters of the Canaza River he and his companions were held up by
"the ‘bravos’, who contented themselves with taking away the rubber and"
part of the equipment and then let their prisoners go with the warning
"began to prescribe them, not only as a vehicle for the exhibition of"
"wholesome but unattractive information, but as having a remedial value"
"of their own. “The intellectual anodyne of the nineteenth century,” I"
remember that somebody called them--perhaps it was Sir Arthur Helps.
It came about that those who had a secret and timid predilection for
"the story-book, but blushed a little if at Mudie’s counter they"
"ventured to ask for a novel, found that their ordinary reading of"
Biography and Memoirs revealed some unsuspected sympathies of the
illustrious and wise. Who would have thought that Darwin devoured
"novels and Dean Church did not disdain them, and that Mr. Gladstone"
sat up all night to finish _John Inglesant_? The respectable
"pater-familias has long ceased to proscribe novel reading, and the"
most austere biographer no longer hides as a revelation of weakness
"his hero’s literary divertisements. Finally, in this year of Grace"
1906 we are boldly told that Archbishop Temple could stand an
"examination in Miss Yonge’s novels, and on one occasion was heard"
keenly discussing with Lord Rosebery the careers of the May family in
the _Daisy Chain_ as though they were living acquaintances. From being
"recognized as a recreation the novel has developed into a power, and"
Charles Dickens was a pioneer in its progress. It is the custom
amongst certain “superior persons” to sneer at the novel with a
"purpose, and to suggest that authors attained remunerative results by"
taking some subject which was already ripe for discussion and weaving
round it a web of fiction.
"Undoubtedly there is danger to-day of such artifice, but I maintain"
that the great reforms of the past century owed much to writers whose
purpose was perfectly innocent. Cardinal Newman has told us of the
"literary influence of Sir Walter Scott, who turned men’s minds in the"
direction of the Middle Ages.
"“The general need,” he said, “of something deeper and more attractive"
the saints were exposed if they find them too often preserved at the
last moment from the punishment they were brave enough to undergo. For
"one or other of these reasons, I should avoid the detailed history of"
"St. Juliana, St. Vincent, St. Quintin, St. Eustace, St. Winifred, St."
"Theodore, St. James the More, St. Katharine, St. Cuthbert, St. Alphage,"
"St. Peter of Milan, St. Quirine and Juliet, St. Alban and others."
The danger of telling children stories connected with sudden
conversions is that they are apt to place too much emphasis on the
"process, rather than the goal to be reached. We should always insist on"
the splendid deeds performed after a real conversion--not the details
"of the conversion itself; as, for instance, the beautiful and poetical"
work done by St. Christopher when he realised what work he could do
most effectively.
"On the other hand, there are many stories of the saints dealing with"
actions and motives which would appeal to the imagination and are not
"only worthy of imitation, but are not wholly outside the life and"
experience even of the child.[30]
Having protested against the elephantine joke and the too-frequent
"use of exaggerated fun, I now endeavour to restore the balance by"
suggesting the introduction into the school curriculum of a few purely
grotesque stories which serve as an antidote to sentimentality or
"utilitarianism. But they must be presented as nonsense, so that the"
"children may use them for what they are intended, as pure relaxation."
Such a story is that of “The Wolf and the Kids.” I have had serious
"objections offered to this story by several educational people, because"
"of the revenge taken by the goat on the wolf, but I am inclined to"
"think that if the story is to be taken as anything but sheer nonsense,"
it is surely sentimental to extend our sympathy towards a caller who
has devoured six of his hostess' children. With regard to the wolf
"undergraduates, many of the thirty demies being graduates"
and non-resident. In the year of his matriculation there
"were only ten gentlemen-commoners; thus, as far as"
"undergraduates went, the College was a small one."
[3] Mr. Shirley was Member of Parliament for South
"Warwickshire, a well-known genealogist, and the author of"
_The Noble and Gentle Men of England_.
"It is known that Ferrier took his Bachelor's degree in 1832, and that"
he had by that time managed to acquire a very tolerable knowledge of
"the classics and begun to study philosophy, so that his time could not"
"have been entirely idle. For the rest, he probably passed happily"
"through his years at College, as many others have done before and after"
"him, without allowing more weighty cares to dwell upon his mind."
"Another friend of after days, the late Principal Tulloch, after noting"
the fact that Oxford had not then developed the philosophic spirit
"which in recent years has marked her schools, and which had not then"
"taken root any more than the High Church movement which preceded it,"
"goes on: 'It may be doubted, indeed, whether Oxford exercised any"
definite intellectual influence on Professor Ferrier. He had imbibed
"his love for the Latin poets before he went there, and his devotion to"
Greek philosophy was an after-growth with which he never associated his
Magdalen studies. To one who visited the College with him many years
"afterwards, and to whom he pointed out with admiration its noble walks"
"and trees, his associations with the place seemed to be mainly those of"
amusement. There is reason to think that few of those who knew him at
Magdalen would have afterwards recognised him in the laborious student
"at St. Andrews, who for weeks together would scarcely cross the"
"threshold of his study; and yet to all who knew him well, there was"
nevertheless a clear connection between the gay gownsman and the
hard-working Professor.'
"origin. If they were not native, at least they were soon naturalised,"
and that for the simple reason that they satisfied the religious
"cravings of the Greek race. The essential spirit of their worship,"
"whatever the accidents of form and expression, was the spirit of the"
"old Pelasgian worship of Demeter; and therefore, though Dionysus may"
"have been an immigrant from northern barbarous peoples, the Greeks did"
not hesitate to give him room and honour beside Demeter in the very
"sanctuary of Eleusis. Similar, we may well believe, was the lot of"
"other foreign gods and rites. Whencesoever derived, they owed their"
reception in Greece to the fact that their character appealed to
certain native religious instincts of the Greek folk. Once transplanted
"to Hellenic soil, they were soon completely Hellenized; those elements"
which were foreign or distasteful to Greek religion were quickly
"eradicated or of themselves faded into oblivion, while all that"
accorded with the Hellenic spirit throve into fuller perfection; for
the character of a deity and of a cult depends ultimately upon the
character of the worshippers.
It is fair therefore to treat of Aphrodite as of a genuinely Greek
"deity; for, though she may have entered Greece from Eastern lands,"
doubtless long before the Homeric age her worship no less than her
personality was permeated with the spirit of genuinely Greek religion.
Too well known to need re-telling here is the story of how--to use the
words of Theocritus once more--‘the beautiful Cytherea was brought by
"Adonis, as he pastured his flock upon the mountain-side, so far beyond"
"the verge of frenzy, that not even in his death doth she put him from"
her bosom[1456].’ Such was the plot of one of the most famous religious
dramas of old time. And what was its moral for those who had ears to
hear? Surely that the beloved of the gods may hope for wedlock with
them in death.
It was certainly in this sense that Clement of Alexandria understood
"elaborate, but one would think rather painful, since they include the"
breaking of a front tooth in sign that they are ready for marriage. They
marry young and mothers at twelve years are not uncommon.
Once a year the Guaymies have a great tribal feast--“balceria” the
Spaniards call it. Word is sent to all outlying huts and villages by a
"mystic symbol of knotted rags, which is also tied to the branches of the"
trees along the more frequented trails. On the appointed day several
hundred will gather on the banks of some river in which a general bath
"is taken, with much frolicking and horseplay. Then the women employ"
"several hours in painting the men with red and blue colors, following"
"the figures still to be seen on the old pottery, after which the men"
garb themselves uncouthly in bark or in pelts like children “dressing
up” for a frolic. At night is a curious ceremonial dance and game called
"balsa, in which the Indians strike each other with heavy sticks, and are"
knocked down amid the pile of broken boughs. The music--if it could be
"so called--the incantations of the wisemen, the frenzy of the dancers,"
"all combine to produce a sort of self-hypnotism, during which the"
Indians feel no pain from injuries which a day later often prove to be
very serious.

"There are a multitude of distinct Indian tribes on the Isthmus, each"
"with its own tribal government, its distinctive customs and its allotted"
"territory, though boundaries are, of course, exceedingly vague and the"
territories overlap. The Smithsonian pamphlet enumerates 21 such tribes
in the Darien region alone. But there seems to be among them no such
condition of continual tribal warfare as existed between our North
American Indians as long as they survived in any considerable numbers
the aggressions of the white settlers. It is true that the historian of
Balboa’s expedition records that the great leader was besought by
"Hadad, in a considerable part of Syria besides. The Greeks considered her"
"as the principal Syrian goddess ([Greek: Suria thea]), and in the Latin"
"countries she was commonly known as _dea Syria_, a name corrupted into"
_Iasura_ by popular use.
We all remember the unedifying descriptions of her itinerant priests that
"Lucian and Apuleius[1] have left. Led by an old eunuch of dubious habits, a"
crowd of painted young men marched along the highways with an ass that bore
an elaborately adorned image of the goddess. Whenever they passed through a
"village or by some rich villa, they went through their sacred exercises. To"
the shrill accompaniment of their Syrian flutes they turned round and
"round, and with their heads thrown back fluttered about and gave vent to"
hoarse clamors until vertigo seized them and insensibility was complete.
"Then they flagellated themselves wildly, struck themselves with swords and"
shed their blood in front of a rustic crowd which pressed closely about
"them, and finally they took up a profitable collection from the wondering"
"spectators. They received jars of milk and wine, cheeses, flour, bronze"
"coins of small denominations and even some silver pieces, all of which"
disappeared in the folds of their capacious robes. If opportunity presented
they knew how to increase their profits by means of clever thefts or by
making commonplace predictions for a moderate consideration.
"This picturesque description, based on a novel by {105} Lucius of Patras,"
is undoubtedly extreme. It is difficult to believe that the sacerdotal
corps of the goddess of Hierapolis should have consisted only of charlatans
and thieves. But how can the presence in the Occident of that begging and
low nomadic clergy be explained?
It is certain that the first worshipers of the Syrian goddess in the Latin
world were slaves. During the wars against Antiochus the Great a number of
"prisoners were sent to Italy to be sold at public auction, as was the"
"custom, and the first appearance in Italy of the _Chaldaei_[2] has been"
"advantages whereof others are incapable.""[812] And Sir Josiah Child, of"
"the same generation, declared similarly against transcendentalism in"
"such matters. ""If any,"" he roundly declares, ""shall tell me it is the"
"nature of those people to be thrifty, I answer, _all men by nature are"
"alike_; it is only laws, custom, and education that differ men; their"
"nature and disposition, and the disposition of all people in the world,"
"proceed from their laws.""[813] For ""laws"" read ""circumstances and"
"institutions,"" adding reservations as to climate and temperament and"
"variation of _individual_ capacity and bias, and the proposition is the"
essence of all sociology. Economic lessons which Petty and Child could
not master have since been learned; but their higher wisdom has hardly
yet been assimilated.
The sufficient proof that Holland had no abnormal enlightenment even in
"commerce was that, like her rivals, she continued to maintain the system"
"of monopoly companies. Her ""empire"" in the East, to which was falsely"
"ascribed so much of her wealth, in reality stood for very little sound"
"commerce. The East India Company being conducted on high monopoly lines,"
the profits were made rather through the smallness than the greatness of
"the trade done. Thus, while the Company paid enormous dividends,[814]"
"the imports of spice were kept at a minimum, in order to maintain the"
"price, large quantities being actually destroyed for the purpose. For a"
time they contrived to raise pepper to double the old Portuguese
price.[815] Such methods brought it about that when the republic had in
"all 10,000 sail, the East India trade employed only ten or twelve"
ships.[816] All the while the small class of capitalists who owned the
shares were able to satisfy the people that the merely monetary and
factitious riches thus secured to the Company's shareholders was a form
of public wealth.[817]
"It is a complete error to say, as did Professor Seeley (_Expansion"
"of England_, p. 112), that Holland ""made her fortune in the world"""
"experienced, except such as have been already dealt with. The only class"
of case which frequently gave rise to difficulty was hæmothorax. Here
two points especially needed consideration. (1) _The source of the
"hæmorrhage as parietal or visceral._ As has been already foreshadowed,"
this was mainly to be decided by the amount and persistence of the
"hæmoptysis, but naturally free hæmoptysis did not negative concurrent"
parietal bleeding. Then the actual source of the bleeding other than
from the lung had to be considered; in the great majority of cases the
"intercostal vessels were responsible, and attention to the course of the"
tracks often allowed this to be definitely decided upon.
"A case included in the chapter on Injuries to the Blood Vessels (No. 5,"
p. 127) is of great interest in this particular; in that instance
"feebleness of the radial pulse, together with the position of the wound,"
"was a valuable indication of injury to the subclavian artery, but"
"weakened somewhat by the fact of retention of the bullet, and hence"
"uncertainty as to the exact course that it had taken, and as to whether"
the bullet itself was not responsible for pressure on the vessel. Such
"indications, however, should make one very chary of interference with a"
"hæmothorax, even with extremely urgent symptoms, in the light of our"
present knowledge of the nature of the lesions to the great vessels
"produced by small-calibre bullets, and their tendency to be incomplete."
(2) _The imminence of suppuration or its actual occurrence._--In most
"cases it sufficed to preserve an expectant attitude, and in the"
"persistence or increase of symptoms, to have recourse to an exploratory"
puncture as the best means of solution of the difficulty.
_Prognosis._--The prognosis both as to life and as to subsequent
ill-effects was remarkably good; in many cases of uncomplicated injury
to the lung the patients rejoined their regiments at the end of a month
or six weeks. In the more serious cases complicated by the collection of
"linen robes of a dazzling white, bearing the images of animal-faced gods"
"and strange symbols, as for instance a golden urn containing the sacred"
water of the Nile. The procession stopped in front of altars[75] erected
"along the road, and on these altars the sacred objects were uncovered for"
the veneration of the faithful. The strange and sumptuous magnificence of
these celebrations made a deep impression on the common people who loved
public entertainments.
But of all the celebrations connected with the worship of Isis the most
"stirring and the most suggestive {98} was the commemoration of the ""Finding"
"of Osiris"" (_Inventio_, [Greek: Heuresis]). Its antecedents date back to"
"remote antiquity. Since the time of the twelfth dynasty, and probably much"
"earlier, there had been held at Abydos and elsewhere a sacred performance"
"similar to the mysteries of our Middle Ages, in which the events of"
Osiris's passion and resurrection were reproduced. We are in possession of
"the ritual of those performances.[76] Issuing from the temple, the god fell"
"under Set's blows; around his body funeral lamentations were simulated, and"
"he was buried according to the rites; then Set was vanquished by Horus, and"
"Osiris, restored to life, reentered his temple triumphant over death."
The same myth was represented in almost the same manner at Rome at the
beginning of each November.[77] While the priests and the believers moaned
"and lamented, Isis in great distress sought the divine body of Osiris,"
"whose limbs had been scattered by Typhon. Then, after the corpse had been"
"found, rehabilitated and revived, there was a long outburst of joy, an"
exuberant jubilation that rang through the temples and the streets so
loudly that it annoyed the passers-by.
This mingled despair and enthusiasm acted as strongly upon the feelings of
"the believers as did the spring-holiday ceremony in the Phrygian religion,"
"and it acted through the same means. Moreover, there was an esoteric"
meaning attached to it that none but the pious elect understood. Besides
"type, the publisher has had a designer at work upon a cover sketch,"
and an artist upon such illustrations as the book requires. All this
has to fall in with the publisher's general scheme for the book as a
whole. The designer must know what limits are placed upon him as to
"the number of inks or foils, or the amount of gold-leaf which he may"
employ. The artist must know whether his pictures are to be drawn for
"full color, two-color or one-color plates. In deciding these questions,"
the publisher is influenced by what he believes the book to require in
"its appeal to the public, and how great an expense is warranted by the"
probability of its success.
ENGRAVING
The illustrations in all except the most pretentious volumes are either
"halftone or lineplate photo-engravings. In making a halftone plate, the"
picture or object to be reproduced is photographed through a screen
"consisting of a glass plate, diagonally ruled at right angles in two"
directions with lines numbering from fifty to four hundred to the
"inch. This screen is placed inside of the camera and in front of, and"
"very near, the chemically sensitized plate. The light reflected from"
"the object to be photographed, varying in intensity according to the"
"lights and shadows of the object, is focused on the sensitized plate"
"through the intervening line screen, and affects the sensitized film"
more or less according to its intensity. This causes a chemical change
"of such nature that the next following operations, the development"
"and the intensification of the picture, result in producing it in the"
"form of dots and stipples varying in size, and consequently in the"
"respective light and shade effects, according to the varying lights"
and shadows of the original. Inasmuch as the lights show dark and the
"darks light, the picture on the glass makes a negative of the subject."
"This negative is placed in a printing frame, in close contact with a"
"turbid fluid was effused, was found. In others a rapid suppurative"
"process, accompanied by the effusion of large quantities of plastic"
"lymph, was met with. My experience suggested that the latter condition"
"was the result of free infection from multiple wounds of the gut, the"
former the accompaniment of single wounds. Hence I should ascribe the
difference mainly to the extent of the primary infection.
This is perhaps a suitable place to further discuss the explanation of
the escape of a considerable number of the patients who received wounds
"of the abdomen, possibly implicating the bowel. Although this was not, I"
"think, so common an occurrence as has been sometimes assumed, yet many"
examples were met with. Several reasons have been advanced.
(1) Great importance has been given to the fact that many of the men
"were wounded while in a state of hunger, no food having been taken for"
twelve or more hours before the reception of the injury. In view of the
"well-proved fact in these, as in other intestinal injuries, that free"
"intestinal escape does not occur, and that it is usually a mere question"
"of infection, this explanation, in my opinion, is of small importance."
It might with far more justice be pointed out that many of these wounded
men were for them in the happy position of not having friends freely
"dosing them with brandy and water after the reception of the injury, and"
this was possibly an element of some importance.
"Some of the men did, however, drink freely, and in one case which"
terminated fatally a comrade gave a man wounded through the belly an
immediate dose of Beecham's pills.
(2) Mr. Treves has suggested that the effect of the severe trauma on the
muscular coat of the bowel is to cause a cessation of peristaltic
"movement. This, as in the case of 'local shock' elsewhere, may no doubt"
"be of importance, and to it should be added the simultaneous cessation"
fear of alarming the child. This is quite indefensible. In doing this
we are tampering with folk-lore and confusing stages of development.
"Now, I know that there are individual children that, at a tender"
"age, might be alarmed at such a story, for instance, as Little Red"
"Riding-Hood; in which case, it is better to sacrifice the “wonder"
stage” and present the story later on.
I live in dread of finding one day a bowdlerized form of “Bluebeard”
"(prepared for a junior standard), in which, to produce a satisfactory"
"finale, all the wives come to life again, and “live happily for ever"
after” with Bluebeard and each other!
And from this point it seems an easy transition to the subject of
legends of different kinds. Some of the old country legends in
"connection with flowers are very charming for children, and as long as"
"we do not tread on the sacred ground of the Nature Students, we may"
"indulge in a moderate use of such stories, of which a few will be found"
in the Story Lists.
With regard to the introduction of legends connected with saints into
"the school curriculum, my chief plea is the element of the unusual"
"which they contain, and an appeal to a sense of mysticism and wonder"
which is a wise antidote to the prosaic and commercial tendencies of
to-day. Though many of the actions of the saints may be the result of
"a morbid strain of self-sacrifice, at least none of them were engaged"
in the sole occupation of becoming rich: their ideals were often lofty
"and unselfish; their courage high, and their deeds noble. We must be"
"careful, in the choice of our legends, to show up the virile qualities"
"rather than to dwell on the elements of horror in details of martyrdom,"
"or on the too-constantly recurring miracles, lest we should defeat our"
own ends. For the children might think lightly of the dangers to which
"been maintained that Attis was not worshiped together with his companion,"
"the Great Mother, during the times of the republic, but this is undoubtedly"
"wrong, because the two persons of this divine couple must have been as"
inseparable in the ritual as they were in the myths.[10]
"But the Phrygian religion kept alive in spite of police surveillance, in"
spite of precautions and prejudices; a breach had been made in the cracked
"wall of the old Roman principles, through which the entire Orient finally"
gained ingress.
"Directly after the fall of the republic a second divinity from Asia Minor,"
"closely related to the Great Mother, became established in the capital."
During the wars against Mithridates the Roman soldiers learned to revere
"Mâ, the great goddess of the two Comanas, who was worshiped by a whole"
people of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks of
the {54} Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and
"personified fertile nature. Her worship, however, had not felt the"
"influence of Thrace, but rather that of the Semites and the Persians,[11]"
like the entire religion of Cappadocia. It is certain that she was
"identical with the Anâhita of the Mazdeans, who was of much the same"
nature.
The rites of her cult were even more sanguinary and savage than those of
"Pessinus, and she had assumed or preserved a warlike character that gave"
"her a resemblance to the Italian Bellona. The dictator Sulla, to whom this"
"invincible goddess of combats had appeared in a dream, was prompted by his"
superstition to introduce her worship into Rome. The terrible ceremonies
"connected with it produced a deep impression. Clad in black robes, her"
"""fanatics,"" as they were called, would turn round and round to the sound of"
"drums and trumpets, with their long, loose hair streaming, and when vertigo"
"seized them and a state of anesthesia was attained, they would strike their"
arms and bodies great blows with swords and axes. The view of the running
"instinctive desire to acknowledge and honor, by his noblest design and"
"work, the unseen but felt majesty of the Creator. He had a great"
"longing to enter it now, and ascended the steps with that intention;"
"but, much to his vexation, the doors were shut. He walked from the side"
to the principal entrance; that superb western frontage which is so
cruelly blocked in by a dwarfish street of the commonest shops and
"meanest houses,--and found that also closed against him. Disappointed"
"and sorry, he went back again to the side of the colossal structure,"
"and stood on the top of the steps, close to the central barred doors,"
"studying the sculptured saints in the niches, and feeling a sudden,"
"singular impression of extreme LONELINESS,--a sense of being shut out,"
"as it were, from some high festival in which he would gladly have taken"
part.
"Not a cloud was in the sky, ... the evening was one of the most"
"absolute calm, and a delicious warmth pervaded the air,--the warmth of"
"a fully declared and balmy spring. The Platz was almost deserted,--only"
"a few persons crossed it now and then, like flitting shadows,--and"
"somewhere down in one of the opposite streets a long way off, there was"
"a sound of men's voices singing a part-song. Presently, however, this"
"distant music ceased, and a deep silence followed. Alwyn still remained"
"in the sombre shade of the cathedral archway, arguing with himself"
"against the foolish and unaccountable depression that had seized him,"
and watching the brilliant May moon soar up higher and higher in the
"heavens; when,--all at once, the throbbing murmur of the great organ"
inside the Dom startled him from pensive dreaminess into swift
"attention. He listened,--the rich, round notes thundered through the"
"stillness with forceful and majestic harmony; anon, wierd tones, like"
"the passionate lament of Sarasate's ""Zigeunerweisen"" floated around and"
"above him: then, a silvery chorus of young voices broke forth in solemn"
unison:
internal sensation it is perhaps because he has another person inside
him. The case has even been recorded of a man who attributed any feeling
"he experienced, even the most normal sensations of hunger and thirst, to"
the people around him. It is exactly the same process as goes on in our
"dreams. The sane man, the normal waking man, may experience all these"
"strange sensations, but he recognises that they are the spontaneous"
outcome of his own organisation.
"We may, however, advance a step beyond this position. This"
"self-objectivation, this dramatisation of our experiences, is not"
confined to sleep and to pathological conditions which resemble sleep.
It is natural and primitive in a far wider sense. The infant will gaze
"inquisitively at its own feet, watch their movements, play with them,"
'punish' them; consciousness has not absorbed them as part of the
self.[174] The infant really acts and feels towards the remote parts of
his own body as the adult acts and feels in dreaming. We are reminded of
the generalisation of Giessler that dream consciousness corresponds to
"the normal psychic state in childhood, while sleeping subconsciousness"
corresponds to the embryonic psychic state; so that the dream state
represents the renascence of the ego disentangling itself from the
impersonal sensations and indistinct images of the embryonic stage of
life. That sleeping consciousness is the primitive embryonic consciousness
"is, indeed, indicated, it has often seemed to me, by the fact that in"
many animals the embryonic position is the position of rest and sleep.
Ducklings and chicks in the shell have their heads beneath their wing. The
"dog lies with his feet together, head flexed, and hind-quarters drawn up."
"Man, alike in the womb and asleep, tends to be curled up, with the flexors"
predominating over the extensors.
The savage has gone beyond the infant in ability to assimilate the
"impressions of his own limbs, but on the psychic side he still"
"constantly tends to objectify his own feelings and ideas, re-creating"
the superstition which made Christians akreophagous on Fridays and
fast-days and all through the forty days of Lent. When the plan of
"salting herrings was hit upon,[726] all Christian Europe helped to make"
the fortunes of the fisheries.
Net-making may have led to weaving; in any case weaving is the first
important industry developed in the Low Countries. It depended mainly on
the wool of England; and on the basis of the ancient seafaring there
"thus arose a sea-going commerce.[727] Further, the position of"
"Flanders,[728] as a trade-centre for northern and southern Europe,"
served to make it a market for all manner of produce; and round such a
market population and manufactures grew together. It belonged to the
"conditions that, though the territory came under feudal rule like every"
"other in the medieval military period, the cities were relatively"
"energetic all along,[729] theirs being (after the Dark Ages, when the"
work was largely done by the Church) the task of maintaining the
"sea-dykes[730] and water-ways, and theirs the wealth on which alone the"
feudal over-lords could hope to flourish in an unfruitful land. The
"over-lords, on their part, saw the expediency of encouraging foreigners"
"to settle and add to their taxable population,[731] thus establishing"
the tradition of political tolerance long before the Protestant period.
"Hence arose in the Netherlands, after the Renaissance, the phenomenon of"
a dense industrial population flourishing on a soil which finally could
"not be made to feed them,[732] and carrying on a vast shipping trade"
without owning a single good harbour and without possessing home-grown
"timber wherewith to build their ships, or home-products to freight"
them.[733]
One of the determinants of this growth on a partially democratic footing
was clearly the primary and peculiar necessity for combination by the
"inhabitants to maintain the great sea-dykes, the canals, and the"
embankments of the low-lying river-lands in the interior.[734] It was a
newspapers.
If I am asked how the world is to be induced to adopt these two
maxims—namely (1) that jobs should be given to people on account of
their fitness to perform them; (2) that one aim of education should be
to cure people of the habit of believing propositions for which there is
no evidence—I can only say that it must be done by generating an
enlightened public opinion. And an enlightened public opinion can only
be generated by the efforts of those who desire that it should exist. I
"do not believe that the economic changes advocated by Socialists will,"
"of themselves, do anything towards curing the evils we have been"
"considering. I think that, whatever happens in politics, the trend of"
economic development will make the preservation of mental freedom
"increasingly difficult, unless public opinion insists that the employer"
shall control nothing in the life of the employee except his work.
"Freedom in education could easily be secured, if it were desired, by"
"limiting the function of the State to inspection and payment, and"
"confining inspection rigidly to the definite instruction. But that, as"
"things stand, would leave education in the hands of the Churches,"
"because, unfortunately, they are more anxious to teach their beliefs"
"than Freethinkers are to teach their doubts. It would, however, give a"
"free field, and would make it possible for a liberal education to be"
given if it were really desired. More than that ought not to be asked of
the law.
My plea throughout this address has been for the spread of the
"scientific temper, which is an altogether different thing from the"
knowledge of scientific results. The scientific temper is capable of
regenerating mankind and providing an issue for all our troubles. The
"results of science, in the form of mechanism, poison gas, and the yellow"
"press, bid fair to lead to the total downfall of our civilization. It is"
"a curious antithesis, which a Martian might contemplate with amused"
main success.[770] Such was the standing of Dutch Protestantism in 1555;
and no edict against heresy could be more searching and merciless than
that drawn up by Charles in 1550[771] without losing any upper-class
loyalty. Philip did but strive to carry it out.[772]
"Had Philip, further, maintained a prospect of chronic war for the"
"nobility of the Netherlands, the accruing chances of wealth[773] would"
in all likelihood have sufficed to keep them loyal. In the early wars of
his reign with France immense gains had been made by them in the way of
"ransoms and booty. When these ceased, luxury continuing, embarrassment"
became general.[774] But when Philip's energies were seen to be mainly
"bent on killing out heresy, the discontented nobles began to lean to the"
side of the persecuted commonalty. At the first formation of the
"Confederacy of the ""Beggars"" in 1566, almost the only zealous Protestant"
"among the leaders was William's impetuous brother Louis of Nassau, a"
"Calvinist by training, who had for comrade the bibulous Brederode. The"
"name of ""Gueux,"" given to the malcontents in contempt by the councillor"
"Berlaimont, had direct application to the known poverty or embarrassment"
of the great majority.[775] There was thus undisguisedly at work in the
"Netherlands the great economic force which had brought about ""the"
"Reformation"" in all the Teutonic countries; and the needy nobles"
insensibly grew Protestant as it became more and more clear that only
the lands of the Church could restore their fortunes.[776] This holds
despite the fact that the more intelligent Protestantism which latterly
spread among the people was the comparatively democratic form set up by
"Calvin, which reached the Low Countries through France, finding the"
readier reception among the serious because of the prestige accruing to
its austerity as against the moral disrepute which now covered the
German forms.
"[As to the proportional success of Lutheranism and Calvinism, see"
"Motley, pp. 132, 133; and Grattan, pp. 110, 111. (On p. 110 of Grattan"
built a sanctuary for the statue of Isis sent to him from Memphis by
Ptolemy Euergetes.[14] In token of his friendship Ptolemy Soter introduced
"his god Serapis into Athens, where the latter had a temple at the foot of"
"the Acropolis[15] ever after, and Arsinoë, his mother or wife, founded"
"another at Halicarnassus, about the year 307.[16] In this manner the"
political activity of the Egyptian dynasty was directed toward having the
"divinities, whose glory was in a certain measure connected with that of"
"their house, recognized everywhere. Through Apuleius we know that under the"
empire the priests of Isis mentioned the ruling sovereign first of all in
their prayers.[17] And this was simply an imitation of the grateful
devotion which their predecessors had felt toward the Ptolemies.
"Protected by the Egyptian squadrons, sailors and merchants propagated the"
"worship of Isis, the goddess of navigators, simultaneously on the coasts of"
"Syria, {80} Asia Minor and Greece, in the islands of the Archipelago,[18]"
"and as far as the Hellespont and Thrace.[19] At Delos, where the"
"inscriptions enable us to study this worship somewhat in detail, it was not"
"merely practised by strangers, but the very sacerdotal functions were"
performed by members of the Athenian aristocracy. A number of funereal
"bas-reliefs, in which the deified dead wears the _calathos_ of Serapis on"
"his head, prove the popularity of the belief in future life propagated by"
these mysteries. According to the Egyptian faith he was identified with the
god of the dead.[20]
Even after the splendor of the court of Alexandria had faded and vanished;
even after the wars against Mithridates and the growth of piracy had ruined
"the traffic of the Ægean Sea, the Alexandrian worship was too deeply rooted"
"in the soil of Greece to perish, although it became endangered in certain"
"seaports like Delos. Of all the gods of the Orient, Isis and Serapis were"
the only ones that retained a place among the great divinities of the
Hellenic world until the end of paganism.[21]
"be regarded as abnormal, they occur in persons who are perfectly healthy"
and sane.
"It will be seen that a synaesthesia--which may involve taste, smell,"
and other senses besides hearing and sight--causes an impression of one
sensory order to be automatically and involuntarily linked on to an
"impression of another totally different order. In other words, we may say"
"that the one impression becomes the _symbol_ of the other impression, for"
a symbol--which is literally a throwing together--means that two things
of different orders have become so associated that one of them may be
regarded as the sign and representative of the other.
"There is, however, another still more natural and fundamental form of"
"symbolism which is entirely normal, and almost, indeed, physiological."
This is the tendency by which qualities of one order become symbols of
"qualities of a totally different order, because they instinctively seem"
"to have a similar effect on us. In this way, things in the physical"
order become symbols of things in the spiritual order. This symbolism
penetrates indeed the whole of language; we cannot escape from it. The
"sea is _deep_, and so also may thoughts be; ice is _cold_, and we say"
"the same of some hearts; sugar is _sweet_, as the lover finds also the"
"presence of the beloved; quinine is _bitter_, and so is remorse. Not only"
"our adjectives, but our substantives and our verbs are equally symbolical."
"To the etymological eye every sentence is full of metaphor, of symbol,"
"of images that, strictly and originally, express sensory impressions of"
"one order, but, as we use them to-day, express impressions of a totally"
different order. Language is largely the utilisation of symbols. This is a
well-recognised fact which it is unnecessary to elaborate.[131]
"An interesting example of the natural tendency to symbolism, which may"
"be compared to the allied tendency in dreaming, is furnished by another"
"language, the language of music. Music is a representation of the"
"and the tithes being parcelled among the landowners, the king, and the"
"clergy. Naturally a large part of the lands, as before, was divided"
"among the nobles,[680] who were in this way converted to Protestantism."
Thus whereas heathen kings had originally embraced Christianity to
"enable them to consolidate their power, Christian kings embraced"
Protestantism to enable them to recover wealth and power from the
Catholic Church. Creed all along followed interest;[681] and the people
had small concern in the change.[682]
"Norway, being under the same crown, followed the course of Denmark. In"
Sweden the powerful Gustavus Vasa saw himself forced at the outset of
his reign to take power and wealth from the Church if he would have any
"of his own; and after the dramatic scene in the Diet of Westeras (1527),"
in which he broke out with a passionate vow to renounce the crown if he
"were not better supported,[683] he carried his point. The nobles, being"
"""squared""[684] by permission to resume such of their ancestral lands as"
"had been given to churches and convents since 1454, and by promise of"
"further grants, forced the bishops to consent to surrender to the king"
"their castles and strongholds, and to let him fix their revenues; all"
which was duly done. The monasteries were soon despoiled of nearly all
"their lands, many of which were seized by or granted in fief to the"
barons;[685] and the king became head of the Church in as full a degree
"as Henry VIII in England;[686] sagaciously, and in part unscrupulously,"
creating for the first time in Scandinavia a strong yet not wholly
"despotic monarchy, with such revenues from many sources[687] as made"
"possible the military power and activity of Gustavus Adolphus, and"
"later the effort of Charles XII to create an ""empire""--an effort which,"
"necessarily failing, reduced Sweden permanently to her true economic"
basis.
"Apart from those remarkable episodes, the development of the"
"Scandinavian States since the sixteenth century has been, on their"
"concerning dreams of flying, he comes to the conclusion that 'the"
sensation of aerial flight in dreams is simply a hallucinatory phenomenon
"of an exclusively physiological [he means 'psychological'] kind,' and"
"not evidence of the existence of the 'astral body.'[106] The fact,"
"nevertheless, that so many people are found who believe such dreams to"
"possess some kind of reality, clearly indicates the powerful impression"
they make.
"All my life, it seems to me, certainly from an early age, until recently,"
I have at intervals had dreams in which I imagined myself rhythmically
"bounding into the air, and supported on the air, remaining there for"
a perceptible interval; at other times I have felt myself gliding
"downstairs, but not supported by the stairs. In my case the experience"
"is nearly always agreeable, involving a certain sense of power, and it"
"usually evokes no marked surprise, occurring as a familiar and accustomed"
"pleasure. On awaking I do not usually remember these dreams immediately,"
which seems to indicate that they are not due to causes specially
"operative at the end of sleep, or liable to bring sleep to a conclusion."
But they leave behind them a vague yet profound sense of belief in their
reality and reasonableness.
"Dream-flight, it is necessary to note, is not usually the sustained flight"
"of a bird or an insect, and the dreamer rarely or never imagines that he"
is borne high into the air. Hutchinson states that of all those whom he
has asked about the matter 'hardly one has ever known himself to make any
"high flights in his dreams. One almost always flies low, with a skimming"
"manner, slightly, but only slightly, above the heads of pedestrians.'[107]"
"Beaunis, from his own experience, describes what I should consider a"
"typical kind of dream-flight as a series of light bounds, at one or two"
"yards above the earth, each bound clearing from ten to twenty yards,"
"the dream being accompanied by a delicious sensation of easy movement,"
"case of injury to the small intestine, No. 166, on which I operated,"
there was absolutely no gross escape until the bowel was removed from
"the abdominal cavity, when the contents spurted out freely. In one case"
of very oblique injury to the colon there was a considerable quantity of
"fæcal matter in a localised space, but as a rule the ordinary condition"
best described as 'peritoneal infection' from the wound was found. The
bad effect of anything like free escape was well shown in multiple
perforations; in these suppurative peritonitis rapidly developed and the
patients died at the end of thirty-six hours or less. A typical case is
quoted in No. 168.
"2. _Peritoneal infection, and general septicæmia._--As is evident from"
"the results quoted among the cases, the degree which this reached varied"
greatly. It may of course be assumed that in some measure it occurred in
"every case in which the bowel was perforated, but it was sometimes so"
slight as to be scarcely noticeable. This may be said to have been most
"common in injuries to the large intestine. Wounds of the cæcum,"
"ascending and descending colon, the sigmoid flexure, or the rectum, were"
"sometimes followed by no serious symptoms, either local or general."
"Again in these portions of the bowel the development of local signs, and"
"the later formation of an abscess, were by no means uncommon."
"In the case of the small intestine I never observed this sequence, and"
"the same may be said of the transverse colon, which in its anatomical"
arrangement and position so nearly approximates to the small bowel. In
suspected wounds of these portions of the bowel either the symptoms were
"so slight as to render it doubtful whether a perforation had occurred,"
"or marked signs of general peritoneal septicæmia developed, and death"
resulted.
The condition of the peritoneum in fatal cases varied much. In some a
"dry peritonitis, or one in which a considerable quantity of slightly"
receive them.
We are all acquainted with this talk in speculative regions of
"knowledge, but we most of us also know how disastrous it is to any true"
advancement in such directions. What happens now is just what happened
in the eighteenth century. Men relapse into a self-satisfied indolence
of mind: in religion they are content with believing in a sort of
"general divine Beneficence which will somehow make matters straight,"
however crooked they may seem to be; and in philosophy they are guided
"by their instincts, which teach them that what they wish to believe is"
true.
"Now, all this is what Ferrier and the modern movement, largely"
"influenced by German modes of thought, wish to protest against with all"
"their might. The scepticism of Hume and Gibbon was logical, if utterly"
impossible as a working creed and necessarily ending in absurdity; but
this irrational kind of optimism was altogether repugnant to those who
demanded a reasonable explanation of themselves and of their place in
nature. The question had become summed up in one of superlative
"importance, namely, the distinction that existed between the natural"
and supernatural sides of our existence. The materialistic school had
"practically done away with the latter in its entirety, had said that"
"nature is capable of being explained by mechanical means, and that"
these must necessarily suffice for us. But the orthodox section adopted
"other lines; it accepted all the ordinarily received ideas of God,"
"immortality, and the like, but it maintained the existence of an"
"Absolute which can only be inferred, but not presented to the mind,"
"and, strangest of all, declared that the 'last and highest consecration"
"of all true religion must be an altar ""To the unknown and unknowable"
"God.""'[6] This so-called 'pious' philosophy declares that 'To think"
"that God is, as we can think Him to be, is blasphemy,' and 'A God"
understood would be no God at all.' The German philosophy saw that if
"hard, frenzied efforts to kill, and above all a spirit, fanatical, that"
"urged each man to bear more, kill more, because he was a Crusader for"
the right.
"Into this red crucible I had plunged, and now emerged--remolded. In one"
"brief year and a half I had lived my life, dreamed the undreamable,"
"accomplished the unaccomplishable. Much had gone from me, yet much had"
come--and it was this which had come that distorted my vision of future
"days; making them drab, making my fellows who had not taken the plunge"
"seem purposeless and immature. Either they were out of tune, or I"
"was--and I thought, of course, that they were. What freshness could I"
bring to an existence of peace when my gears would not mesh with its
humdrum machinery!
"My mother, ever quick to detect the workings of my mind as well as the"
"variations of my body, had noticed these changes when I disembarked the"
"previous week, and had become obsessed with the idea that I stood"
"tottering on the brink of abysmal wretchedness. So, while I was marking"
"time the few days at camp until the hour of demobilization, she summoned"
"into hasty conference my father, our family doctor, and the select near"
"relatives whose advice was a matter of habit rather than value, to"
devise means of leading me out of myself.
"This, I afterward learned, had been a weighty conference, resulting in"
the conclusion that I must have complete rest and diversion. But as my
more recent letters home had expressed a determination to rush headlong
"into business--as a sort of fatuous panacea for jumpy nerves, no"
doubt--and since the conferees possessed an intimate knowledge of the
"mulish streak that coursed through my blood, their plans were laid"
"behind my back with the greatest secrecy. Therefore, when entering the"
"library this last night in December and hurrying to my mother's arms, I"
"had no suspicion that I was being drawn into a very agreeable trap,"
[Sidenote: The Chapel of the Great Relic.]
"At last one of the priests, attended by an acolyte, took up a censer,"
"placed a little incense on the coals with a teaspoon, and, swinging it"
"in his hand by the chain, led us back into the cathedral, turned to"
"a chapel on the left, unlocked an iron gate in a tall railing which"
"separated this chapel from the body of the building, closed the gate"
"again when our party had come inside, and, while a dozen or so of"
the people who had been at their devotions crowded up to the railing
"and peered curiously through, he and his attendant began to kneel"
repeatedly before the altar and to swing the smoking censer on every
"side. Above the altar was a strong, square steel box, over which, in"
"plain view, was suspended a _fac-simile_ of the Iron Crown, made of"
"cheaper materials, while the real crown was still concealed within the"
steel safe.
[Sidenote: The Great Relic itself.]
"Handing the censer to his attendant, that it might be kept swinging"
"without intermission, the priest produced another series of keys and"
proceeded to unlock a succession of small doors in the side of the
"metal safe, which proved to be a ""nest"" of caskets, one within another,"
"the last of which was a glass case. Drawing this out, he brought into"
"full view the venerated crown of the Lombard kings, and told us to step"
up on the stool by the altar so as to see it better. It is made of six
"plates of gold, joined end to end, richly chased, and set with splendid"
"jewels. But one would see at a glance that neither the material, nor"
"the workmanship, nor the gems, could account for the unique reverence"
"with which it has been regarded for centuries, and an indication of"
which we had just seen in the service conducted by the priest. Among
"the regalia in the Tower of London, and at several other places in"
"continuance of the severer medieval destructive checks. They must,"
"therefore, have put a high degree of restraint on marriage, and probably"
observed parental prudence in addition.
"When it is found that in Sweden, where the conditions and usages were"
"once similar, there was latterly at once less prudential restraint on"
"marriage and population, and a lower standard of material well-being,"
the two cases are seen to furnish a kind of _experimentum crucis_. The
comparatively late maintenance of a powerful military system in Sweden
having there prolonged the methods of aristocratic and bureaucratic
"control while they were being modified in Denmark-Norway, Swedish"
population in the eighteenth century was subject to artificial stimulus.
"From about the year 1748, the Government set itself, on the ordinary"
"empirical principle of militarism, to encourage population.[700] Among"
its measures were the variously wise ones of establishing medical
"colleges and lying-in and foundling hospitals, the absolute freeing of"
"the internal trade in grain, and the withdrawal in 1748 of an old law"
limiting the number of persons allowed to each farm. The purpose of that
law had been to stimulate population by spreading tillage; but the spare
"soil being too unattractive, the young people emigrated. On the law"
"being abolished, population did increase considerably, rising between"
"1751 and 1800 from 1,785,727 to 2,347,308,[701] though some severe"
"famines had occurred within the period. But in the year 1799, when"
"Malthus visited the country, the increased population suffered from"
"famine very severely indeed, living mainly and miserably on bark"
bread.[702] It was one of Malthus's great object-lessons in his science.
On one side a poor country was artificially over-populated; on the
"other, the people of Norway, an even poorer country, directly and"
"indirectly[703] restrained their rate of increase, while the Government"
during a long period wrought to the same end by the adjustment of its
military system and by making a certificate of earning power or income
"necessary for all marriages.[704] The result was that, save in the"
"The Genevan philosopher had asserted that Christianity, by enthroning"
"in the hearts of Christians the idea of a Kingdom not of this world,"
"broke the unity of civil society, because it detached the hearts of"
"its converts from the State, as from all earthly things. To this the"
Genevan minister had successfully replied by quoting Christian
teachings on the subject at issue. But Buonaparte fiercely accuses
"the pastor of neither having understood, nor even read, ""Le Contrat"
"Social"": he hurls at his opponent texts of Scripture which enjoin"
obedience to the laws: he accuses Christianity of rendering men slaves
"to an anti-social tyranny, because its priests set up an authority in"
"opposition to civil laws; and as for Protestantism, it propagated"
"discords between its followers, and thereby violated civic unity."
"Christianity, he argues, is a foe to civil government, for it aims at"
making men happy in this life by inspiring them with hope of a future
"life; while the aim of civil government is ""to lend assistance to the"
"feeble against the strong, and by this means to allow everyone to"
"enjoy a sweet tranquillity, the road of happiness."" He therefore"
concludes that Christianity and civil government are diametrically
opposed.
In this tirade we see the youth's spirit of revolt flinging him not
"only against French law, but against the religion which sanctions it."
He sees none of the beauty of the Gospels which Rousseau had
admitted. His views are more rigid than those of his teacher.
"Scarcely can he conceive of two influences, the spiritual and the"
"governmental, working on parallel lines, on different parts of man's"
"nature. His conception of human society is that of an indivisible,"
"indistinguishable whole, wherein materialism, tinged now and again by"
"religious sentiment and personal honour, is the sole noteworthy"
influence. He finds no worth in a religion which seeks to work from
"within to without, which aims at transforming character, and thus"
transforming the world. In its headlong quest of tangible results his
delight in doubt or surrender to it; the masses wanted certainties. There
was nothing to revive confidence in the power of a decrepit and threadbare
science. No great discovery transformed the conception of the universe.
"Nature no longer betrayed her secrets, the earth remained unexplored and"
the past inscrutable. Every branch of knowledge was forgotten. The world
"cursed with sterility, could but repeat itself; it had the poignant"
"appreciation of its own decay and impotence. Tired of fruitless researches,"
the mind surrendered to the necessity of believing. Since the intellect was
"unable to formulate a consistent rule of life faith alone could supply it,"
"and the multitudes gravitated toward the temples, where the truths taught"
to man in earlier days by the Oriental gods were revealed. The stanch
adherence of past generations to beliefs and rites of unlimited antiquity
seemed to guarantee their truth and efficacy. This current was so strong
that philosophy itself was swept toward mysticism and the neo-Platonist
school became a theurgy.
"The Oriental mysteries, then, could stir the soul by arousing admiration"
"and terror, pity and enthusiasm in turn. They gave the intellect the"
illusion of learned depth and absolute certainty and finally--our third
{35} point--they satisfied conscience as well as passion and reason. Among
"the complex causes that guaranteed their domination, this was without doubt"
the most effective.
"In every period of their history the Romans, unlike the Greeks in this"
"respect, judged theories and institutions especially by their practical"
results. They always had a soldier's and business man's contempt for
metaphysicians. It is a matter of frequent observation that the philosophy
of the Latin world neglected metaphysical speculations and concentrated its
"attention on morals, just as later the Roman church left to the subtle"
Hellenes the interminable controversies over the essence of the divine
logos and the double nature of Christ. Questions that could rouse and
"divide her were those having a direct application to life, like the"
"Before quitting the subject of the relics at Rome, I must give my"
"readers what Hare calls ""the extraordinary history of the manufacture"
"of S. Filomena, now one of the most popular saints in Italy, and one"
towards whom idolatry is carried out with frantic enthusiasm both at
"Domo d'Ossola and in some of the Neapolitan States."""
"""In the year 1802, while some excavations were going forward in the"
"Catacombs of Priscilla, a sepulchre was discovered containing the"
skeleton of a young female; on the exterior were rudely painted some
of the symbols constantly recurring in these chambers of the dead--an
"anchor, an olive branch (emblems of Hope and Peace), a scourge, two"
"arrows, and a javelin; above them the following inscription, of which"
the beginning and end were destroyed:
"--""LUMENA PAX TE CUM FI""--"
"The remains, reasonably supposed to be those of one of the early"
"martyrs for the faith, were sealed up and deposited in the treasury"
of relics in the Lateran; here they remained for some years unthought
"of. On the return of Pius VII. from France, a Neapolitan prelate was"
"sent to congratulate him. One of the priests in his train, who wished"
"to create a sensation in his district, where the long residence of the"
"French had probably caused some decay of piety, begged for a few relics"
"to carry home, and these recently discovered remains were bestowed on"
him; the inscription was translated somewhat freely to signify _Santa
"Philomena, rest in peace_. Another priest, whose name is suppressed,"
"_because of his great humility_, was favored by a vision in the broad"
"noonday, in which he beheld the glorious virgin Filomena, who was"
pleased to reveal to him that she had suffered death for preferring
the Christian faith and her vow of chastity to the addresses of the
"emperor, who wished to make her his wife. This vision leaving much"
"of her history obscure, a certain young artist, whose name is also"
thought and culture of Europe during a hundred years in which Europe was
being reborn; and in our own day some of the greatest imaginative
"literature of the modern world comes from Norway, long the most backward"
"of the group. Ibsen, one of a notable company of masters, stood at the"
head of the drama of the nineteenth century; and the society which
"sustained him, however he may have satirised it, is certificated abreast"
of its age.
§ 5
In one aspect the Scandinavian polities have a special lesson for the
"larger nations. They have perforce been specially exercised latterly, as"
"of old, by the problem of population; and in Norway there was formerly"
"made one of the notable, if not one of the best, approaches to a"
practical solution of it. Malthus long ago[698] noted the Norwegian
marriage-rate as the lowest in Europe save that of Switzerland; and he
"expressed the belief that in his day Norway was ""almost the only country"
in Europe where a traveller will hear any apprehension expressed of a
"redundant population, and where the danger to the happiness of the lower"
"classes of people is in some degree seen and understood.""[699] This"
"state of things having long subsisted, there is a presumption that it"
"persists uninterruptedly from pagan times, when, as we have seen, there"
existed a deliberate population-policy; for Christian habits of mind can
"nowhere be seen to have set up such a tendency, and it would be hard to"
show in the history of Norway any great political change which might
"effect a rapid revolution in the domestic habits of the peasantry, such"
"as occurred in France after the Revolution. Broadly speaking, the mass"
of the Norwegian people had till the last century continued to live
under those external or domiciliary restraints on multiplication which
"were normal in rural Europe in the Middle Ages, and which elsewhere have"
been removed by industrialism; yet without suffering latterly from a
"dictatorship, were to be borne, provided that social equality could be"
saved. As republican Rome had saved her early liberties by intrusting
"unlimited powers to a temporary dictator, so, claimed Rousseau, a"
young commonwealth must by a similar device consult Nature's first law
of self-preservation. The dictator saves liberty by temporarily
abrogating it: by momentary gagging of the legislative power he
renders it truly vocal.
The events of the French Revolution form a tragic commentary on these
theories. In the first stage of that great movement we see the
"followers of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau marching in an"
undivided host against the ramparts of privilege. The walls of the
Bastille fall down even at the blast of their trumpets. Odious feudal
privileges disappear in a single sitting of the National Assembly; and
"the _Parlements_, or supreme law courts of the provinces, are swept"
"away. The old provinces themselves are abolished, and at the beginning"
of 1790 France gains social and political unity by her new system of
"Departments, which grants full freedom of action in local affairs,"
though in all national concerns it binds France closely to the new
popular government at Paris. But discords soon begin to divide the
reformers: hatred of clerical privilege and the desire to fill the
empty coffers of the State dictate the first acts of spoliation.
Tithes are abolished: the lands of the Church are confiscated to the
service of the State; monastic orders are suppressed; and the
Government undertakes to pay the stipends of bishops and priests.
"Furthermore, their subjection to the State is definitely secured by"
"the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July, 1790) which invalidates"
their allegiance to the Pope. Most of the clergy refuse: these are
"termed non-jurors or orthodox priests, while their more complaisant"
colleagues are known as constitutional priests. Hence arises a serious
"schism in the Church, which distracts the religious life of the land,"
and separates the friends of liberty from the champions of the
"say, that the usually coherent elements of our mental life are split up,"
"and some of them--often, it is curious to note, precisely those which are"
at that very moment the most prominent and poignant--are reconstituted
"into what seems to us an outside and objective world, of which we are the"
"interested or the merely curious spectators, but in neither case realise"
that we are ourselves the origin of.
"An elementary source of this tendency to objectivation is to be found,"
"it may be noted, in the automatic impulse towards symbolism by which all"
sorts of feelings experienced by the dreamer become transformed into
"concrete visible images. When objectivation is thus attained, dissociation"
may be said to be secondary. So far indeed as I am able to dissect the
"dream-process, the tendency to symbolism seems nearly always to precede"
"the dissociation in consciousness, though it may well be that the"
dissociation of the mental elements is a necessary subconscious condition
for the symbolism.
Sensory symbolism rests on a very fundamental psychic tendency. On the
"abnormal side we find it in the synaesthesias which, since Galton first"
"drew attention to them in 1883, in his _Inquiries into Human Faculty_,"
"have become well known, and are found among between six to over twelve per"
cent. of people. Galton investigated chiefly those kinds of synaesthesias
which he called 'number-forms' and 'colour associations.' The number-form
is characteristic of those people who almost invariably think of
"numerals in some more or less constant form of visual imagery, the"
number instantaneously calling up the picture. In persons who experience
"colour-associations, or coloured-hearing, there is a similar instantaneous"
"manifestation of particular colours in connection with particular sounds,"
"the different vowel sounds, for instance, each constantly and persistently"
"evolving a definite tint, as _a_ white, _e_ vermilion, _i_ yellow,"
"etc., no two persons, however, having exactly the same colour scheme of"
"sounds.[130] These phenomena are not so very rare, and, though they must"
"commerce, which finally undermined it, were set up or stimulated by its"
"own example. With less rapacity, indeed, it might have conciliated"
populations that it alienated. A lack of any higher ideals than those of
zealous commerce marks its entire career; it is associated with no such
growth of learning and the fine arts as took place in commercial
Holland; and its members seem to have been among the most unrefined of
the northern city populations.[724] But it made for progress on the
"ordinary levels. In a world wholly bent on privilege in all directions,"
it at least tempered its own spirit of monopoly in some measure by its
principle of inclusion; and it passed away as a great power before it
could dream of renewing the ideal of monopoly in the more sinister form
"of Oriental empire taken up by the Dutch. And, while its historians have"
not been careful to make a comparative study of the internal civic life
"which flourished under the commercial union, it does not at all appear"
"that the divisions of classes were more steep, or the lot of the lower"
"worse, than in any northern European State of the period."
"The ""downfall"" of such a polity, then, is conceptual only. All the"
realities of life evolved by the league were passed on to its
constituent elements throughout northern Europe; and there survived from
it what the separate States had not yet been able to offer--the
"adumbration, however dim, of a union reaching beyond the bounds of"
"nationality and the jealousies of race. In an age of private war,"
"without transcending the normal ethic, it practically limited private"
war as regarded its German members; and while joining battle at need
"with half-barbarian northern kings, or grudging foreigners, it of"
"necessity made peace its ideal. Its dissolution, therefore, marked at"
"once the advance of national organisation up to its level, and the"
persistence of the more primitive over the more rational instincts of
coalition.
FOOTNOTES:
"advanced and elevated human civilization, even this merit appears very"
"doubtful in presence of the facts of history, and at least as very"
"rarely or isolatedly the case. In general, however, it cannot be denied"
that most systems of religion have proved rather inimical than friendly
"to civilization. For religion, as already stated, tolerates no doubt, no"
"discussion, no contradiction, no investigations, those eternal pioneers"
of the future of science and intellect! Even the simple circumstance
that our present state of culture has already long since left far
behind it all and even the highest intellectual ideals established and
elaborated by former religions may show how little intellectual progress
is influenced by religion. Mankind is perpetually being thrown to and
"fro between science, and religion, but it advances moro intellectually,"
morally and physically in proportion as it turns away from religion and
to science.
"* ""In China, where people are, as is well-known, very"
"indifferent or tolerant in religious matters, this fine"
"proverb is current: Religions are various, but reason is"
"one, and we are all brothers.'"""
"""It is therefore clear that for our present age and for the future a"
"foundation must be sought and found for culture and morality, different"
from that which can be furnished to us by religion. It is not the fear
"of God that acts amelioratingly or ennoblingly upon manners, of which"
the middle ages furnish us with a striking proof; but the ennobling of
the conception of the world in general which goes hand in hand with
the advance of civilization. Let us then give up making a show of the
"profession of hypocritical words of faith, the only purpose of which"
seems to be that they may be continually shown to be lies by the actions
and deeds of their professors! The man of the future will feel far more
happy and contented when he has not to contend at every step of his
intellectual forward development with those tormenting contradictions
nature of an excitation is rightly perceived its quality cannot be
rightly perceived. The dreamer may be able to perceive that he is being
"bitten, but the massive and profound impression of a bite which reaches"
his dreaming consciousness would not be adequately accounted for by
the supposition of the real mosquito that is the cause of it; the only
adequate explanation of the transformed impression received is to be found
(as in a dream already narrated) in a creature as large as a lobster.
This creature is the symbol of the real mosquito.[148] We have the same
phenomenon under somewhat similar conditions in the intoxication of
chloroform and nitrous oxide.
"The obscuration during sleep of the external sensory channels, with"
"the checks on false conclusions they furnish, is not alone sufficient"
to explain the symbolism of dreams. The dissociation of thought during
"sleep, with the diminished attention and apperception involved, is also"
a factor. The magnification of special isolated sensory impressions in
"dreaming consciousness is associated with a general bluntness, even an"
"absolute quiescence, of the external sensory mechanism. One part of the"
"organism, and it seems usually a visceral part, is thus apt to magnify its"
place in consciousness at the expense of the rest. As Vaschide and Piéron
"say, during sleep 'the internal sensations develop at the expense of the"
peripheral sensations.' That indeed seems to be the secret of the immense
emotional turmoil of our dreams. Yet it is very rare for these internal
sensations to reach the sleeping brain as what they are. They become
"conscious, not as literal messages, but as symbolical transformations."
"The excited or labouring heart recalls to the brain no memory of itself,"
"but some symbolical image of excitement or labour. There is association,"
"indeed, but it is association not along the matter-of-fact lines of our"
"ordinary waking civilised life, but along much more fundamental and"
"primitive channels, which in waking life we have now abandoned or never"
knew.
"their deceased god and later, after he had revived, celebrated with"
exultation his birth to a new life. Or else they joined in the passion of
"Mithra, condemned to create the world in suffering. This common grief and"
"joy were often expressed with savage violence, by bloody mutilations, long"
"wails of despair, and extravagant acclamations. The manifestations of the"
extreme fanaticism of those barbarian races that had not been touched by
Greek skepticism and the very ardor of their faith inflamed the souls of
the multitudes attracted by the exotic gods.
The Oriental religions touched every chord of sensibility and satisfied the
thirst for religious emotion that the austere Roman creed had been unable
to quench. {31} But at the same time they satisfied the intellect more
"fully, and this is my second point."
In very early times Greece--later imitated by Rome--became resolutely
rationalistic: her greatest originality lies here. Her philosophy was
purely laical; thought was unrestrained by any sacred tradition; it even
pretended to pass judgment upon these traditions and condemned or approved
"of them. Being sometimes hostile, sometimes indifferent and some times"
"conciliatory, it always remained independent of faith. But while Greece"
"thus freed herself from the fetters of a superannuated mythology, and"
openly and boldly constructed those systems of metaphysics by means of
"which she claimed to solve the enigmas of the universe, her religion lost"
its vitality and dried up because it lacked the strengthening nourishment
"of reflection. It became a thing devoid of sense, whose _raison d'être_ was"
no longer understood; it embodied dead ideas and an obsolete conception of
the world. In Greece as well as at Rome it was reduced to a collection of
"unintelligible rites, scrupulously and mechanically reproduced without"
addition or omission because they had been practised by the ancestors of
"long ago, and formulas hallowed by the _mos maiorum_, that were no longer"
understood or sincerely cherished. Never did a people of advanced culture
have a more infantile religion.
"cities, especially at Amphipolis in Macedonia, graves have been found"
adorned with earthenware statuettes representing the shepherd Attis;[22]
and even in Germany the gravestones are frequently decorated with the
"figure of a young man in Oriental costume, leaning dejectedly upon a"
"knotted stick (_pedum_), who represented the same Attis. We are ignorant of"
the conception of immortality held by the Oriental disciples of the
"Phrygian priests. Maybe, like the votaries of Sabazius, they believed that"
the blessed ones were permitted to participate with Hermes Psychopompos in
"a great celestial feast, for which they were prepared by the sacred repasts"
of the mysteries.[23] {60}
"Another agent in favor of this imported religion was, as we have stated"
"above, the fact of its official recognition. This placed it in a privileged"
"position among Oriental religions, at least at the beginning of the"
imperial régime. It enjoyed a toleration that was neither precarious nor
limited; it was not subjected to arbitrary police measures nor to coercion
on the part of magistrates; its fraternities were not continually
"threatened with dissolution, nor its priests with expulsion. It was"
"publicly authorized and endowed, its holidays were marked in the calendars"
"of the pontiffs, its associations of dendrophori were organs of municipal"
"life in Italy and in the provinces, and had a corporate entity."
"Therefore it is not surprising that other foreign religions, after being"
"transferred to Rome, sought to avert the dangers of an illicit existence by"
an alliance with the Great Mother. The religion of the latter frequently
"consented to agreements and compromises, from which it gained in reality as"
much as it gave up. In exchange for material advantages it acquired
complete moral authority over the gods that accepted its protection. Thus
Cybele and Attis absorbed a majority of the divinities from Asia Minor that
had crossed the Ionian Sea. Their clergy undoubtedly intended to establish
a religion complex enough to enable the emigrants from every part of the
"vast peninsula, slaves, merchants, soldiers, functionaries, scholars, in"
"merchants, and so ruined his credit,[790] the Dutch issued tin money and"
"paper money, and found it readily pass current with friends and"
foes.[791]
"Of all the Protestant countries, excepting Switzerland, the Dutch States"
alone disposed of their confiscated church lands in the public
"interest.[792] There was indeed comparatively little to sell,[793] and"
the money was sorely needed to carry on the war; but the transaction
seems to have been carried through without any corruption. It was the
suggestion of what might be accomplished in statecraft by the new
"_expertise_ of trade, forced into the paths of public spirit and checked"
by a stress of public opinion such as had never come into play in
"Venice. Against such a power as Spain, energy ruled by unteachable"
"unintelligence, a world-empire financed by the expedients of provincial"
"feudalism, the Dutch needed only an enduring resentment to sustain them,"
and this Philip amply elicited. Had he spent on light cruisers for the
destruction of Dutch commerce the treasure he wasted on the Armadas
"against England and on his enormous operations by land, typified in the"
"monstrous siege of Antwerp, he might have struck swiftly and surely at"
the very arteries of Dutch life; but in yielding to them the command of
"their primary source and channel of wealth, the sea, he insured their"
ultimate success. In the Franco-Spanish war of 1521-25 the French
cruisers nearly ruined the herring fishery of Holland and Zealand;[794]
and it was doubtless the memory of that plight that set the States on
maintaining predominant power at sea.[795]
"Throughout the war, which from first to last spread over eighty years,"
"the Dutch commerce grew while that of Spain dwindled. Under Charles V,"
Flanders and Brabant alone had paid nearly two-thirds of the whole
imperial taxation of the Netherlands;[796] but after a generation or
two the United Provinces must have been on an equality of financial
"resources with those left under Spanish rule, even in a state of peace."
"fishing districts, where speculative conditions encouraged early"
"marriages and large families, the Norwegian population were better off"
than the Swedish.[705]
"Already in Malthus' youth the Norwegian-Danish policy had been altered,"
all legal and military restrictions on marriage having been withdrawn;
and he notes that fears were expressed as to the probable results. It is
one of his shortcomings to have entirely abstained from subsequent
investigation of the subject; and in his late addendum as to the state
of Sweden in 1826 he further fails to note that as a result of a
"creation there after 1803 of 6,000 new farms from land formerly waste,"
the country ceased to need to import corn and was able to export a
"surplus.[706] It still held good, however, that the Norwegian"
"population, being from persistence of prudential habit[707] much the"
"slower in its rate of increase, had the higher standard of comfort,"
despite much spread of education in Sweden.
Within the past half-century the general development of commerce and of
industry has tended broadly to equalise the condition of the
Scandinavian peoples. As late as 1835 a scarcity would suffice to drive
"the Norwegian peasantry to the old subsistence of bark bread, a ruinous"
"resort, seeing that it destroyed multitudes of trees of which the value,"
"could the timber have found a market, would have far exceeded that of a"
quantity of flour yielding much more and better food. At that period the
British market was closed by duties imposed in the interest of the
Canadian timber trade.[708] Since the establishment of British free
"trade, Norwegian timber has become a new source of wealth; and through"
this and other and earlier commercial developments prudential family
"habits were affected. Thus, whereas the population of Sweden had all but"
"doubled between 1800 and 1880, the population of Norway had grown even"
faster.[709] And whereas in 1834 the proportion of illegitimate to
legitimate births in Stockholm was 1 to 2.26[710] (one of the results of
"says an Egyptian text, ""he also shall live; as truly as Osiris is not dead,"
"shall he not die; as truly as Osiris is not annihilated, shall he not be"
"annihilated.""[81]"
"If, then, the deceased had piously served Osiris-Serapis, he was"
"assimilated to that god, and shared his immortality in the underworld,"
where the judge of the dead held forth. He lived not as a tenuous shade or
"as a subtle spirit, but in full possession of his body as well as of his"
"soul. That was the Egyptian doctrine, and that certainly was also the"
doctrine of the Greco-Latin mysteries.[82]
"Through the initiation the mystic was born again, but to a superhuman life,"
and became the equal of the immortals.[83] In his ecstasy he imagined that
he was crossing the threshold of death and contemplating the gods of heaven
and hell face to face.[84] If he had accurately followed the prescriptions
"imposed upon him by Isis and Serapis through their priests, those gods"
prolonged his life after his decease beyond the duration assigned to it by
"destiny, and he participated eternally in their beatitude and offered them"
"his homage in their realm.[85] The ""unspeakable pleasure"" he felt when"
contemplating the sacred images in the temple[86] became perpetual rapture
"when he was in the divine presence instead of in the presence of the image,"
and drawn close to divinity his thirsting soul enjoyed the delights of that
ineffable beauty.[87]
"When the Alexandrian mysteries spread over Italy under the republic, no"
religion had ever brought to mankind so formal a promise of blest
"immortality as these, and this, more than anything else, lent them an {101}"
irresistible power of attraction. Instead of the vague and contradictory
"opinions of the philosophers in regard to the destiny of the soul, Serapis"
offered certainty founded on divine revelation corroborated by the faith of
the countless generations that had adhered to it. What the votaries of
"Orpheus had confusedly discovered through the veil of the legends, and"
"between knowledge and faith which plague his youth, and occupy his"
mature age unnecessarily with the slow renunciation of the notions which
"he imbibed in his youth. What we sacrifice to God, we take away from"
"mankind, and absorb a great part of his best intellectual powers in"
"the pursuit of an unattainable goal. At any rate, the least that we can"
expect in this respect from the state and society of the future is a
"complete separation between ecclesiastical and worldly affairs, or"
an absolute emancipation of the state and the school from every
ecclesiastical influence.
"""Education must be founded upon _knowledge_, not upon _faith_; and"
religion itself should be taught in the public schools only as religious
history and as an objective or scientific exposition of the different
"religious systems prevailing among mankind. Any one who, after such an"
"education, still experiences the need of a definite law or rule of faith"
"may then attach himself to any religious sect that may seem good to him,"
but cannot claim that the community should bear the cost of this special
fancy!
"""As regards Christianity, or the _Paulinism_ which is falsely called"
"Christianity, it stands, by its dogmatic portion or contents, in such"
"striking and irreconcilable, nay absolutely absurd contradiction with"
all the acquisitions and principles of modern science that its future
tragical fate can only be a question of time. But even its ethical
contents or its moral principles are in no way essentially distinguished
"above those of other peoples, and were equally well and in part better"
"known to mankind even _before_ its appearance. Not only in this respect,"
"but also in its supposed character as the _world-religion_, it is"
excelled by the much older and probably most widely diffused religious
"system in the world, the celebrated _Buddhism_, which recognizes"
"neither the idea of a personal God, nor that of a personal duration,"
"and nevertheless teaches an extremely pure, amiable, and even ascetic"
"""I shall be ready enough for that; you can reckon on me."""
"How the day passed Grey never knew, and it was still broad daylight when"
"he and his comrades started for the gardens of Vauxhall, where it was"
the fashion to spend the evening hours when nothing more attractive
"offered, and where such music and such illuminations as the times had to"
"offer were to be enjoyed, and where ladies and their attendant beaux"
"fluttered about like so many gay butterflies, and found opportunity as"
the dusk fell for walks and talks of a more private nature in the bosky
alleys and shady paths than they could hope to gain in crowded routs and
"card-parties.  Supper could be obtained too, and pleasant little parties"
made up; and the fashionable world found it agreeable on these hot
summer nights to take their pleasure out in the open air.
"Grey detached himself from his friends upon the first opportunity, and"
"wandered alone through the gardens, avoiding encounters with persons he"
"knew, though often accosted with laugh and jest and challenge by masked"
"ladies, or young bloods eager to make friends with one whose face and"
"figure began to be known, owing to his successes in horsemanship with"
"Don Carlos, and his friendship with Lord Sandford.  But Grey made small"
"response to overtures, quickly shook himself free, and pursued his"
"solitary ramble, till at length a sound of gay voices, laughter, and"
"almost uproarious mirth, in which the tones of Lord Sandford could"
"plainly be heard, drew him to a wide open space where an illuminated"
"fountain seemed to have drawn a great concourse of people; and there,"
"amid a tossing crowd of gaudy gallants, and ladies with towering heads,"
"mincing, giggling, uttering little shrieks, little jests, or playing off"
"an infinitude of coquetries and artifices to attract admiration, he"
beheld the stately white-robed figure around which his thoughts and
fancies had been playing all through the long hours of the day.
worse would perhaps have followed (τάχα ἄν τι καὶ τῶν ὑπὸ κόλπου
ἐπράττετο)[1483].”
"The inferences which may be drawn from this narrative are, first, that"
"the mysteries in general, while reproducing in some dramatic form the"
"whole story of the deities concerned, culminated in the representation"
of a mystic marriage between men and gods; (the birth of a child was
"also represented or announced in this parody, as we know that it"
"was at Eleusis[1484], but it had, I am inclined to think, no mystic"
significance otherwise than as proof of the consummation of that
"marriage;) and, secondly, that the wild charges of indecency brought by"
early Christian writers against the mysteries are baseless; for Lucian
condemns a much lesser license in this parody than that which they
attributed to the genuine rites.
"Thus our examination of the mysteries, so far as they are known to us,"
tends to prove that the doctrines revealed in them to the initiated
were simply a development of certain vaguer popular ideas which have
been prevalent among the Greek folk from the classical age down to our
own day. The people entertained hopes that this physical life would
continue in a similar form after death; the mysteries gave definite
assurance of that immortality by exhibiting to the initiated Persephone
or Adonis or Attis restored from the lower world in bodily form; and
"though that exhibition was in fact merely a dramatic representation,"
yet to the eyes of religious ecstasy it seemed just as much a living
reality as does the risen Christ in the modern celebration of Easter.
The people again were wont to think and to speak of death as a marriage
into the lower world; the mysteries showed to the initiated certain
"representatives of mankind who by death, or even in life, had been"
"admitted to the felicity of wedlock with deities, and thereby confirmed"
the faithful in their happier hopes of being in like manner themselves
god-beloved and of sharing the life of gods.

"Oh, come on, Dad, there's no cash in here."
"Just a bunch of cards that say, ""I farted on your car,"""
with his insurance info.
(moans sadly)
Busted.
"Geez, it's so weird that Mom and Dad would leave the house without their purse and wallet."
I wonder where they are?
Can I get you anything else?
"Uh, two more Cokes, please."
Could you excuse me?
(keypad beeping)
(phone rings)
Hello.
"Damone, it's Peter."
I'm at my date and I left my wallet at home.
"Will you please borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet, and bring it back here?"
"Damone, are you there?"
Hello..
- Are you Ria?
We admitted Karthi in the hospital.
- What happened?
He got 3 bullets in the shootout with gangsters.
Situation is too critical.
He actually wanted to retire from Police job but has continued for you.
"When he said to join as a stuntman, I refused."
I committed a big mistake.
It is a lie that there is another one like me.
I am not a Police as you are thinking.
I am a stuntman.
Bruce Lee!
I tried many times to tell this to you but could not say it.
It was not to cheat you.
Due to lack of courage..
Reason was the fear that you would leave afar.
I'm sorry!
I am loving you not your profession.
Love you

You didn't know Monica was gonna be here.
"Did you, Figgs?"
No.
Monica said she was going over to her friend's house to watch some pay-per-view.
The thing was on a timer.

"Ya look great, kid."
Ya look sensational.
Max'
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
"But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program."
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out fuckin' cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away.
We start to go in the fuckin' joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.
I don't want to fuckin' turn around.
I don't want to turn around.
"He picks up his fucking head, he says, ""Ah...."""
"I said, ""Don't say it! """
"""Jerkoff! """
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I fucking fly at him!
"I got him and I'm banging his head, biting his fuckin' face."
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a fuckin' pulp.
"To a fuckin' pulp, I tells ya."
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight.
Forget about it.
It was like a load off my mind.
Poor bastard.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I had told him he would have never believed me.
"-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?"
-You're a pisser.
Kike.
Did you hurt my baby?
"No, I..."
You son of a bitch.
"What did you do, where is he?"
Where is he?
I don't know!
You're going to find him.
"As God is my witness, you are going to find him."
"Yes... yes, you!"
"I'll call the police, I swear to God."
I swear to God I will throw you back in that cage
If you don't bring my baby home.
"Baby, how the fuck am I supposed to know"
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck.
"I don't give a fuck, you will figure it out."
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, okay."
"Fuck, I'm ready to go inside and get in shape."
I think my baby girl is in for a treat tonight.
"(Man) Yo, that's the shorty that wanted me to wifey it up,"
But she let the next nigga hit it.
"I was like, ""How you want me to wifey it up"""
"And you let dude hit?"""
"Shit, that's why you can't trust these bitches, man."
"(Pete) Can't trust niggas, neither, man."
"Yo, she even got the name ""Danny"" tattooed on her pussy,"
"But I don't know if it was for me,"
"'Cause that nigga's named Danny, too."
(Laughing)
-So of course you'll take it.
-I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
-Michael.
-Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
-About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
-And what were they?
"Well, Michael, I've lied for so long."
"I was everything you said, specially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you could've never wanted me.
-I had no right to say those things.
"-Yes, you did."
-And I'm here to tell you the truth.
-You don't owe me explanations.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide... but because she hated me.
She won't answer my letters or phone calls.
Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
-She told me Allison and Norman...
-I know about the phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"And, without thinking, when Allison returned I told her some terrible things."
-What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
"I'm gonna give it back, but I need the ticket."
Where's the ticket?
It's my show -
This is the plan.
I'm docking you for being an asshole.
And I'm docking Gig for having people killed.
"And I'm docking Crystal for being a twisted, psycho bitch!"
"Starting today, i decide where the money goes."
"If anyone doesn't like it, we're all going to jail."
- [ Gasps ]
- You give me that ticket.
Where is it?
Where is the ticket?
I..
I gave it to Larry King.
"Uh, no..."
Got to learn to share your toys!
[Dan] The search is over.
The winneroflast month's $6.4 million lottery jackpot... has finally stepped forward.
She's a waitress at a local Denny's right here in Harrisburg.
Pennsylvania's newest multimillionaire is Wendy Fawcett.
Thankyou so much!
I don't know what to say.
I've never won anything before in my life.
"[ Woman ] Wendy, what are you gonna do with the money?"
I'm going to put some in savings and some of it in checking.
And the rest I'll be sharing with a good friend.
- And who's that?
- I'm not telling you!
[ Cackling ]
"And we're giving a lot of it away to the Big Brothers, the Sunshiny Day Club, Asthma..."
- [Man] Do you have asthma?
- Yes.
"""owns extensive properties in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk."""
"""Cedar Chase has been the family seat since the 17th century."""
"""The grounds..."""
"""include a private lake and several hundred acres of manageable land."""
"Bugger me, they're loaded."
What's this sudden obsession with money?
It's not like any of us are paupers.
"Well, El's father filed for bankruptcy over the summer."
Shit!
I'm so sorry.
"Doesn't buy you happiness though, right?"
"I mean, look at Mr. Gimp, case in point."
"Oh, he's all right."
He's kinda cute.
"In a sweaty, loser kind of way."
"Uh, I know he brings out the maternal in you girls or something, but honestly, I think..."
I think he's a creep.
"Oh, you should write that in his birthday card."
"Did, uh, you just use the word ""maternal"" to describe me?"

She don't want to believe that the boy is using drugs... but he comes home every day with bloodshot eyes... and then he eats everything in the kitchen.
She knows he didn't get those red eyes... from being in the library.
I hear the boy can't even read.
"Good morning, Mr. Moses."
What do you think?
"You think this is something, check this out."
What do you think?
"Look, girls, y'all just gonna have to wait in line."
"Mr. Moses, let's make a trade."
I'll trade you The Best of Wynton Marsalis... for Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday.
Never!
I would never give up any of my records for anything.
It would be like cutting off one of my hands.
"Jeff, you're right."
"Got to go younger, huh?"
Yeah.
I'm getting me girls on Soul Train.
"Have a good day, Mr. Moses."
"- Good morning, Mrs. Walker."
"- Morning, Jeff."

No... thank you.

"Hey, Jeff, ready for tonight?"
You know I am.
First show's sold out.
So if that bug hitched a ride on Aldo's body...
We need to call Booth.
"Uh, Brennan said Booth's busy."
"What, too busy to hear about this?"
"Trust me, it's important."
(crickets chirping)
Sergeant.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, too long."
I wish it was for a different occasion.
"Yeah, me, too."
"Who killed him, Seeley?"
"I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out."
Need my help?
"No, I'm good."
"But either of you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo before he, uh, went missing?"
Not me.
He wasn't easy to find.
"All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know."
"It's my job now to take care of things, okay?"
"Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen."
"You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now."
This is about Aldo.
Guess that's what it takes-- one of us dying before he comes around here.
"Oh, come on, Ted, you know he had nothing to do with Father Clemens' murder."
Yeah.
What did Booth do to help him stay alive?
Not enough.
We all could have been more in touch with him.
DAVE:
He's the reason that we're all home.
"At least for me, I'm grateful."
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me.
I want to see that.
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
It's-
You know what?
This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.
I know something new we could do.
"Jackie, Donna, get naked."
The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
"- Hello, friends of Fez."
- Hi.
Where's Nina?
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.
- [All] Ooh!
- Uh-oh.
That's the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
"Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she's dumping you."
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.
- [All] Oh!
- That ain't good.
"- Oh, what's the big deal?"
"- Oh, man, I can't tell him."
"This is a job for someone who's cold, heartless and just inhuman."
"Jackie, go for it."
"Fez, when a girl says, ""It's not you, it's me""... what she really means is it's you."
- So I have really been dumped.
- [Hyde] Yep.
And here's another tip.
"When a girl says she just wants to be friends... it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she's not gonna put out."
"So, you know, heads-up on that one."
Yep.
Women'll screw you over every chance they get.
This young man has departed from our midst.
"The Lord gave, the Lord bath taken away."
Let us pray.
Come in.
"Just put the coffee on the table, please."
-You're Sarah Beth;
-Yes.
Your--
-Please sit.
-There's no need for that.
I have something to say and then I'm going.
-How did you know I was here;
-l have a room at the hotel.
The clerk told me.
I'm not gonna let you hurt Pop anymore.
He can't stand any more.
"Maybe you couldn't hurt him, even if you tried."
"Maybe there's not anything that can hurt him, not after Brock."
I hope so because nobody can stand any more.
Even him.
So maybe the pain's over now.
Unless you've brought him more.
Have you;
What do you want of him;
Nothing.
I came to help Brock.
I didn't know he-- l didn't know until the train was almost here.
"I'm not even going to see your father, Sarah Beth."
"I might try if I thought I could make up a little to him and to you for all the years, but I know I couldn't."
He tried to tell me how he felt.
How the grass was somehow godly to him.
He tried to tell me and I didn't hear.
They're making your mind into mush!
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed."
"Jesus Christ, what happened to you?"
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
Get over here.
"- Doc, I'm fine."
- Let me check you out.
Come on.
"He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium and sent me home."
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
"Right in front of us, there."
I think it's been following me all morning.
- Get the fuck out.
"What are you, nuts?"
- I'm telling you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
"Well, I guess you can't have cake today."
What if it's my leg?
"Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages."
Claire:
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
"Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"This is my new friend, Charlie."
"He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye."
"Hi, Charlie!"
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
"Oh, do you have to go so soon?"
He smells so good!
"Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony."
(sighs)
What is going on?
"I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit."
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
"When Manny goes, you still have Joe."
"Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less."
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
"Luke has a job, and he's dating."
He can serve on a jury.
"- Rick, stop him!"
- Hey!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
[ Man ] What's the matter?
It's not cold.
"[ Woman ] Bobby, it's cold!"
"Come on, Diane."
[ Woman Screeches ]
"[ Man Talking, Indistinct ] [ Both Laughing ]"
[ Bobby ] What's the matter?
[ Diane Screeches ] Bobby!
"Oh, I'm gonna get you."
No.
It's cold!
"[ Bobby ] Come on, Diane."
Let's go swimming.
[ Screeches ]
[ Giggling ]
"Diane, you're gonna be at sea before Jessie even realizes you've left the club."
Jessie doesn't scare me.
"Well, if it's Dutch--"
"It's you, Bobby."
"Diane, I love you, and I'm gonna marry you."
That's what scares me.
"All of this is just-- It's all too good to be true, and I just keep thinking that something's gonna happen to spoil it."
Like what?
I don't know.
That's because nothing's gonna happen.
"In two hours, we're gonna be married, and you'll be on the boat to San Diego."
"And when I join you next month, we're gonna have the rest of our lives to raise beautiful little girls... just like you... and nasty little boys just like me."
"Bobby, if something did go wrong, you wouldn't ever forget me, would you?"
Will you just stop it and listen to me?
None of them fit.
I'm not paying for it!
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye."
Stop with those fuckin' drugs.
They're making your mind into mush!
Ya hear me?
I'll take 'em back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
"And since I was going to see them later in the afternoon, to pick up a delivery I was pretty sure I'd get my money back."
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got there at the hospital to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted to put me in bed."
Jesus Christ!
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident driving' over here.
And I said I was partying all night.
"No, I'm fine, doc."
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
"He took mercy on me, gave me Valium and sent me home."
"Now, my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen."
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right in front of us there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
-Get the fuck out.
Are you nuts?
-l'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
How come you're having a party on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?
"Christine was out of town, we couldn't get it together"
- and it worked out this Saturday.
- Why even have it all?
"Why not just forget it, wait till next year?"
- You blew it.
"- Yeah, I know."
"I wish we could've done it last week, but we couldn't get it together."
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.
Kind of reminds me a little of like President's Day.
It's not really the President's birthday.
It's some other day.
What am I doing?
You know...
Right.
We're back.
Let's start at the top of the scene.
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.
She's like completely bullshitting this guy 'cause he's blind.
- By the way...
- Yeah.
Thank you for coming to meet Kim.
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.
She just moved out here from the city.
"This is his first daughter, and she calls me like Uncle Richard."
- I've known her since she was born.
- Really?
"That's fun, ""Uncle Richard."""
"Yeah, but the problem is she's an actress, a singer, talented but she wants to get her breasts enlarged, and it's gonna drive Kenny crazy..."
I heard you got into an accident.
I only found out after I got out of the hospital.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
"Oh, I-I'm fine now."
What happened?
It seems weird.
I'm going to your house right now with your stuff.
I'm close by so I'll be there soon.
Okay.
She said she's coming here...
Good.
"I was too busy to get Yoon Jae's things, but I guess she's doing it instead."
What about Yoon Jae's hospital?
Do I have to start working tomorrow?
You can't do that.
Say that because of the accident you need rest and get a break.
Then what about the marriage?
Do I have to do that too?
!
"Until then, he must come back."
He must.
"Even if he doesn't, I'm not planning on doing that for him too."
Do you want to clean while we're waiting for Se Young?
"Hah, I had to clean Yoon Jae's body."
Do I have to clean his house too?
No thanks.
"When you meet Se Young, have your manners and don't look at her with weird eyes."
I'll stare at her with open eyes.
Where is the vacuum?
"Oh, this is heavy."
I guess it wasn't an empty bag.
Looks like Yoon Jae packed his suitcase.
Hey.
Keep your lens up here.
"Guys, Martin Scorsese."
-pleasure to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.
hello.
"I've been listening to your stuff, I Iike it."
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
"That's amazing, actually."
So amazing.
"I've been giving her stuff, and then she gives me stuff."
'm a big  One Direction fan.
They're gonna go all the way.
They're gonna go higher.
"Next time you see them, we're gonna be in wembley Stadium or Giants Stadium."
That's right.
And I'II be right there in the front row.
t's strange going from being around your family constantly to being with these guys.
But lik e knowing that there's four of your best mates it's a great feeling to know that you're not in it by yourself.
I can't believe I'm at MSG!
I'm just a little boy from Bradford and now I'm smashing it!
And you sort of feel so proud.
You feel like your heart could burst sometimes.
AII right.
Let's give it our all.
"Come on, guys."
Come on!
n the back of your mind  there's always this bit of feeling  that you gotta kind of be ready to pick up the pieces if it stops.
And it hasn't stopped.
Sing it!
You sing!
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
Will you be voting?
-You're running in the 6th District?
-l am.
"Well, 6th District is my district."
I'm very interested in who'll represent me.
I'm interested that you're interested.
"As Huey Long once said, and I quote:"
"""""lf you got a friend, you got a vote. """""
-Did he say that?
-He sure did.
He told me to move to the 6th District.
He said the people are special.
-So do I have your vote?
-You can count on it.
That's one.
No.
"More than one, actually."
I hear Elaine Santos is ready to stand up for you.
Sounds like a groundswell.
I wish I could tell you I won but I got thrashed by a Dominican from 104th Street.
"I got branded an outsider, and I was never in it."
"But I'll be back in 2 years, and I'll win."
You know why?
I'm willing to be lucky.
And if you're willing to be lucky New York will give you a chance.

New York City.
So many things have been said about it  but there's only one I really like.
"""New York  it can destroy you or fulfill you, depending a good deal on luck. """
No one should come here unless he's willing to be lucky.
I missed the exit.
I went all the way to Yong Moon.
-How could you go that far?
-I know right?
How can I go that far?
Who are we talking about?
Me.
-Why didn't you answer the phone?
"-I didn't bring it, you know."
I thought you got into an accident.
I was going out to look for a car accident.
You called all of the sudden and told me to leave in 10 minutes.
I was in a hurry.
3 minute shower. 3 minutes to change. 3 minutes to do hair.
-I left at the right time.
-I have to be back by office by 4:30.
You're an hour and 30 minutes late.
We only have an hour and 30 minutes left!
I said I'm sorry.
You can kill me ok?
"Just be positive, hmm?"
"Oh geez, we have an hour and half left."
It's only 10 minutes short from 100 minutes.
It's 10 times 9 minutes.
We even had 14 minute dates before.
When there was an accident in your office.
What do you have in your head?
"I made an absurd excuse to get out of meeting, so that I can see you here."
"10, 20, 30, 40 minutes."
You made me think that you were in an accident.
A big one.
I thought you were unconscious.
Mom says you're not allowed to call me that.
"Well, it all started three weeks ago when I got into a small but very severe car accident."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- What's the other thing
Dr. Ellie told Anna-Kat to do to stay calm?
"Oh, yes!"
Sing a song in your head!
No!
Not that song!
Too late!
♪ Don't let them in ♪
♪ Don't let them see ♪
♪ Be the good girl you always have to be ♪ ...stops.
I hit him.
- Oh!
"- So I'm driving... ♪ Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know ♪"
♪ But now they know ♪
What are you doing?
We spent three years getting that song out of this house.
It's spilling out.
♪ Let it go ♪
♪ Let it go ♪
"Oh, dear Lord."

"Honey, you have got to calm down."
Isn't it a good thing your mom has someone to talk to?
"Now we've got the neediest woman in the world coming together with the biggest attention whore in the world, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid."
"So, no!"
Not good!
I'm gonna use a word...
Selfless.
You didn't want to ruin their holiday by not showing up.
I noticed a couple of parking tickets on his car.
"I guess he's got a couple parking tickets on his car, so maybe we should check on him."
And I also invited Big Joe to stop by the party.
"Okay, but I hope he doesn't wear that tacky rent-a-cop uniform."
I thought we were just inviting close friends.
"Yeah, uh, well, Big Joe's really cool."
And he's helping me with the chairs.
He's standing here right now.
Don't worry.
I own other outfits.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna...
go check on Mr. Bezzerides.
Okay then.
"Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?"
"Everyone's kinda worried about you, so I'm going to go ahead and come inside, okay?"
Mr. Bezzerides?
(GROWLING) (LOUD CLANKING)
It was a sure thing.
"No, it obviously wasn't a sure thing."
"He lost, Jasper."
"No, he was a sure thing up until the moment he lost."
That makes zero sense.
(DOOR OPENS)
What the fuck?
These are shots of our living room.
"(CHUCKLES) Mr. ""Bitch-arabies"" is a peeping tom."
"Yeah, I though that, too, but why take photos of our empty living room?"
Looks like he saved the best ones for his private collection.
What is this thing?
I-I think it's a camera.
See?
"-But she looks so, so..."
-Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
A few days care and she'll be out of it.
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And, Connie, just because it happened in your house... don't think that any of it was your fault."
-Somehow I do.
-You've got one thing to think of:
Allison.
"If you were going to get married, why didn't you tell me?"
-Because you wouldn't have approved.
-You never gave me a chance.
"At least, it would've been a proper marriage... not a cheap sneak-off weekend affair."
-Don't say that!
"-Well, what was it?"
-I'd like to talk to you alone.
-You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
-I'll wait outside.
"-Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
"Look, dad, I don't want any trouble between us."
"I was in love with Betty and I wanted to marry her, that's all."
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
"Good-bye, dad."
-Don't bring her to the house.
-Then I won't be there either.
"Rodney, what about college?"
I'm not going.
I have a wife to support.
"Oh, no."
"I'm... too sleepy, I guess."
You ask Joe.
"Joe is probably hungry, though."
"Joe, you talk with Mother and dads."
They can help anybody.
"You see, mother and dads, Joe isn't very well."
Sometimes he doesn't realize what he's saying.
"But it's all right, Joe."
You can talk with mother and dads.
They're wonderful.
"You've probably never had anyone like them, because you wouldn't have had all the trouble you've had."
"Every now and then, Joe thinks he has a son like me."
He even calls me Joey.
It was funny.
"I wasn't afraid of him,"
But...
He's a good scout.
He's ok.
Good night.
"Can I get you something to eat, Joe?"
Thank you for bringing him back.
"With all my heart, I thank you."
"You are proud of him, aren't you?"
"He is the kind of a boy you really hoped for, isn't he?"
"Isn't he, Joe?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.
"He ain't the kind of kid I'd put my money on, exactly."
"You got him conned into one way of thinking, so what the heck?"
"Let him stay that way, for all I give a darn."
"He didn't swallow what I told him, anyway."
"So his DNA is at a murder scene... and he's not the victim, so what does that leave?"
Is he a witness or is he just someone who happens to be there?
I'm gonna double-check the results.
"I'm gonna triple check them, okay?"
There's a possibility that the DNA is old.
20 years!
"I'm saying it's possible, okay?"
He may not have been there.
"Mark, just think about it."
It's Jesse!
- I know.
"- It means he's alive, yeah?"
"Yeah I know, you're right."
"I know, I know..."
"It's what we always wanted, isn't it?"
"Oh man, it doesn't make any sense to me."
"What am I gonna tell my Mum, Dad?"
"Nothing, not yet, okay?"
"Look, I shouldn't even be talking to you guys."
I could get fired.
Sorry.
This thing could end up being public.
I mean it's the sort of thing the papers have been all over.
"Yeah well, if it comes to that we'll let them know."
But don't you think there's someone else we should tell?
Someone who was with us that day.
Pru?
Come on.
"Dad, I wanna ask you something."
Do you remember him?
"This is Jesse, Dad."
You remember he went missing as a young boy?
"I had to, to make him quiet."
"""And then I didn't know what to do."
He was too heavy.
It was too far to the river.
So I left him.
Things kept going bad when I got back to our street.
His mum was already looking for him.
Thom!
Thom?
"""So I went behind mrs Bailey's house, where dad found that weird guy."
"That's where I had to leave the jacket."""
Christy.
Christy?
Ben!
Where's the phone?
I thought dad would still be asleep.
Must have been right behind me.
"""Things kept going wrong."
I went back for the jacket it was gone.
"And then I found out you were looking for a torch, so I thought if I put dad's torch back, you'd leave him alone."
"On Christmas day, I heard dad get up early."
I followed him up to mrs Bailey's house and I found the jacket there.
""" That weird man must have taken it."
"""All I had to do was put it back in her house."
""" Now ""her"", meaning ms murnane?"
But mum mum made it hard.
"""I just wanted us to have a normal Christmas."""
But it wasn't.
"""I came back with Tash, but then she came over."""
"We'd only been gone a day, and she was already after dad."
Thom was gone.
We'd gone.
Please leave a message.
"Hi, baby."
"It's me, Stan."
"I was just sitting here on my bed eating dinner by myself, and I'm looking at the place where we, you know, were last night, and..."
Holy cow!
It's still warm!
"Oh, wait."
That's because I put my spaghetti pot on it.
I make a good sauce.
"I take a jar of Paul Newman's, and I add..."
"Wait, what happened?"
I slept with him.
"No, with the sauce."
What did he add?
I picked the worst person to have a one-night stand with.
He's a parent at Ritchie's school!
"He's depressed, he's needy."
"Well, it sounds like you two have a lot in common."
"What was I thinking going to the supermarket, picking up a random guy for sex?"
Huh.
"Out loud, it sounds foolproof."
"Oh, this is awful."
Sad Dad isn't going away.
"""Sad Dad""?"
Isn't that sweet.
You guys already have pet names for each other.
"Shut up, Matthew-- you've got to help me."
"Just pick up the phone and tell him the truth-- he was a one-night stand, and you never want to see him again."
No.
I'm gonna handle this my way.
I'll cut my bangs and eat a Dove bar and go to bed.
"Hey, did you hear that?"
"No, failed; drinks are to the right."
But I wanted to give you a tiara.
Don't know if that's quite allowed.
Who's going to have giggles first?
Everett.
You're all very symmetrical at the moment.
Tonight's soup is asparagus soup.
Zachary.
Seem to have miscalculated somewhat.
Is there any more soup?
Ah.
I'm afraid cook didn't make enough soup.
"Tonight was quite strange, almost seeing them as, like, normal people."
"We've always looked up at them and I found it almost quite unbearable and uncomfortable to be served by them and I mean constantly I felt myself, like, wanting to help them."
"I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Mason."
Yes.
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO LIGHT.
"AND IF YOU'RE LIFTING A WEIGHT, YOU COULD STOP."
IT STILL HURTS.
JOE'S GONNA FIND THE BURN.
"NICE, DUDE, KEEP THOSE ELBOWS BACK AT THE TOP."
"WHAT NUMBER YOU ON, MR. HAAS?"
"THAT WAS IT, 16."
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE?
"ALL RIGHT, I CAN TRUST YOU."
"NOW, HOW WERE THE BANDS, WAS THAT THE RIGHT BAND?"
"YEAH, IT'S THE RIGHT BAND."
"I JUST HAD A BIGGER LOOP, SO."
"BY THE WAY, THERE YOU GO."
"YOU MAKE YOUR LOOP BIGGER, YOU MAKE IT HARDER."
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A HEAVIER-DUTY BAND.
"OKAY, FOLKS, WE GOT CROUCHING COHEN CURL."
In here!
"Joey's in trouble, Ray."
"Ray, let's just break the fuckin' thing down."
Got it.
God.
"His father is serving a life sentence for murder, murdering an ex-girlfriend... with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988."
The New York Times is quoting one friend of Royster as saying... that the guy had an IQ of 160.
I need your help.
They're tryin' to kill me.
- Who?
"- ""Who""?"
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan tried to kill me.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Speak of the devil!
"Freddy, forget it."
I don't get this.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why'd they get Superboy off the bridge... to bring him back here and kill him?
Ray had a plan... and it got very fucked up.
"You awake, Freddy?"
I feel like shit.
Fuckin' allergies are killin' me.
Hey.
"In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord, Jesus Christ... we commend to Almighty God our brother Joseph... and we commit his body to the ground."
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make His face to shine upon him... and be gracious unto him.
The Lord lift up His countenance upon him... and give him peace.
"Honor Guard, retreat."
"- No, I don't know."
- What the hell are you doing?
"WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM WHAT OPPONENTS COULD EXPECT FROM HIM,"
"ROBINSON REPLIED, ""THEY BETTER BE ROUGH ON ME,"
"BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE ROUGH ON THEM."""
RACHEL ROBINSON:
"JACK SAID, ""WE'VE GOT THIS THING GOING."
"""THE TEAM IS WINNING."
I'M DOING WELL.
"I'M GONNA SPEAK OUT."""
AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHALLENGE OTHER BALLPLAYERS
AND CHALLENGE UMPIRES WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE.
MAN AS JACKIE:
SPORTSWRITERS SEEMED TO COME DIRECTLY TO ME
WHENEVER THERE WAS A HINT OF A STORY.
THEY KNEW I WOULD SAY WHAT I THOUGHT.
THEY KNEW I WOULDN'T BACK DOWN IF I GOT INTO TROUBLE...
THAT I WOULDN'T WHINE THAT I WAS MISQUOTED.
"IT FELT GOOD TO BREATHE FREELY, TO SPEAK OUT WHEN I WANTED TO."
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, ROBINSON PLAYED BETTER THAN HE EVER HAD."
"BY MID-JULY, HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN HITS, BATTING AVERAGE,"
"STOLEN BASES, AND RUNS BATTED IN."
"WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE TALLIED FOR THE 1949 ALL-STAR GAME,"
ONLY RED SOX OUTFIELDER TED WILLIAMS HAD RECEIVED MORE.
CARL ERSKINE:
"YOU KNOW, KIDS, THEY'RE HONEST."
"AND WHEN A KID CAME BACK 3 TIMES FOR MY AUTOGRAPH, I SAID,"
"""WHY WOULD YOU WANT THREE OF MINE?"""
"WELL, HE WAS HONEST."
"HE SAID, ""ACTUALLY I WANT SIX."""
"""IF I CAN GET SIX OF YOURS,"""
"""I COULD TRADE IT FOR ONE OF JACKIE ROBINSON'S."""
NARRATOR:
-Don't follow me.
-Gyung Joon...!
-Leave me alone!
-Gyung Joon...
-Why?
Are you scared that your precious Yoon Jae is going to be seen as a ruthless jerk?
Are you going to cry again?
"Then before I do more, leave me alone and go."
"I'm sure you're upset after hearing those words, so how can I go and leave you alone?"
Don't pretend that you're worried.
You're just like my uncle!
"You're worried that I'll always stay in this precious Yoon Jae's body, right?"
"Just like my uncle, you don't like me and are burdened by me, so why are you pretending to worry?"
Gyung Joon...
"I told you the more things are like this, the more I'll do things my way."
Da Ran!
Yoon Jae...
Did you just shove my sister?
Why are you yelling at my sister?
Choong Sik...
It isn't something for you to get involved in.
Just go.
He was being weird to you this morning at school.
I came to see what was going on...
And it's a good thing that I came.
Yoon Jae...
I really didn't take you to be like this.
But you're weird...
Yoon Jae!
(Mae-Hyung = Brother-in-law)
I'm not your brother-in-law!
If it's your husband...
Fantastic.
Thank you.
Yeah.
"So, it's almost 3:00."
Are you still going to give that lecture on emergency C-Sections?
"Oh gosh, no."
I have a date with Riley.
Could you cover for me?
Really?
Do you think I'm qualified to?
"Sara, I think you show great promise as an obstetrician."
"Oh, my God."
Thank you so much.

I mean...
"- Yeah, no, yeah."
- Okay.
All right.
"- So, have you..."
"- Um, yes?"
- ... bartended before?
"- I have, I've bartended a lot, actually."
"The last, I was in Greece, I worked at a taverna for a while in Athens, Greece."
"And then I did a little bit of bartending in Mykonos, 'cause I was there, and I bartended in"
"Chicago at a little club, but I hated the manager."
I'm not gonna give you his reference.
I hated his guts.
I actually took his keys and I threw them in the snow 'cause I knew he wouldn't find them 'til the springtime.
I just couldn't stand that guy.
"I mean, I know I shouldn't be telling you that, 'cause here I am trying to get a job, but..."
"And then I've been everywhere but pretty much, like, North and South Dakota,"
I've never been.
"But I love Black Hills Gold, so I should go there one day, right?"
Are you all right?
You look--
- I've had a tough day.
- Oh.
"I'm sorry, let me just.."
"God, it's driving me crazy, your eyes are, like, soaking wet."
"They're, like, soaking wet."
Do you have an allergy problem or something?
- Um.
"- Look, Iâm gonna just go like this."
- Okay.
- And you're just gonna breathe.
- I would think.
"Anyway, like I said, but f or this woman Elaine,"
I definitely would've called you.
"Well, thanks f or stopping by."
You bet.
Hi.
[ Laughing ] I r eally do have to work her e.
"No, listen, I was just thinking -- I r eally like you."
"I mean, these little conversations have been kind of f un, and I was wondering if you'd like to maybe have a drink later."
"Oh, that's -- that's r eally sweet of you."
"But no, thanks."
This thing with Elaine isn't that serious.
-
- Who's Elaine?
-
- Exactly.
"Dan, l-I r eally have got work to do."
-
"- Look, do you want -- -"
"- Dan, I'm flatter ed, honestly, but I'm just not inter ested."
"Hey, you don't have to hit me over the head."
[ Both chuckle ]
At least you don't have to do it seven or eight times.
It was good talking to you.
"Yeah, it was a r eal clambake."
"I'm gonna go scrape my self-image off the floor and then get r eady to do my show, which, um, by the way, can be seen every night on your network."
I'll keep an eye out f or it.
Ex cellent.
[ Chuckles ]
What?
I just thought of a f unny visual.
I may need mor e time in the 20s.
Yikes.
"Okay, for your information, Richard, I have had plenty of sex."
I don't tell you everything.
I've had it under my belt.
"Over my belt, around my belt."
"You know, I've pretty much worn out my belt."
Really?
So plenty of sex?
"Hey, when I gots to have it, I gots to have it."
"Look, it's not a competition."
You'll be ready when you're ready.
"Hey, I'm ready."
I'm ready right now.
Then I gots to go.
I didn't mean from you.
I got plenty guys coming here to get some sex...
"All right, what about the one with the mystic tan and the butterfly clip?"
"Yep, I think she's having sex, too."
Are you kidding me?
What about you?
Are you doing it?
"You know, maybe sex isn't your thing."
Maybe your thing is more having awkward conversations with your employees.
Sex used to be my thing.
"God, in fact, senior year in high school, I was a little bit of a slut."
That's what I was known for.
"I mean, that and my laugh."
You do have a nice laugh.
"Oh, thanks."
"God, I used to be fun."
"Then I became a mom, you know."
I used to be turned on by the touch of a man.
"There's always going to be a little J in you and a lot of ""D"" in me."
"Well, we did it."
That's the worst conversation of all time.
"Don't worry about it, man."
I'm not even bummed out that you're moving out.
That's OK
"That's so weird because your pants are on fire but you're a liar, liar."
I spent all day dividing up our stuff.
Most of it was pretty obvious.
- All the make-up was...
- It's sunscreen!
Alright?
Don't piss me off.
Look.
Just admit that you're sad.
Why don't you get off my butt?
"What am I, Kanye West?"
I don't know what that means but let me ask you a question.
"Two weeks from now when you walk into that empty room and I'm not there, what are you gonna do?"
I'm probably gonna be doing a lot of this.
Because that's where I'm going to put my new Nordic Track.
OK.
We need to stop them from fighting.
Yeah for sure.
I agree.
Why don't you just call me when you have that figured out.
- Wait.
I don't have your phone number.
- I know.
I don't have anyone's number.
Get off your Nordic Track and talk to me.
- What is that?
And he was right.
Those years are gone and my chance with them.
"I'll leave tonight, Sarah Beth."
But I'm not sorry I came now because I'll take something back with me which means a great deal to me.
The knowledge that he has you.
"You to fight for him, be there when he needs you."
To be what I wasn't strong enough to be.
He didn't come to St. Louis for nothing.
"And now when he's lost it all, everything when he needs something human at last you'll come into the field."
"No, he didn't come to St. Louis for nothing."
"And all at once, that gives me peace a kind of happiness even."
I haven't felt that for a very long time.
Just one thing.
"Some night when he's sitting on the porch, Sarah Beth, give him a kiss from me."
"Don't, Mother."
Don't.
"I'm glad you're home, colonel."
Buckboard with Sarah Beth get in;
I missed seeing her start.
"Maybe you'd better go on in the house, colonel."
jim:
Sarah Beth;
"-Papa, come here."
"Mother wanted to be waiting for you here, Papa."
The way she used to be.
Lutie.
You're well;
"Yes, Jim."
And you;
You look as you always did.
"Do I, Jim;"
Papa.
But maybe he's what we need to mix with our blood now that we've lost belle Reve and have to go on without belle Reve to protect us.
"Oh, how pretty the sky is."
I ought to go there on a rocket that never comes down.
"Which way do we go now, stella?"
This way?
"No, hon, this way."
The blind are leading the blind.
Red hots!
Are you going upstairs and tell her to cut that out?
"If I go up, I won't come down."
Let's just forget it.
Remember that night she poured boiling water through them cracks in the floor?
I gotta go home pretty soon.
"-Come on, what do you say?"
"-No, I'm out."
"Every time you win a big pot, you're out like stout."
I got a sick mother and she don't go to sleep...
-...until I get in.
-What do you say?
I'm gonna wash up.
-stella?
"-Yes, Eunice?"
You tell them guys the kettle's on the stove.
I'm gonna break up the game.
-What did she mean by that?
-She'II pour it straight through the cracks.
"stella, wait."
Wait till I powder.
I feel so hot and frazzled.
-Do I Iook done in?
-You look as fresh as a daisy.
One that's been picked a few days.
The day after tomorrow. you know what you gotta do out there. we've decided to get a little bit of insurance.
Don't fuck it up.

That kid just chose his ego over your life.
Can you believe that?
I just can't figure out why... this fuck hole would choose to get his goddamn neck slit to keep a fucking win streak!
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me?
Can you fucking tell me?
Can anybody fucking tell me?
Give it to Jimmy.
Pay 'em their fucking winnings.
I had this little black dog when I was a kid.
We tried like hell but it was so stupid.
Maybe it was retarded.
They got retarded dogs?
I don't know.
"Oh, I remember these."
Can we go again?
Sure.
I'm happy to take more of your money.
Gambling's awesome.
I think it's gonna be a problem for me later in life.
Whoo!
I feel good.
"- Me, too."
- Yeah.
"Mom, all you do is try to get attention, and all I do is yell at you."
We have got to figure out a way to stop that.
- Mm.
"- I mean, come on, Mom."
What is with this thing?
"Well, it's... it's from my car accident."
"I called you about it, but you never followed up."
Because you said it was nothing.
"When I hear the word ""nothing,"" I move on."
"Okay, can I just ask you..."
Why is it so hard for you to be there for me?
Seriously?
When were you there for me?
You picked a life of travel and adventure over being there for your kids!
"I sound happy, but I'm very upset!"
"Katie, I know that I wasn't a good parent."
"You know, whatever that thing was that's supposed to kick in just never kicked in."
"Well, maybe because you were such a crappy mom, that's why I try so hard to be a good mom."
Oh!
So I made you a good mom.
Mnh-mnh.
That's not what I'm saying.
"I mean, if her mother's not home, you know?"
"- But, who else gets paid to fuck?"
- Ho's.
"People, watch my shit."
Everybody on the floor!
"Hey, bruja!"
"You better not be drinking out of the bottle, you know how Carlos hates that."
Carlos?
That nigga ain't here.
Which one of your hooker friends is this one for?
"You should let me know, so I could roll up and fuck her."
Sometimes I wonder how we come from the same two people.
Get the fuck outta here.
We both got a talent for merchandising.
Merchandising?
Is that what you're calling it?
Merchandising?
Why don't you let a nigga set you up?
Set you up with a little shop.
We can keep all your shit there.
Because I can take care of all my shit right here in my house.
"It's all right, hermanita."
"One day, I'm gonna open you up a store, when you come back with me to the D.R., en la Calle del Sol, we could call it ""Maggie's."""
Yeah?
Give it to Darlene.
Are you trippin'?
You know Carlos ain't gonna take care of your ass.
Like everybody else in this motherfucker-- out for himself.
"You know what, hermanito?"
Why don't you support your kids...
y déjame de joder?
I was looking out for my little sister.
Who do you think you are?
"Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go."
That was the deal.
"The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse."
"Now, scrape it off!"
Start over again.
"Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer."
I'm a racecar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Is that right?
Then why don't we just have a little race?
Me and you.
- What?
- Me and you.
That a joke?
"If you win, you go and I fix the road."
"If I win, you do the road my way."
"Doc, what're you doin'?"
"I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what?"
Three-point-five years?
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
"You know what, old-timer?"
That's a wonderful idea.
Let's race.
"Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race."
"You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back."
"There will be no bumping', no cheatin', no spitting', no biting', no road rage, no maiming', no oil slickin', no pushing', no shoving', no backstabbing', no road-hoggin',"
and no lollygaggin'.
Speed.
I'm speed.
"Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer."
"My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop."
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
"- No, I'm not."
No harm done.
What's up... with y'all?
[Turk] Ahh!
"Hey, Dr. Turk."
What happened to you?
I found the latest issue at a comic book store a mile and a half away.
Here you go.
"Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care."
"Thanks, Dr. Turk."
"Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings."
No.
I'm married and trying to have a baby.
Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
You're a good surgeon.
"Plus, your bedside manner is really important."
There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients.
Are you saying I have a job?
"If you are trying to ""Kelly Ripa"" me right now, I will freak out."
I got a job!
"Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room."
I once found a head.
It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.
"I didn't have time to get to Lost and Found, forgot all about it."
"Come back to work on Monday, open my locker, whoa!"
Head!
Plus rats!
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.
"I grabbed the thing and ran up to the roof, punt it, and I shank it wide-left."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
"She won't just be my victim,"
"She'll be his victim, too."
"Pretty good, right?"
"That'll kill him, won't it?"
Good man like devalos.
Respected man.
No way he'll be able to live with himself
If he let's that happen.
"I know who you are, you know."
Pardon me?
I know you're a prince.
I know about the problem.
"I know about the money, and I want to help you."
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.
"But I know it's not much, but it's what I've got."
And when you get all that money
"That you've been writing to people about,"
You can pay me back.
I just want enough
To cover my library debt: $92.18.
"I think you are mistaken, little girl."
You've got me mixed up with somebody.
You don't have to pretend with me.
"I know you're a prince, okay?"
I've read the e-mails.
"And I know that you have enemies everywhere,"
But I'm not one of them.
"And look, even if you don't get all your money back,"
I want you to have this.
"I'm sorry, young lady, but you've got me mixed up."
I must get going.
"No, you can't just not take my money"
Mrs Lightman!
Mrs Lightman!
Father Brown.
From the party.
Did you see Henry?
I didn't get to see him.
The police stopped me.
But you knew he'd been poisoned?
Two policemen woke me up this morning asking me if I'd been near his shed.
You must have been very angry with Henry last night.
Why on earth would I want to poison him?
"He can't help me clear Thomas if he's dead, can he?"
No.
You mentioned being in prison?
"On the morning they hanged Thomas, I attacked a policeman."
Oh.
"No, well,"
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to understand.
"Look, all I know about Henry Lee, all I care about, is that he was the last person to look into my son's eyes."
"Morning, Constable."
Father.
Shame to throw away such a handsome volume.
"""For Henry,"
"""the greatest of hangmen, the greatest of men."
"Ever, Max."""
You didn't know that your friend Max was Vera Blanchett's killer until Iris told you last night.
You came home and threw away his gift in disgust.
"Henry, I am only trying to get to the bottom of this."
Max was a senior judge...
..at the Crown Court where Vera Blanchett was a secretary.
He took his own life... ..not long after I hanged Thomas.
Now I know why.
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
"Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?"
"Please, I want to talk to you."
"Michael, I hated you for so many years."
"I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know"
that I could hurt you.
"You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was."
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
"He's so sweet, and helpless without you."
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
"Tom, sit down."
"Our friend and business partner, Hyman Roth, is in the news."
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there.
"His passport's been invalidated, except to return here."
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
"Not for a million, not for ten million."
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
Not much left of him.
It's gonna take 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
Harry?
Kalim intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kalim, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone was trying to muscle out Freddie but Freddie wasn't listening.
Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Kayleigh's murder was so precise - no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
Freddie Lau's body is just dumped in an alleyway.
It's sloppy.
Check out the CCTV in Soho the night Freddie died.
We might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry."
It's my down time.
- Ah!
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your new personal trainer.
Ah-ah!
"The tall guy the other night in the casino, the one that got chucked out - what's his name?"
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just a warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
"All right, stop."
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff but he got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
"♪ Suddenly, I'm up on top of the world ♪"
"What the... ""A Daughter and Her Hero!""?"

"For the record, it is none of your business who my hero is."

"I take it back, okay?"
I take back every single word I wrote.
You think you can just take it back like a bathing suit you've worn three times with the tags tucked in?
No way.
I'm your hero.
No!
Our history together will show
I think you're the absolute worst.
"But now I'll forever know how you really feel about me, which is, ""Everything my mother does comes from her heart."""
Stop using my words against me.
You are not my hero.
I read a document that says otherwise.
"God, you ruin everything!"
"And yet I'm your ""beacon on the hill."""
I resent you so much right now.
"But yet you love me ""more than anyone."""
"This is ""my worst nightmare."""

The polar winter.
This is the planet at its most hostile.
Those that stay here at this time must face the harshest conditions on Earth.
The High Arctic in late autumn.
Empty and abandoned to ice and snow.
Most animals migrated south weeks ago.
"The few that stay will face violent winds, plunging temperatures and months of darkness."
A female polar bear searches for shelter.
"Other bears are out on the frozen ocean looking for food, but she won't feed again until next spring."
"Using as little energy as possible, she starts to dig a shallow nest."
The snow here is easy to work.
It's soft and light.
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
Do say?
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
"Yeah, it's me."
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
She has a head contusion.
She needs medical care.
"Then admit her upstairs to the medical jail ward, but her husband has a knife wound, and she's under arrest."
Mom?
Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
What is happening?
"Tammy, it's okay."
She's traumatized enough.
"Cooper, get her out of here."
No!
I want to stay with mom!
"No, no, no."
"Tammy, Tammy..."
"Everything's okay, sweetie."
I love you.
Mom!
"I love you, sweetie."
I love you.
Tammy.
You want me to give up a hospital bed for a kid with a broken arm?
"She's 11 years old, her dad hit her, she just watched her mom get hauled off by the cops."
"All good material for a country song, but lousy on a medical report."
"You look like day-old dishwater, Coop."
"Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest?"
You've done all you can here.
"No, she's my patient, and I should've known what was going on."
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to Violet's to get your stuff?
"Oh, Charlotte, come on."
Have you talked to her?
"This is not about Violet, okay?"
"I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled, but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine."
What?
"No, well... just think about it when you're bored."
You came?
Yes.
Na Na is here.
Na Na?
I heard from ahjumma... that President Choi Eung Chan is Lee Yoon Sung's real father.
The person who raised you... he's too cruel.
He took you away from ahjumma.
"Intheend,itwastomakeyourrealfatherlikethisright?"
"Because of Lee Yoon Sung's revenge, everything..."
Lee Kyung Wan.
Seo Yong Hak.
Kim Jong Shik.
Cheon Jae Man.
They were all corrupt.
"If they were not corrupt, I would have forgiven them."
"If the President is corrupt, too, are you going to punish him?"
"If he is corrupt,"
That-- does it have to be you who does it?
He's your father.
"To your real father, how can you..."
Kim Young Joo was faced with the same.
"Because it was his father, he concealed and covered it."
"But, was that really good for his father?"
I'm the President's bodyguard.
Maybe...
"like when I was guarding Seo Yong Hak, we might meet like that again."
"I hope, that you won't do anything you will regret."
"You know Assemblyman Lee Young Taek, who is the highest council member of Segyere Party, right?"
Lee Young Taek?
"The prosecution is investigating him on a bribery charge linked to Haewon's Cheon Jae Man for the privatization of health-care, right?"
Yeah.
"Of course, the liver."
"Come on, boys, belly up."
Toast to us.
"Uh, derek and tommy, I'm gonna pour you guys a little shot of ginger ale since you're girly boys who can't handle your booze."
"To us, gents."
"To, uh, garbage bags full of cash."
To liver cancer.
- Here.
- Cheers.Bam.
"Let's go, boys.The strippers aren't going to shove dollar bills between their own jugs."
"You know, you guys go ahead.I'm gonna stay and, you know, close up shop, take care of the money."
"No, it's ok, I got it."
Don't worry about it.
"No, no, it's fine."
I got like a place where I hide it.
"It's very secretive, you know."
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna keep it at lou's place."
So it's not a big thing.
"All right, but I know how to retain it and everything.It's my job."
"- You know what I mean, it's my job."
- It's not your job tonight.
I got it.
Ok?
- You got it?
- I just said I got it.
Ok.
"All right, you got it."
You guys go ahead.
Have a good time at scores.
All right?
"And, you know, I can give you guys a couple of tips that will actually help you guys out there."
But he didn't hang up the phone.
We had to scrub the audio.
"At first, it was quite feint."
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
"You came back, and you put the jacket in ms murnane's laundry."
1:16 pm.
Resuming interview with eva gundelach.
"Now, eva, I'm going to read back over what you said before lunch about the death of thom murnane."
Do you understand?
"Anything I say that is in correct, please stop me and tell me."
"You said,"
"""it happened the night mum and dad fought."
"They'd fought before, but this time was different."
It was loud and I went to listen.
I heard mum saying she wanted to leave dad.
I'm not going to tell you who it was!
"Ok, you promise me you won't say."
Tell me who it was.
It was Jess.
Jess?
Jess murnane?
You said you wanted to know.
"""I couldn't let mum and dad break up."
Couldn't let Jess murnane ruin our family.
I had to make her leave the street.
She wouldn't stay without her boy.
""" If Jess didn't have thom anymore, she'd go, and leave dad alone."
"""I waited till dad got home."
He went to the door and he came back home.
He came back inside and I waited for him to go to bed.
- Any checkpoint in the world.
It routes to a dummy U.S. government site.
No one here will know she left the country.
You match the stamps?
And the crease on the Morocco page and the coffee stain on the German stamp.
Trust me--I've done one or two of these before.
And this needs to be better.
"As long as she has that passport with her, she'll be fine."
That's all I need to know.
Good luck.
Hola Victor.
¿Como estas?
Gracias.
"All that money, and you could only afford two wheels?"
"Well, you're welcome to take a cab if you'd prefer."
♪
"Annie, do me a favor-- toss me your passport."
"Oh, that's okay."
I can hold on to it.
This isn't America.
You don't leave something that valuable just lying around.
What's the matter?
"You weren't planning on running away, were you?"
Yeah.
I was hoping I'd meet a strapping young habanero and start a family down here.
"Well, until then, you'll have to make do with me."

Rescue Me Season 5 Episode 08
I love you.
I always loved you.
I-I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
"Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you."
Okay!
Okay...
"Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?"
I'll admit that.
Yeah.
Nice.
"See, my-my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money."
So the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
"Coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class."
That totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
"So we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired."
So you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
"Yeah, but that's all we did, okay?"
We had nothing to do the murder.
"Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did."
'Cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
Where were you Thursday night?
"I was at, uh, school."
I was at a basketball game.
Got somebody who can vouch for that?
"yeah, yeah."
"My, my-my, my Dad."
He picked me up around 10:00.
What's his name?
Alex Sheridan.
He works at the Manhattan Superior Court.
He's a court officer.
"He was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe."
"It wasn't the son, it was the father."
Court officers have metal batons.
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace.
It's on me.
You don't have to do that.
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.
Then I'd like to go to Chateau Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.
I'll look it up in Daggit and book the Concorde.
I got to go.
I got to get ready.
"Wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event."
Do I look like I'm ready to make my way in the world?
"If all else fails, you can marry rich."
I love that we always have that option.
What'll you do with your hair?
I got the curling iron warming up.
"Mom, the cap."
"You put it on, it's gonna smoosh the curls down."
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.
"Try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or someone."
I'll try.
"- I told her, 'Look, missy... '"
- You called your advisor 'missy?

It was attitudinal.
"I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus from Henemen."
I'm going with Branch.
"'Branch is a graduate of MIT, and Henemen went to Berkeley."
"'He may have majored in Math, but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?"
-I think he means....
-I know what he means.
The answer's no.
"It's a man, okay."
His name's Derek.
He works in the library.
He's been so kind and helpful to me... with my reading... and opening my mind to all sorts of new possibilities.
"We both know it, Stephen, I failed."
"As a wife, as a mother."
"And, right now, I just badly need a change of direction in my life."
"The truth of it is, so do you."
"For God's sake, you deserve better than me, you deserve...."
I'm sorry.
"Look, perhaps it's best if we just...."
"Sorry, Gil."
-Have you got a minute?
-Hi.
"Actually, you know, I was just off to location."
Is it important?
My mother has left all her money to you.
-You're saying she changed her will?
-Two weeks before she died.
Had it all properly redrafted and witnessed at the home.
Without saying a word to you guys?
"I'm sorry, I'm very confused here."
"As are we all, Gil."
"That my mother-in-law in what has been legally confirmed as a ""sound state of mind"""

"""To Mr Gil Raymond, of 1 5 Carpenters Lane, Larch End,"
"""for picking up my spoon."""
"God, that's...."
"You know, it's still too soon to really know how you feel."
Let's give it another day.
I want you to quit.
"Let's be super, super sure."
"(Man over PA) Frankie, you have a call on line one."
Sue wants you to quit.
It was settled then.
I was just gonna have to quit.
Why do I have to quit?
Just 'cause Sue has stupid crazy eyes?
Maybe I don't wanna quit.
So don't quit.
"Yeah, sure."
Right.
"I won't quit, and then I'll be the worst mother in the world."
Ohh!
"You know, it's not fair."
"I'm really loving it, Mike."
"The people there are so nice to me, and I get to wear these pretty costumes, and they bring me tea."
Nothing has made me this happy in years.
No offense taken.
(Sighs) And they like my voice.
"The last time I sang in the car, the kids threw cheetos at me."
Wow.
Must have really hated it to give up cheetos.
Ohh.
Why do I always have to make the sacrifice just 'cause I'm the mom?
"Frankie, you work hard."
"If you've found something that makes you happy, you should stick with it."
"I know, right?"
And she's not a kid anymore.
"If Sue's upset, well, that's life."
You're right about that.
Uh...
Hey.
How 'bout this?
Kramden's Delicious Marshall.
"What's the matter with you, are you a nut or something?"
"""Kramden's Delicious Marshall""!"
"What kind of stuff is ""Marshall""?"
"Well, we don't know what this stuff is!"
"You might as well call it ""Marshall""!"
"Look, I told you I was gonna give you a job, and if you're with me, you're gonna have a job for a lifetime."
I've said that time and time again.
"Now that we've got a winning solution to our problems,"
I'm still going to give you the job.
But you're not gonna be in the advertising department.
This takes a simple little thing like a combination of names.
Krammar's!
Krammar's what?
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer.
Now you got it.
"Now you got ""Krammar's Mystery Delicious..."""
"No, ""Delicious Mystery Appetizer."
"-""Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer."""
-That's it.
That's a catchy...
"Oh, boy."
"You got it there, Ralph."
- That's beautiful.
Let me tell you!
-(chuckles)
"You've bet on many a venture that's failed and flunked and everything but this one, I think you're gonna hit it,"
"I think you're gonna make a fortune and, pal 0' mine, you deserve it!"
"And now, you may spend the rest of your trip enjoying the island."
"Please feel free to make Eden into your own, personal Sandals."
Yes.
"And now, jet skis!"
"Yes, yes!"
Yes!
"Hey, hey, what's happening?"
I sure miss you guys.
I miss you so much.
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!
We get to eat all the candy we want!
"Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!"
Come on!
We're waiting on you!
Give us one second with the kids.
We'll be there in a minute.
Go ahead and start.
"Well, listen, when we get back next weekend, we'll go to Medieval Times and we'll get some big drumsticks and lots of meat."
- Yes!
"And we're gonna be doing a lot more of that fun stuff, guys, so get ready, okay?"
"I'm gonna take you to the school parking lot, we'll do some donuts."
Yeah!
Donuts!
"All right, I love you."
"Love you, too."
Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.
All right.
Enjoy your last few days.
"Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor and not give them candy every time they ask?"
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store returning some of the stuff that you had on that house list.
"Okay, thanks so much."
What?
With the money from this.
My girlfriend needs bigger boobs.
It's the first thing I'm buyin'.
What about you?
I like my boobs.
"So your girlfriend just straight up said, honey, buy me boobs?"
"Naw, she didn't know about it, but she's mad at me, so,"
I'm gonna surprise her.
"Hey, turn around for a sec."
Where'd you get your boobs?
"Yours are real, huh?"
Nice.
"Riley, if you don't stop looking at my boobs,"
"I will uppercut your dick,"
I swear to God.
That would hurt.
Is everything okay?
"Yeah, Riley's just telling me about how he's buying new boobs for his girlfriend."
"What, is she mad at you or something, Riley?"
Yeah.
She mad at me 'cause I wanna go to Mars.
This just keeps gettin' better and better.
Wait.
You were serious?
"Yeah, and I signed up on a program, where you can win a one-way trip to Mars."
I think it's like a nine-month ride in space.
"And she don't understand why I wanna do it, but I'm like, come on, man."
It's Mars.
"Like, I could be the Magellan of space."
"I mean, I might not actually be Magellan."
I'm sure I'd be like his first mate or somethin'.

"Now, here's the deal."
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.
Got that?
Three days.
"Now, listen, this is important."
"Michael, anything."
What can I do?
Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand.
I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
"Jesus Christ, Mike."
"Jesus Christ, let's get them all."
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid.
We had to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
"He taught me, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. """
"If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good."
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.
-Yeah?
"Flynn, are you all right?"
"Yeah, I'm great."
- What are you doing here?
- My counselor brought me.
Your boss said you had an accident.
Yeah.
Your story checks out.
"Well, I'm sorry for the security measures."
Are you comfortable?
Give me what I want and I don't give a damn where you hold me.
"You fought against the Hunters, but now you want to join them?"
The humans took me away from my mother.
They took my baby.
"They used me, made me fight against the Hunters."
I want to be with my own kind.
I think I believe that.
So Liana's coming for me?
Not quite yet.
"First time I shot up, I was 16."
I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard.
"In the parking lot of a 7-11 in Davenport, Texas,"
I bought a dime bag from a dealer named Shotgun Vallardo.
One taste and I was hooked.
So you were a junkie.
Is that supposed to impress me?
"Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk."
I was hooked on the deal.
Next day I was running for Shotgun.
"And six months later,"
Shotgun's wife was a widow and I had every last one of his buyers in my pocket.
"See, we're the same under the skin, you, me, all us Hunters."
We have the same animal urges.
-I can take care of him.
This is our house!
This is your gift for me on our wedding.
"You know, we have a privacy here."
It's near my workplace so I can check up on you during my break.
Raya also promised that she'll look after you when I'm on duty.
"Migs, you're my husband."
I will serve you.
I'll do everything for your memory to come back.
"Migs, I need you."
I want to go home.
When are you taking me home?
You don't have to do this.
I'm your wife.
"I love you so much, Migs."
It'll just worsen the situation.
He thinks you are his girlfriend.
"Ara, I'm scared."
But I'm scared of giving my whole heart again.
"Knowing that one day, his memory will come back."
Joy is his wife.
But you're the one he loves right now.
I badly want to love him even if I know it's wrong.
But it's hard to get hurt.
Will you get my bag please?
It really has a different appeal.
Daddy's so proud of her because...
So that's why you dad was in a Hummer when I saw him in Toronto.
What are you doing there?
.
It's work.
I have an exhibit to stage for my client next week.
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band and rides a motorcycle without a helmet and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh... enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and... he can never..."
ever be true to one woman.
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
Why would we care how...
Usually it's like this.
After you.
"Aw, thank you."
"On the house, Robin!"
♪ Take this bagel on the house
♪ Have a paper on the house
♪ I'd give you a house on the house ♪

Mmm.
Wow.
"Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?"
♪ She's exaggerating

But today was different.
That'll be $3.75.
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
Okay. $7.50.
"Oh, honey-sweetie-baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
"When a woman puts on an engagement ring, it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring in The Hobbit."
"Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?"
Sure.
"He's kind of weird, but he's quiet and always comes through with his half of the rent."
"But now, where were we?"
"Ah, yes, cloning."
Wait a second.
What do you want with me if it's the Tick you're after?
Don't you know anything?
You're the sidekick.
"I clone you, then send the evil clone to procure a tissue sample of the Tick, so I can clone a million of him."
"And speaking of tissue samples,"
I need to get one from you.
[Whimpers] You don't want to do that.
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, I do."
Now hold still.
"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"
Cloning is a precise science.
That's why I use the Clonerizer.
"It costs more, but you get what you pay for."
My own recipe includes a generous portion of Dr. Flack's secret cloning sauce.
"A pinch of oregano, 'cause, you know, a little goes a long way."
"And last, but not least, your toenail."
"Mix well, and... voilà."
"Arthur the Sidekick, prepare to meet Arthur the Evil Clone."
I Arthur.
I Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur, I Arthur."
"I Arthur, I Arth-ur."
I-I-I Arthur-Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur."
"[Chuckles] He's an eager little bunny, isn't he?"
They're a bit excitable at first.
[Gasps] No!
-Lost?
One of our officers was forced to shoot Batman.
And the Boy Wonder has become one of Gotham City's ten most wanted men.
Boys.
Is he there hiding out?
"No, I'm afraid not, sir."
But-
- But isn't it possible that a mistake has been made?
No mistake was made.
Why?
"Well, it's a long and rather involved story, sir."
"You see, earlier today, Batman activated the Batcomputer via his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Remote control?
"I took the liberty of getting some information from the, uh, Batcomputer myself."
"Batman activated the computer from, uh, ""411 Larva Drive."""
-411 Larva Drive.
-Larva Drive.
Sounds like a good place for Black Widow's hideout.
Thank you.
We'll get on it right away.
"Get some men and some squad cars, and let's go."
"I'm back, boys."
"Well, now, after a brief encounter with the law and a quick change in the lady's lounge-- Oh, Grandpa's back too on the porch."
Guess what I have in this tiny little bag.
- More stolen money?
-What else?
"Oh, Batman, you were out of this world."
"And, of course, I was adorable as baby Boy Wonder."
Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too.
"You bet I am, Batman."
Let's get them.
"Now, what did I do with that silly short circuiting device?"
Easy!
"I was in... the apartment, all alone, Henry."
I...
I didn't know what to do.
C'mon!
Give me your shoe!
That's it!
"- I'm sorry, Henry."
"- Okay, you'll just stay here then, c'mon, c'mon."
"- Oh, Henry!"
"- Yeah, that's good!"
- I love Rose.
- I know.
I...
"I love the OLD Rose, the one with no makeup, and baggy clothes, who loves the perfect bite."
"I love her, it's real."
It's not based on passion... although I feel that.
Or lust... although...
I feel THAT.
"Or... or even physical attraction, because she wasn't... although I..."
I thought she was quite beautiful.
"Her eyes, her mouth, the way she held herself, the way she made fun of herself."
"She eats carrots now, isn't that tragic?"
What am I going to do?
Do you know that in the last two years I've been with 11 different women?
"Most of them half my age, not one with a sense of humor I understood."
"Now, I don't date these girls because they're well read."
"I gave one a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"", she thought it was a diet book."
- Can I help you?
"- Yes, I want to see a Miss Morgan."
"It's kind of late to be visiting people, don't you think?"
"Please, just ring her apartment."
What the hell are we watching?
Meerkats.
These meerkats are wearing no clothes.
"Give me the clicker, now!"
"OK, fine, but no cooking programs."
Give me the clicker.
She was just scared.
I'm pretty frightening.
"He hated me, Kitty."
Is that what you think?
I could see it.
Always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you.
"Until all you do is disappoint him again and again, but he disappointed me, too."
He loved you with all of his heart.
"They have to love you, it's their job."
"He just didn't know how to show it, to anyone."
"Well, he showed you."
"And yesterday, he showed me what he thought of me."
Now he's dead...and I...
"You know, after you enlisted, he used to call me every day."
"You know, just to talk."
And you know what he used to talk about?
Justin stories.
Great ones.
"He told me that out of all of his children, you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was."
You were the only one who could do that.
Hmmm...he was so proud of you.
"C'mon, at age 60, you taught him to surf."
He wasn't very good.
"Because of you, he was the only 70 year-old who appreciated ""Death Cab..."
"Curdle."""
Death Cab for Cutie.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
Oh!
- Jake?
- Amy--
It's so good to see you.
- Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"- My dad died, and--"
"- Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Quick follow-up: did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"- All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
- What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"- All right, then stand up."
- Easy.
I love standing up.
"- Yeah, you're staying here."
"- Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
- That's not happening.
Luke?
Um...
I don't know really.
I know.
"Fifth grade, when you two got your mack on, during our class trip, to the Museum of Tolerance back of the bus."
Classy lady.
You know what?
"What's your problem, Cohen?"
"I mean, what did I ever do to you?"
"Nothing, Marissa."
I've lived next door to you forever and you've never done or said anything to me.
"Oh, my God, you're the one who never talks to me."
You think you're so much better than everyone.
I do?
"Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest!"
"Hmm, he plays water polo."
We know--half the team tried to kill us the other night.
"I'm not too popular around here, and your boyfriend--a little bit angry."
You're telling me you didn't try to hit him back?
"Actually, I hit him first."
"Well, hard to believe you're not more popular."
I thought this could be your room.
I still don't know if it's a good idea for me to stick around or not.
You should stay.
Okay... for a little while.
"So when she says it, you listen?"
Hey Summer!
"Oh, hey, hey, hey."
Is that Summer?
Tell her I said happy birthday.
"Coop, where are you?"
We're coming to get you.

This place is really extraordinary.
How could there be such a place like this?
It's pretty enough to make me faint.
Then come again.
"People of Urk believe that if they take the pebbles from this beach, they will be able to come back here for sure."
Here.
"You just lied, didn't you."
"If what you said were true, you think there will still be pebbles left here?"
They would have been all gone.
The people who came back must have put the pebbles back to their rightful place.
"Good day, cornele."
Nice day for erie.
"Look here, drew, who's that new broker you got?"
What?
You don't know who that is?
That's jim fisk.
Fisk?
"Oh, the fella that taught you to suck eggs, drew."
So you've taken him into camp.
"As soon as you get these recorded, come over to the office."
Have you got a big pocket?
I want to put new york in it.
"Oh, hello, commodore."
Too late to buy erie today.
You better come back tomorrow.
"How much you got to sell, fisk?"
All you want.
We aim to please.
Nothing stingy about the erie.
How much?
"1 million, 2 million, 3 million."
As far as you want to go.
That's all i want to know.
"Good evening, hannah."
Good evening.
Was there a printer here with a big poster?
"No, sir, mr."
Fisk.
"Well, i told him to send a sample copy of the show bill here as soon as it came off the press."
"It's got a picture of you on it, big as life and twice as natural."
And it won't be a week before everybody in new york will know who you are.
"I'm going to hang those posters all the way from the battery up to the end of new york, clean up to 34th street."
Why won't you give him the money?
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy""?"
I don't see how that would....
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.
I guess it would be better just to put me in jail and forget about your five-year-old son.
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
Everything's real cool.
"Ray, where are you calling from?"
What's the name of the gas station?
"Ray, you missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
You turn right at this place called Cothern's Bait Shop.
There's a little road there.
"You're not far, baby."
Just about ten minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
"Is that the road, Byron?"
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?
"When they arrive, get them in the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, talk to them."
Let them see everything is okay.
Then stay in the kitchen until I say to come out.
"Then if they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
Then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
Is that the road you took?
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out.
You got me?
I think he's going to quit his job.
"I'm sorry, Maggie."
I gotta go stop him.
(INAUDIBLE)
"Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay."
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
I've got things under control.
You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.
"Oh, Teddy."
I know a little something about man magnets.
"You see, your friend may be one of those magnets that can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge, but I'm one of those magnets that can pick up cars in a junkyard."
- Who's this?
"- Robin, this is Jim, a good friend of mine from work."
"Oh, well, hello there. (GIGGLES)"
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, boy."
"What does being ""ready"" even mean?"
"I mean, I thought I was ""ready"" last year."
I wound up getting left at the altar.
"I'll be honest, guys."
I'm a little scared.
"Okay, Louis, then Betty."
"We're all scared, Professor Mosby."
Doesn't being scared let you know you're on to something important?
Yeah.
"I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance."
"And if you're not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing?"
Right?
"I think you're ready, bro."
Need your vote now.
"Oh, my God, that was so fun."
"Thought you said no one says ""blog"" anymore, huh?"
"Bye, Fred."
"Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty."
Oil painting by Tom Freeman to commemorate the burning of the White House by the British in 1814.
"- Wait, the White House burned down?"
"- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812."
Practically had to be rebuilt from the ground up.
"When I look at this painting, I get very emotional."
John.
I think I need to avail myself of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.
There's a ladies' room downstairs.
- Where?
I'll take her.
"- I can go by myself, John."
I'm not a child.
"Hey, just don't touch anything or wander off or talk to anybody that you shouldn't be talking to."
I make no promises.
He's seven minutes behind.
"Sorry, he got hung up on the State Floor."
"- Good morning, Margaret."
"- Morning, Mr. President."
Could you get the speaker on the phone?
"Right away, sir."
Have you and the missus zeroed in on a dining establishment?
When have you known the missus to zero in on anything?
"Fair point, sir."
"Martin, I wanna shake your hand."
- We're all sorry to see you go.
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"And I know that you and Muriel have had a tough go of it since Kevin passed, and..."
"When you run out of the truth, what are you gonna say then?"
"Nothing, nothing at all."
"You just keep repeating that, Mrs. Slocum."
It could mean a whole lot to your future.
[door opens] [door closes]

[clucking tongue]
"Thanks, honey, I don't mind if I do."
"Say, where's your mother anyway, it's almost dinner time."
"Well, she can't be out much longer."
"As soon as the stores close, she's got to come home."
What a good girl you are.
Always waiting for your mother.
"Like the other night, for instance."
It was real nice of you to wait till she got home.
"What time was it, anyway?"
She got in around 2:00 a.m.
You're sure 'cause you were up?
"No, I'm not sure."
Then how can you be sure?
I'm not.
It's just that she said she got in then.
Then you wouldn't know if she went out again.
"Really, Mrs. Armstedder."
Why don't you stick to solitaire?
"Janie, what do you think?"
A lady at the hairdresser's asked me for my autograph... and the man at the corner said I ought to sell my story to the Chronicle.
"Are you still here, Blanche?"
"Well, Jane asked me to dinner."
"Say, you've got a new hairdo."
"Well, looks pretty nice."
"Excuse me, you've got a tag here."
I can't get it.
Where the fuck is my eyelash collar?
I get so mad.
These stupid people...
Here it is!
We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...
I think maybe we should get back out there.
We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.
I'm gonna sew you out.
It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.
I just walked off.
"I don't feel well, Paul."
I just wanna go home and cuddle off with you.
"Okay, I'II..."
- I'm gonna get your car.
- You're so sweet to me.
- I had a great time the other day.
- Me too!
I loved working with you at the shoot.
And I think we make great walking partners
- We should consider the marathon.
"- Listen, Jocelyn..."
I think you are amazing... and I loved... that walk with you as well... and I loved hanging out with you on the shoot... and God only knows I'm always so happy when I see your face...
I think we make great friends...
But...
Resin is a little pissed off because that I see so much of you... and I realized that...
I just hope I wasn't giving you the wrong idea.
No.
But it really doesn't matter because I like me.
"Well, I don't like you."
Whatever.
I love you.
I can't stand picking out tiles.
It drives me nuts to try to redo the fricking house.
I know it does.
"But, you know, the one thing that we can and should always do is just kind of have fun with each other."
"And truthfully, sweetheart, that should be the easiest thing to do because before there was the kids or the house or the job or any of it, there was just you."
"And I love you, Ronnie."
"I love you, too, Dave."
"Hey, now, all you naughty boys and girls, gather 'round, gather 'round."
The hell's she doing here?
Who?
That's my wife.
She must be looking for me.
I don't think so.
She looks fine.
You should just relax.
Son of a...
Excuse me!
Hey!
Peacock!
"Please, I don't want to hurt you."
"""Encouragement!"" Joey!"
"Baby, remember when we first met and I told you that you were the only man I'd ever been with?"
You lied?
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was...
"I was completely inexperienced, and, honey, I didn't know what I had in you."
I've been cheating on you!
I've been cheating on you every chance I got!

Oh!
Oh!
Aah!
It's in my finger.
hen was small had a desk.
"t was weird because wrote on it ""hen grow up wanna be a singer. """
lik e scribed it in.
And it's still on the desk.
Life at home was my dad mom and my three sisters.
You could say had a heavy woman influence  from a young age.
e lived in a tiny house.
used to have a little bed in my mum and dad's room.
used to sit on the windowsill and imagine things lik e winning the lottery.
hen was little knew that wanted to entertain people.
was a proper show-off.
At school was always trying to play the class clown.
've always been that guy that made people laugh.
used to get kick ed out of class for singing rish traditional songs at the back of geography.
could always hear my sister's music at the top of the stairs and used to pretend to have a guitar and 'd perform in my mirror in my bedroom.
wasn't really interested  in things that other kids were interested in.
No kid of mine is going to hand me any lip!
I didn't sweat half my life in a steel box to come out and get this from you!
You're Joe!
"Joe Krozac, jr., Understand?"
And you and I are going back to that dame -your mother-
"She'll tell you that I'm your father from first to last, understand ?"
- Yes.
- You gonna behave ?
Sure.
"Sure, I am."
Come on.
We got to get out of this.
Dig in under.
That's what you do with a haystack.
Did you leave any money for the eggs?
"Boy, you sure got funny ideas."
But you and I are going to get along all right.
We won't have any more beefs on each other.
I hope not.
'Cause you got brains.
"You know, I like brains around me."
"Your angle on digging last night, you know?"
"And this fire, with the poles and everything-"
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?
From dads.
"You see, he taught me all about camping out like this."
"You see, we went on a camp hike last month-"
"Come on, come on."
Let's get moving.
- We had a race to see who could-
"- Come on, come on."
"catch the most fish, and he caught 20 bass and pickerel, and that only made-"
- He's all right.
We'll run him through the wringer.
He'll wash.
- How was the ball game?
- We beat the daylights out of them.
"- You did, eh?"
What was the score?
- Sixty-three to 40.
But we only played five innings.
Fat hit a homer and we lost the ball.
And you've torn your pants again.
"Well, I was sliding into third and Muggy spiked me."
"Yeah, what did you do to him?"
I smacked him.
"You know, when I was his age, I could lick any kid in the neighborhood."
- Ouch.
- What's the matter?
- That's where he smacked me back.
That's all there is.
The fellows think I'm gonna get the job.
And I...
"Well, I'm the best man in the shop, ain't I?"
"Gee, Pop, you'll be foreman and that's about the highest job there is, ain't it?"
Heh-heh-heh.
"Well, I wouldn't say that but it's pretty high."
"Well, wait till I tell Muggy about this."
He thinks he's hot because his uncle used to be a foreman.
"Yeah, we'll get Muggy, won't we?"
"- Come on, boys, dinner's ready."
Okay.
"And if I'd have known about this, I'd have fixed us a real spread."
"Oh, don't you worry, kid."
"Well, we couldn't stand by and see you suffer for speaking your mind."
Mrs Cameron's loss is very much our gain.
"You're very welcome here, Claire."
I can't thank you enough.
- You just have.

"You're thinking about Joyce, aren't you?"
I can practically hear the pistons of frustration pounding in your head.
I'm not wasting any more mental energy on that woman.
But I am thinking about how we might resurrect the Institute.
Might not mothballing be for the best for the time being?
Given that everyone's looking inwards now.
- What way was it?
Stuart had always been crazy jealous.
"That night, he was drunk too."
He started hitting me and jabbing a gun into me.
"He was mad enough to kill me, and I was terrified."
"Suddenly, Johnny came into the room."
He'd f ollowed us home f rom the club.
"He took the gun f rom Stuart, or was trying to but it seemed to go off right in my ear."
I passed out and when I came to Johnny was kissing me.
"That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago."
I remember he said goodbye.
I think he was crying.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter."
Let's get out of this lobster trap.
We need salt air.
They say salt's antiseptic.
"Rip, what's the matter?"
is something the matter?
- Yesterday you called me Dusty.
Today--
- Johnny used to call you that.
Yes.
What would you like to call me?
- l'll have to think about that.
"- Yes, think of that."
- l want you to.
- We'd better get back to town.
I couldn't stand there looking at her. I had to keep moving.
Her story about Johnny sounded real.
"I'd buy it, on approval, as the dolls say."
There are other people interested.
You thinking about selling to the Vietnamese?
I'm not gonna say who.
"I gotta do what's best, right?"
"You want my money in your bank, I want that Eastern territory."
"I'm not saying we won't make a deal, but there are other people interested and I wanna listen to what they have to say."
"You sell me the East, I make sure you make a lot of money."
- Keep talking.
- It's all I'm asking.
I got a meeting with this guy in 10 minutes.
- Where is this gonna be?
"- 400 block, Powell."
I'm in my car.
Let's go.
Julianna Vejzna?
Immigration.
"Would you come along with me, please."
- Am I being arrested?
"- Yes, you are."
Why?
Why are you arresting me?
"I'm sorry, I don't know the details."
Watch your head.
The Chickadee club's laid out like this.
"Two exit doors at the back, Ronnie's office, then you got the stage."
"These exits doors are open, or locked up?"
I don't know.
Can I get out that way is what I need to know.
Have they got chains?
I'll see if I can find out.
"This is the club here, all this."
"This is the lounge and your front doors, here and here."
"You know, I've always tried to be there for you."
"I was off making the money, they money that is in that trust fund."
I guess I hoped that you'd be there for me now.
"Well... it's up to you now, isn't it?"
"Excuse me, Amelia?"
Let me guess.
"You want to audition, and you're looking for advice."
"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe lose 20 pounds and sleep with the choreographer."
"Actually, I'm not a dancer."
I'm a journalist.
"I'm from ""Interview"" Magazine."
They told me you were ready to talk to me.
"Wait, you're from ""Interview""?"
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you...
"I mean, you're so young."
"Well, I could say the same thing about you."
I'm 17.
"In this business, that's about a year away from being pushed out."
"And here I was, expecting I would have to talk to some old person."
"Nope, just me."
Cool.
"Look, I want to apologize."
- No need.
- It's just...
It's not what it looks like.
"Oh, it's not?"
Because it looks like you're married.
"Yes, but it's an open marriage."
We both want to be with other people.
Really?
That's not just a lie so you don't look like a snake?
When?
"I mean, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight some of these people will never talk to me.
And what happens next year?
"What, she does this next Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair."
"Well, what else can you do?"
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer and not face the damage she's done.
- Wait.
"That's not true, is it?"
- No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
"Well, here's something new."
"I told Chuck I loved him, again."
"And he didn't say it back, again."
"- Blair, I'm not gonna tell people that."
- I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
- Don't wanna be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school.
- Look what it almost made me do.
- That's the thing.
You need to be cool to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart.
She got her head chopped off.
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
"Keep your eye on the prize, Jenny Humphrey."
"You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you."
For what it's worth you're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
"Essentially, it's like feeding the beast-- this big, ugly, greedy beast that demands to be fed over and over and over again."
Is this your first meeting?
Hi.
"Yeah, actually, it is."
My name's Nick.
I'm Monica.
Hi.
Your words were an inspiration.
Thanks.
"Yeah, she's great, isn't she?"
This is Hillary.
"Hillary, this is Nick."
"Hillary, it's a pleasure."
Hi.
"Listen, if this is your first time, you shouldn't feel pressured to join this group."
There's others in the city you might want to check out.
Hillary's right.
It's really important that you trust the people you're going to be looking to to help you...
And who'd you rather look to for help than Monica?
"You come here to get off drugs, and you meet Monica."
That's a pretty good deal.
I'd marry her tomorrow if she'd give me the word.
"Henry, settle down."
You're going to scare Nick off.
"Well, that's the idea."
Less competition.
"We'll, um, talk later, right?"
Yeah.
I'm his sponsor.
"Look, why don't I take you over to Angie?"
She's got books and pamphlets.
"Nick, it's going to be rough, but we're all here for you, and if you need any help, just call me, okay?"
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"My dad died, and..."
"Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
- Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"All right, then stand up."
Easy.
I love standing up.
"Yeah, you're staying here."
"Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
That's not happening.
"All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that.
"As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,"
"I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance."
"Oh, really?"
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
"Well, I'm not really from Mattel."
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
"Well, sure."
Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
"Hey, a laser!"
"How come you don't have a laser, Woody?"
It's not a laser!
It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.
"All right, that's enough!"
"Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy."
-Toy?
-T-O-Y.
Toy!
"Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger."""
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
"Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?"
"Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious."
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
"He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!"
Carter?
Ben went into the storm drains at first and pierce.
The city doesn't have any cameras down there.
And there are literally thousands of exit points.
"Yeah, Ben knows that."
He's been doing this a while.
This is him.
I'm gonna join you in.
"Listen, Ben barely trusts me so he can't know you're on, okay?"
Understood.
Andy will run a trace.
"Ben, talk to me, man."
I want $2 million.
"Not enough for what I've been through, but it's the most I can carry."
"Ben, you know I can't ask the government for that kind of money."
This is not an official operation.
It's not my problem.
You get me the money or I call bin-Khalid's men.
I took one of their phones at the construction site.
"Please, man, listen, you're strung out"
And you're not thinking straight.
"Eric, I've never been more clear in my life."
Show up at the 7th street metro station with my money in one hour.
An hour?
"Ben, you got to give me more time."
For the government to find me?
"No, you show up on time with the money,"
You get the list.
"If any of those things don't happen, Eric,"
I will sell the list to bin-Khalid's people.
Period.
Ben!
What's the last thing we want?
No panic.
Right.
"Okay, is the tutorial over?"
Let's get in there.
Out of here.
"Beers, is that you?"
"It's Janet Lewis, Beers."
You haven't been answering your phone.
Everything all right?
Beers?
"Oh, my God."
"You're right, that's not Beers."
But it sure looks like him.
He's not anybody anymore.
Looks like a stab wound.
"All right, it's time to shut down the airport."
Not a problem.
We've been unofficially shut down for the last 20 minutes.
No vehicles in or out until this storm ends.
"His gun's gone, Tony."
Great.
"We're snowed in here with an airport full of cranky passengers, a dead fake air marshal, and his killer somewhere on the loose, with a knife and a gun."
"Anybody else feel like they're playing ""Clue""?"
Unbelievable.
"These shots will be coming to you from Jake's phone, McGee."
"We'll send them to Ducky, too."
I think he's gonna be busy for a while.
"""And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast."""
"Yet I'm the one who had to get out and push the van, Shakespeare."
"That was W.C. Fields, Mr. Palmer, in The Fatal Glass of Beer."
And I predict you will be pushing it again on the way back.
"Nah, that's not a bullet wound."
"Damn it, Lyle."
"Yes, it is."
Then where's the bullet?
I haven't found it.
"You don't have a bullet, you don't have a bullet wound."
She could've hit anything falling into the water.
"A rock, a nail-- anything."
But she didn't.
It wasn't suicide.
It was murder.
"Melvin, I'm startin' to worry about ya."
Beautiful dead girl naked under a sheet.
Must have a way of makin' a man think strange.
Sam.
"Don't lose your cool, Sam."
"Melvin, this is nothin' more than an unfortunate case of suicide."
Bury the poor girl.
"If it was suicide, where's the gun?"
She wasn't shot.
I'm the coroner.
I say she was.
"If it was a suicide, the gun is probably in the water near the dock."
Maybe the gun's in the lake.
If she shot herself-- and I don't believe that she did-- then the gun must have fallen into the water.
That lake's near freezing'.
You want me to send a man into that icy water lookin' for a gun that's not even there.
"If the gun is there, then you're right about the suicide."
And then...
I'll bury her.
"Okay, Melvin."
I'll look for the gun.
What are you doing?
"Before it was even time to go home, he was pushing me into the car then pulling me out."
It was ridiculous.
But Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday night.
We agreed.
"Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up."
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
"He really liked you, too."
That's all he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"Tommy, what the fuck?"
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
"Who the hell do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?"
"Slow down, alright."
I forgot. I thought it was next week.
"It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!"
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you were gonna stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
What did you expect?
Let me make it up to you...
Karen.
I'll think about it.
"I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud."
-But she looked good.
That made me so happy.
"I was really, really happy."
That's why I'm here right now.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
I wonder if that person still reads my novels today.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
"I see, so Izumi-sensei, you too..."
"""Sensei""?"
"Oh, n-nothing!"
I knew you wrote novels on the web!
I-I see.
But to think I'd see the day where I could talk to you like this.
"Big Brother, why are you bothering me?"
You should just leave me alone.
I'm just...
Do I trouble you?
T-Trouble...
It's because you're my little sister.
And Mom asked me to take good care of you.
Is that your reason?
I still don't know what counts as taking good care of you.
So I just do things that I feel would count as such.
I don't get it at all.
"Other than that, I'm just lonely, after all."
I'd like to eat meals together with my cute little sister.
"And I want to take care of her, too."
"Even a troublesome little sister like this, who hardly ever talks to you?"
So you were aware of that.
I want us to get along.
Because we're family.
Are we a family?
Of course.
I have to go.
"Yes, come fast, OK."
OK Madam.
"Two minutes more, Sir, He's not our Laxminarayan."
"I told you he's my Laxminarayan, Yes it's your piece and it's yours too."
"""When there is life, there is living"""
Sir i want to check out.
I want to check out please make my bill.
Why Sir you were suppose to leave tomorrow?
"Sir, yeah but i want to go now."
Please make my bill.
"Please make my bill, i want to check out."
Please make it quick.
"My luck is not good, will you change it?"
"What kind of man you are, asking question on questions cheak out please!"
"""When there is life, there is living"""
why you are laughing?
Yeah ma'am?
"Ma'am, Inspector..."
recognize me?
How can i forget you?
You are look changed.
Did you had accident?
"Yeah just like accident, kindly take me with you."
"Oh my duty alarm... when i see you i feel like i should hit the alarm because i am on duty, so i cant even hit the alarm."
Madam?
Did you find him?
I couldn't find Laxmi Narayan.
"You shut up... let's check over there, ok tata, bye, see you."
Did you had Viagra?
And now you cant control it?
"Don't do this, don't play with my feelings."
-Oh boy.
Man I can't believe you're gonna try to solve your problems.
By letting your friends make all the sacrifices for you.
I thought your father and I raised you better than that.
[Scoffs] I didn't make them do anything.
They did it on their own.
Oh yeah.
I'm sure Lilly really wants to give up her opportunity to go to Stanford.
Come on.
It's just for this year.
We'll go together next year.
If she gets in again.
And there's no guarantee that she will and you darn well know that.
[Softly] Keep it down.
They'll hear you.
I'm in your head!
[Loudly] I can talk as loud as I want to!
"[Groaning] All right, all right."
-Jeez!
I'm annoying sometimes.
-Tell me about it.
And what about Jesse?
Do you really think he's happy about being despised.
By millions of people for breaking my heart?
Ha-ha!
You said my heart.
We have the same heart and I know it's not broken.
"What do I have to say to that, huh?"
I'll tell you what I have to say.
If you go on letting your friends do this for you.
Sure they seem okay with it now.
But deep down inside they're going to hate you for it.
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You got to do something about Eddie's pension.
They're going to reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox here at his summer cottage in Ulster County."
Emergency Service Unit workers...
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
They found the money.
Good work.
I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County  but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
- It's full of hornets' nests.
"- Yeah, busy hornets."
"Never in our life did we see $4,000 cash much less 40."
There's only 2 people know that's not Eddie's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't move, motherfucker!"
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!
"For a second I thought I was dead, but when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
Michael!
Lock the door!
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Hey fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't give a fuck."
"25 years, pal, that's what you're gonna do."
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
"Phone taps, surveillance, everything."
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
"You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a fucking problem all night."
Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.
"25 fucking years, pal."
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
"What, were you guys grocery shopping?"
There's Tommy with that bitch Josephine.
She had the same clothes on last weekend.
And she lives in Virum.
I just saw Jonas Engberg and Nik Kragh.
MONEY
"We set the trend for what's ""in""."
If me and my sister are seen in things we bought in New York   everyone wants the same.
You can buy your way out of most illnesses.
You can always go away somewhere for a cure.
I spend my money on on sex and gadgets and drugs and booze.
My friends rate some of my friends rate money higher than happiness.
But I hope -
- I'II be happy.
Then money won't matter.
I use my credit card as a comfort blanket.
If I'm feeling low I feel I deserve that top or that bag.
I haven't found a door I can't open with my money.
Crying in a limo with shaded windows is always more fun   than smiling at the wheel of a Skoda.
- I don't get it.
- Get what?
Anja and Patricia.
"The biggest cock-teasers   with Tommy and Jonas, the biggest shaggers in town."
"- Yes, it's weird."
- I'm getting new rims.
20 inch.
Straight from L.A.
- Cool.
"- I want 22"" Chrome."
- As my graduation present.
"- You can't have 22""if I've got 20""."
- Another line?
- You know I can't take it.
"Mr. Brubaker, I assure you that my father is innocent."
"I... no, he's not in the office, but..."
I'll have him call you.
- I am so happy to see you.
"- Guess who no longer works for Partridge, Savage and Cann?"
- You quit?
- Or got fired.
Quit slash got fired.
Lot of things were said.
- None of them good.
- What happened?
Your father.
"They said as long as I was representing him, I wasn't working for them."
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9:00 p. m.
Cohen!
How did you get in here?
"Your stepmom, who's in unusually good spirits."
- It's the Klonopin.
- That'd explain that eye twitch.
"- Listen, I'm not going to stay long."
"- Actually, you can't stay at all."
"The Valley is on, so you should just..."
"Right, no, I have something for you."
"- Well, unless it's a plutonium -fueled car to take me back to last year so I can never date you, I'm not interested."
"- Oh, okay, it's two tickets to The Walkmen tomorrow night."
"- I'm not going to a concert with you, ass."
"Hey, I'm not going, okay?"
"Well, I am, actually, I'm going, but I'm not going to go with you."
These are for you and Zach.
- Me and Zach?
- Yeah.
I swear.
- They won't get over it.
- Who?
The others down there.
"Father Catolle, Mr Mayor."
"Most of all, those wives of theirs."
It'll kill them!
- And then there's Bertha
- Who's she?
Someone I thought of as queen of the village.
"But now, comparing her to you she's a cow."
"I like you a lot, Goubi."
Do you...
"Do you think the schoolkids will call me ""Mr Goubi""?"
"They'd better, or they'll cop it!"
But then there's the others.
The grown-ups.
They all know I'm an imbecile.
Even if I have a wife and a car I'll always be one.
It's true...
"Once the die is cast, that's it."
And then there's something else.
You're all that I think about.
I can't help it.
"One day, thinking about you too much... is going to make my head explode."
Because of you.
I'm used to people making fun of me.
"But they'll talk about YOU, because of ME and I'd hate that."
You'll have your own land and money in the bank...
So you'll never stop people talking behind your back.
The main thing is that they're silent when you turn around!
So you came to ask me permission to marry La Fleur.
"I said, ""Really?"
"You've seen Cliff 60 times?"""
"He went, ""Yeah, but I saw him when I was 11, and I'm autistic,"
"""so whoever I saw then, I just loved forever."""
"So, even Cliff's biggest fan is explaining away why he's a fan."
LAUGHTER
It's absolutely insane.
Can you tell me about the time you met the Queen?
The Queen?
Yeah.
"Oh, I know what you're after."
Do you remember telling this story?
"When you came on QI, you told this story and it really made me laugh."
"Yes, I did a Royal Variety show and I was..."
"Yeah, that's it."
LAUGHTER
"And, you know, you have to wait for ages in a line, and Her Majesty was proceeding graciously along, and she spent quite a long time talking to Frankie Dettori next to me."
And you know when you are aware that you've got a little bit of wind working its way through?
"And I thought, ""It's nothing to worry about..."
LAUGHTER
""".."
"I'll just deal with this silently."""
LAUGHTER
"And just as the queen got to me, the..."
"It was the moment, you know, where the wind was making a break for it."
"So, I let nature take its course."
"Unfortunately, I shat myself."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
But it wasn't...
"It wasn't a great big, you know..."
Sure.
About six years.
"You get some kind of sick pleasure from that, the boss' daughter?"
"""Boss""?"
I thought we were friends.
I love Mary.
And I think she loves me.
I want your desk cleaned out by tomorrow.
"After this is over, I'll be going back to Maine."
I don't wanna see you there when I go into the office.
How you feeling?
What's happening to me?
"- It's in her DNA, isn't it?"
- That's what makes her special.
Mum...
"I never believed that part of your story-- ""My grandfather was an alien."""
- Allie...
- Your dad--could he do things?
"I never saw it, but, yes, he could."
- But you never could.
- I can play drums and sing harmony.
A lot of people would tell you that's amazing.
There's you and me.
"The way I know where you are, how you're feeling, if you're safe."
I always figured that was just because I'm your only daughter and you love me so much.
"Yeah, I suppose it could be that."
"It's what made your dad sick, isn't it, doing these things?"
"You're not my dad, honey."
You've got a lot of other things in you.
"You've got Charlie's family, too."
MAN:
Everybody in position?
He's not gonna last much longer.
You can have a job here if you work like everyone else.
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, dad."
"I know you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought..."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
"You haven't spoken with me for over a week, since..."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened... make the best of it.
Mother?
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed... pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
-You can't mean that.
-I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison, I was only trying to protect you."
I was an accident that you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What will you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job.
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
"Oh, God..."
"God, help me!"
Allison!
Allison!
I didn't want you to come down here.
I couldn't say good-bye to you.
-You know I don't want you to go.
"Well, I was mistaken."
I've got a pretty good steak knife...
Just try to help.
"You go out the front door, you hook a right."
"Then walk three blocks straight down, its on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
- I'll go Daze.
- Why can't I?
"Because you look 12, and I've an ID."
We might actually checked in this part of town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone, and remember what I said."
Okay.
You guys need anything?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"I'm not supposed to really talk to you anymore, so..."
"Oh, wait!"
I think you got a phone message.
"But that's all I'm sayin', now I'm gonna zip."
You have one new message.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone...
Me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time.
Maybe three years.
What?
-I got it!
"-Hey, ten days!"
"Wait, I can be out of here tomorrow morning, in Chicago, and outside of her dressing..."
"Hey, come on, fellas, I'm a little, you know..."
"-Sarge, I'm tapped out."
"-Me, too."
What a time.
"Men, freeze."
"Freeze, you heroes."
"Men, I may have seemed a little harsh with you."
It's only because I was mad at myself for forgetting to tell you the new thing I thought up for you.
It's only a buck a throw-- my new snack-in-the-sack raffle.
Snack-in-the-sack raffle?
What's that?
Just what it says.
The guy who wins gets his breakfast served in bed for ten days.
"How about it, boys?"
"-But Sarge, we're broke."
"-Busted, not a dime."
It's a miracle how this platoon is always broke at the same...
"Zimmerman, on the double, right here."
"Yeah, but Sarge, you told me..."
Right here.
"Now, Herman, you're not going to take me serious all the time, are you?"
I want this.
I want these deadheads to look at a real live wire.
This boy's not broke all the time.
Why?
"'Cause he's on the hustle, he thinks up things, washes officers' cars at a buck a throw."
He's all right.
(chuckles)
"How much did you make, Herman?"
Daddy?
"Your dad has a broken pelvis, which are the ring of bones around his waist."
Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
He's bleeding inside.
Can you fix it?
"We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already."
It's very serious.
It was supposed to be me.
"I was supposed to go get the pizza, but I-I... didn't want to go out in the rain."
"It's not your fault, and it's not your dad's fault."
"Hey, jerk-off!"
I can't drive for a week.
Not that I could anyway-- my car is totaled.
What was so important you had to be talking on the phone while driving!
Come on!
What was so damn important!
Hey!
That's enough!
"- Hey, get that guy away from me!"
- Shut up!
.
"Jason, hey, I know you're mad, but your father's condition is very serious, and your brother and sister need you right now, okay?"
"Come on, Jason, I'll take you to the Family Room."
"Dr. Kovac, one of your patients is getting agitated."
- Which one?
T- he girl from the nursing home.
"- She's in a coma, Inez."
- Not anymore.
- Where...
- I'm Dr. Kovac.
Wh-Where's my mom?
"Okay, keep your hands up as if you were holding a tray."
We'll find a way.
Just as soon as he has the company making money again.
Wait a minute.
John!
"Oh, hello, my dear."
And Harold.
Nice to see you again.
"How are you, John?"
All I know is what my psychiatrist tells me.
He says you're entirely well.
And it's going to be wonderful to have you home.
"Isn't it, Harold?"
It's the best news I've heard in months.
"Well, all packed, I see."
"You know, I'm beginning to think that you never liked this place."
"It's not so bad after you get used to it, Doc."
But you say I'm all right now and my wife wants me home.
"Well, you take care of yourself."
"I don't want to see you back here again, except as a visitor."
"I'll see that he never comes back, Doctor."
"Shall we go, dear?"
"John, if you'll sign this we'll spring you."
"Anything you say, Warden."
That's a fine way to talk.
"Here, I'll take those."
"Oh, I forgot this."
"Well, I think that's everything."
"Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry."
"Your husband won't be able to go with you just now, after all."
I don't understand.
He is not able to leave here now.
But he's completely sane.
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.
"If anybody was listening, they'd know everything."
"They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her."
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to keep eye on the stove.
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
"You see, I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?"
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that.
Come on.
- You all right?
"- Yeah, sure."
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
- That the last one?
- Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch.
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
- I have to.
- You don't have to.
I got to go home.
"What do you mean, you got to go home?"
I've been carrying this all day.
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
"Would you be disturbed, or would you welcome it?"
Is that a special move I'm not aware of?
"Tell me, does it feel... does it feel tight, is there reverb?"
"Whoa, wow, we, uh, we can come back."
"Oh, no, no, no, I was just trying to see if my butt had changed since college."
"- Well, this is 40."
"- Oh, God."
"- Hi, baby girl, are you hungry?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Dive in.
- Ahh-ooh.
We got some carrots.
"Uh, hey, Mags, might I have a word?"
"Uh, yes, you might."
"Well, it's been approximately six weeks since we took Joanie and Cha-Chi to the carwash."
- Are you talking about sex?
"- Geez, Maggie, the baby..."
What?
"That's how she got here, right?"
"Anyway, since that wonderful night, I've been feeling..."
"Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce, we talked about this, right?"
- It was just the one night.
"- Oh, no, no, it's not that."
"- It's, uh, I met somebody."
"- Oh, okay, good."
"- I mean, that's great, yes."
"- Her name is Nancy, and it's been fast and furious, like the first movie, not the other seven, which I feel don't hold up."
"- Okay, Bruce, focus."
"- Anyhow, um, I really want Charlotte to meet her, but I was that maybe before she meets her that you might meet her."
- I'd love to meet her.
Are you talking about names?
"Fitzwallace, Leo and Ulysses S. Grant."
"Not for nothing, but before we go in there, I wanna be clear."
I didn't have to convince him or even suggest it.
"Right off the bat he said, ""Let's take my name off it."""
- Yeah.
- Leo?
The vice president.
Thanks.
You can go home now.
- I go home when you go home.
- I'll get back to you.
"Mr. Vice President, I like your style."
- It's money well spent.
- It deserved to have your name on it.
I've got my name on other stuff.
You know what I don't like?
I don't like we can't campaign on it.
- Can you sit for a minute?
- Yeah.
"I'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is."
"I'm sorry, I don't."
"I respect the anonymity of an alcoholic, I can't reveal what's said in a meeting but I've got a responsibility to the president, and in fact, to the country."
"Leo, I'm sorry."
I honestly don't know what you're saying.
- You've gotta tell the president.
- Tell him what?
- That you're an alcoholic.
- Are you telling me he doesn't know?
- How would he know?
- You didn't tell him?
Of course I didn't.
I know you got that movie deal.
I know you're starring in it.
Congratulations.
"I'm a nice guy, but I'm also a businessman, and I'm willing to get rid of those tapes, each and every one of them."
"And that's why we're here-- giving you three a chance to repent, forgive yourselves."
"And how do we do that, you snake?"
I think a million dollars will help you heal and cleanse that darkness you've gotta be carrying with you.
Bastard.
You can cover that.
"No, I know how this works."
"- Oh, do you?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Once we pay you, then in three more months, we hear from you again looking for more money to keep quiet."
We were acting in self-defense.
Self-defense?
"Mutilating, chopping up a lifeless body, that's self-defense?"
You three are crazier than I thought.
I made you all an offer.
I keep my word.
What are you gonna do?
911.
What's your emergency?
CHEERING
Tonight on 8 Out of 10 Cats.
"Our Pointless friend, it's Richard Osman!"
"She's having a laugh, it's Ellie Taylor!"
"And their team captain, Rob Beckett!"
And facing them tonight.
"Acting funny, it's Jessica Knappett!"
"Here for the craic, it's David O'Doherty!"
"And their team captain, Aisling Bea!"
"My mother, on the other hand, resisted what she called the sly ways of the place with a fiery, feral determination."
"She dwelt in Moybeg, but she didn't live there."
And it seems she never gave Barnhill's letter to Emma.
Perhaps she felt that a note from beyond the grave was just too much for my sister to bear even as a grown woman.
What's this?
What do you think it is?
Stolen goods.
- Mrs. Coyne.
"- Rose, please."
Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man.
Did you want me to flirt?
My name is Andrew Black.
I'm the doctor's son.
He is REALLY nice.
Bailiffs!
What are you doing?
They've got the flag up.
"Well, they may put it down again."
Blirts!
Jail for our friend.
"I have to tell the truth, Seamie!"
You said that.
OK.
"You guys, he's being very annoying."
"Uh, Shel, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to me immediately afterwards?"
"Oh, no, sweetie."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
"I mean there's still a few girls in Detroit who think they had sex with Cleveland from ""Family Guy."""
Okay.
I want Danny to spend time with my son.
He promised that he would and now he's trying to pull out.
"I can help you, Nick."
I'm here for you.
Who can help your hunger?
"Your craving for the warm, sweet taste of blood."
"You can beat it, Nick."
Surrender!
Yield to your thirst.
[GROWLING]
Gonna fly the coop on us?
SimÃ²n.
"You gonna take care of that business for us, right?"
You brought your brother in.
You gotta take him out.
Santana was gonna talk to J. D.
"Come on, don't punk out on us, ese."
"If you can't take care of it, we will."
Anybody that happens to be with him gets to go along for the ride.
"One-two-three, five!"
"One-two-three, six!"
"One-two-three, seven!"
"Dear Julie, maybe the reason I learned how to read and write was so that I could write you this letter."
"Here in this cage, behind these bars,"
"I can read, I can learn."
"I can even make love, but it's distorted."
"I thought that what I had learned on the inside was everything I needed to know, even on the outside."
"Like they say, things don""t always turn out the way one feels they should."
"Till now, all the books I've ever read have been to try to get power."
J U LI E:
Let's see.
"Mico, help me find my shoe."
MICO:
Yeah?
"Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do."
Right?
You know the man you married.
Look.
"I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh,"
"I'll leave a man behind to watch you, аnd Aisha can get you whatever you need."
Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.
"Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while."
"Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse."
Nah.
It's not you.
"With Aisha, nothing's ever enough for her."
"She helped set up this deal but as soon it's done, me and Aisha, we through."
What you looking for?
Won't know till I see it.
"I know what you want because you and me, we want the same thing."
Isaac.
Why are you worrying about Isaac?
He treats you like a little bitch.
He is still running things.
What if he wasn't?
"What if I said,"
I got a way for you to get what's yours?
Hey.
Theo.
"Okay, okay,"
"I had enough of that when your mom was alive, come on."
"If this is about, uh, Rebecca not coming, we were able to tweak the speech."
"No, no."
It's not about that.
You asked me to do a little recon
For you with some of my old media contacts.
I hope so.
"What do you mean, you hope so?"
"Well, lot of people come here for dogs, but there ain't always enough people to take all the dogs we got here."
We're only allowed to keep dogs here five days.
"We got a couple here now-- they been-been, uh, over the limit."
- Over the limit?
-Yeah.
"Well, what happens to them then, when they're over the limit?"
Got to be destroyed.
"Hey, wait a minute."
"You mean that dog I just brought in here, my dog,"
-is gonna be destroyed?
!
-Right.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, come back... (chuckles)"
Who do I see about getting a dog back?
"Uh, lost dog?"
"No, no, a puppy that I got here yesterday."
And my husband brought him back today and I want to get him right now.
"Well, you'll have to wait till Mr. McGreggor gets out here."
He'll be out in just a moment.
Come on.
- Ralph.
-Alice.
What are you doing with my puppy and these other dogs?
"Look, I hope you're not gonna get mad, but I fell in love with him."
And these other two are over their limit.
"Come on, I'll tell you all about it at home."
"Come on, Alice."
Can't wait to see these little ones.
"- Speak for yourself, okay?"
Can you please just open it?
- For me?
- What is it?
"It's a pony, baby."
"I don't-- Come on, for me, please just..."
These are White House passes.
Yeah.
That might mean we're going to the White House.
And that your dad here has a job interview with the Secret Service.
"This is really cool, John."
"- You're just gonna stick with ""John""?"
- Yeah.
"Now The Roger Skinner Show, today live from the White House."
"Hi, folks."
President Sawyer is one of those academics who never served a day in his life and now he wants to tell the military how to run things?
He's going to make peace with Iran because he has friends there now?
Come on.
"Sir, I have the first lady for you."
Remind me again why we let these guys broadcast from our lawn.
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?
I knew it was something.
"Hey, babe."
How are the French taking it?
The treaty's gonna be a tough sell here.
- How's it going there?
- Raphelson is the key.
"We lose him, then we lose that Southern voting bloc."
"If this goes down, you're looking at a one-term president."
I know two people who wouldn't have a problem with that.
Do you still have that watch I gave you?
"Hey, Christine."
I think we're done.
"I-I have to go, Mom."
"No, they're calling us back to the sabbatical room."
"Yeah, of course it has a room."
"Uh, do you even know what a sabbatical is?"
"Oh, it is?"
"Okay, I-I love you."
I do show it.
I have to go.
Bad news.
Mom and Dad can't make Grandparents' Day.
Why not?
"Dad's run out of miles on his car lease, Mom did some calculations and, at 15 cents a mile, it just wasn't worth it."
Does this mean I can't go to Grandparents' Day?
"No, of course not, sweetie."
"You know what, Uncle Matthew will go as your special friend."
I don't want to go with a special friend.
The only one in my grade who has a special friend is that weird kid with the gray hair.
"To be honest, I'm also getting a little uncomfortable introducing myself as a nine-year-old boy's ""special friend."""
"Daddy, maybe you could go as Ritchie's grandfather."
You guys had so much fun when we went miniature golfing the other day.
"Well, I'd be happy to, if Ritchie wants me to."
"Yeah, that'd be great!"
What?
!
"No, no."
"I'm sorry, that's not appropriate."
Appropriate?
You once dated your cousin.
Second cousin.
And he asked me out.
Just do it!
"You are really rude, aren't you?"
You're making me angry.
It was three days ago.
I saw you walking along side him in the Ginza.
That was in daylight.
"If you continue to do things like that, I'll stop talking to you."
It's just a joke.
"Look, I've always wanted you."
You know that.
Am I bothering you?
"Well, if I am, there's nothing I can do about it."
It's just my rengai for you.
"You know, Mrs. I'm not trying to get you directly, but I am trying to get you."
You are my ultimate goal.
"I was waiting for you to fall in love with someone, and then when that fell apart,"
I was going to snap you up.
"My heart has been broken already, so it doesnt makeanydifferencetome if  youvelovedsomeoneelse ."
"Ah, miss, over here."
I came with Nozu-san.
How do you do.
Thanks for taking care of Shinako for me.
Don't worry about that.
What happened?
"Mother, Kayama-sensei was here!"
Kayama-sensei?
He just left.
What would he be doing here after giving up dancing?
"Mother, I want to meet him."
Don't you think it would be better not to meet him?
I just want to see him.
You should go to Tokyo Station now.
"Right now, my dad and brother Don't believe."
In a damned thing That I'm telling them.
"I mean, sure it would be easier To go somewhere else,"
"But there's a million Dollars at the bluffs,"
"And I'm gonna go get it,"
And there's no on That's gonna stop me.
The only way I can lose Right now.
Is if I get eaten By a grizzly bear.
That's about it.
Coming up...
"You want to grab one Of those samples, sam?"
Hell yeah.
It's almost dark.
We have no place to stay.
We're not gonna freeze to death!
I can figure it out.
Gold mining in the bering sea.
Is a tough way to make a living.
"You need to take chances And take risks,"
And do things that Normal people wouldn't do.
My dad was the one that Originally started.
The icemining idea.
We've been doing it For 15 years.
"Dad built a little fish house,"
"And then put a sixinch Dredge in there, and..."
That was the first time I ever went diving.
"About 10 minutes later, I come Up, and my lips were blue,"
"And I was hypothermic, and..."
"But that's what got me Into diving,"
And looking for gold In the ocean.
10 miles east of nome...
At hastings creek.
That's terrified.
She highlight a subway stop in Queens?
There's got a friend over there.
Field cards from a patrolman Rossi of the 11-6.
You could have knocked me over with a feather.
"I mean, Gillian Booth walking these streets?"
Me and my wife are big fans.
"Now, she promised she'd send me a picture."
"But after seeing how confused she was, I wasn't so sure she'd remember."
But sure enough.
In what way confused?
Like a lost kid.
She said she got on the J train by mistake.
She was wandering around for about an hour.
- Was she on anything?
- Not that I could tell.
"I mean, she knew her name."
She just didn't know how to get home.
It was kind of sad.
- See?
- Great.
"What, did you put her in a cab back to the city?"
"Uh, no."
"I called the bus, sent her over to st."
Jim's.
I gave her a bunch of my cards too.
"Next time she gets lost, she can call me."
"I'll come pick her up, I'll take her home."
Great artist like her.
"EMERGENCY ROOM SAINTJAMES HOSPITAL THURSDAY, MARCH 2"
You know I can't tell you anything about Ms. Booth without a waiver.
"You know, I don't think I phrased my question right, doctor."
"- Yes, you did."
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide but because she hated me.
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
She told me Allison and Norman...
I heard about that woman and her phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"Without thinking, when Allison returned, I told her some terrible things."
What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
"After he died, I came back here and lied and I've been lying ever since."
"You want the truth and when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie.
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
"That I'm committing myself to you all the way and that I plan to worry about you, and take care of you."
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael."
- How's that?
- Fine.
I'll get it.
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?
"If Dr. Helck thinks I'm sick, why doesn't he treat me himself?"
Why does he slough me off on a strange doctor?
Sam thinks it's best or he wouldn't have suggested it.
Mr. Brown.
Yes?
Dr. Croatman will see you immediately.
"May I use the phone, please?"
Certainly.
"How do you do, Mr. Brown?"
I'm Dr. Croatman.
Won't you sit down?
We'll have a little talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
"You want me to take some medicine, give me the prescription, let me get out of here."
"I don't prescribe medicine, Mr. Brown."
Sit down.
Just what kind of a doctor are you?
"Hello, Harold?"
I'm afraid John won't be able to come to the office today.
I've had to bring him to see a doctor.
"Oh, really?"
What's the matter with him?
"Well, we won't know until Dr. Croatman completes his examination."
Will you be able to manage things if John should have to take a long rest?
"If it's long enough, I'll have this business coining money."
That's what I thought.
I don't want to stay.
Let me out of here.
All we can hope is that the doctor finds nothing wrong.
He thinks I'm insane!
I've nothing wrong with me.
I'm getting out of here.
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.
It's real.
That's why he's called Superman.
"Hey, Freddy, where did you find this place?"
Johnny Ola brought me here.
"I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!"
"-I see it, but still don't believe it!"
"-50 bucks, Pat."
"Roth won't go here, but Johnny knows these places!"
"-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it."
-I want to see him break a brick!
"Relax, we're taking you to the hospital."
...and you'll continue to get those.
I don't believe that President Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country.
The American public believe in non-intervention...
Fredo!
Where are you going?
"I'm getting a real drink, because I can't..."
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.
"Reeves, what's the protocol?"
How long should we stay?
I think a half hour ought to do it.
Just long enough to bring in the New Year.
It's New Year's Eve.
"Come on, just for a minute."
There's a plane waiting to take us to Miami in an hour.
Don't make a big thing about it.
"I know it was you, Fredo."
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
"Come on, you guys."
We went on one date.
I know how much you guys like to gossip about everything but we don't want to talk about this at all.
As far as you're concerned we're not even dating.
"- Okay, is that how you feel, Bursk?"
- I was instructed to feel that way.
This day is so perfect.
"I mean yeah, sometimes I do think about a different ring"
"Oh, because the diamond Justin's got you is so tiny and ridiculous?"
"- No, I love it."
"- Oh, yeah."
Me too!
It's so perfect!
No.
It's just because I kind of wish I had my grandmother's ring.
What happened to it?
"My boyfriend Trent, he pawned it to buy protein powder."
I loved my grandma.
It's really all that I had left of her...
"Oh, I know what this is."
You're trying to manipulate me to try to go get that ring back by using your sad face.
"But I'm sorry, sweetie."
It's not gonna work on me.
I'm not buying it.
No!
We're gonna get you that ring back!
Danny is such a jerk.
From now on nobody named Danny allowed in this bar.
My name is Danny.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, man."
I was talking about my room-mate.
Don't you want to feel good?
"Yeah, man."
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
You're just sitting over there like some little brown turd.
Goddamn it!
"You watch yourself, Ray."
"Listen up, motherfucker."
Listen up!
This is what's going to happen.
"We're going to Houston and we're going to sell the shit 'cause this little $15,000 is not going to last."
"Until then, I'm going to hold on to the blow."
"And, Ray, I don't want to hear any more bullshit out of you or her."
You son of a bitch.
Fucking son of a bitch.
"Why don't you just fucking go to sleep, motherfucker?"
You know what you forgot?
You forgot one fucking thing.
You forgot about the goddamn money.
"I got all the goddamn money, motherfucker."
"You keep that little $15,000, Ray."
"He's right, baby."
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
"Think of all that money, huh?"
"We'll be okay, baby."
"Pluto, he knows people in Chicago."
We can live off that money for a long time.
"Baby, it's going to be okay."
We can buy all the blow we want to when we get there and we'll be safe.
Pluto will take care of us.
"We'll be safe, baby."
DUD:
"It's really beautiful, man."
- So?
- So everything's goin' great.
Terrific.
Beautiful.
"I'll need a few more days, though."
"The boys think we oughta cool it for a while, just to make sure there's no heat."
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm levellin' with you."
I need a little more time.
"My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that's all."
It has to be by the end ofthis week.
"Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable."
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem, too."
So nice to have seen you again.
We found a set ofworks on the kid driving the sports car.
- His girlfriend's in the back.
She's dead.
- Give the car a toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"- Jimmy, give it up."
It's all over with.
"Ifthere was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.
"Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down."
I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Break it up!
"It just wants something to eat, and then it's going to leave."
"Let's just make a path of chips to the window so it can get out, but we can't feed it anything too nice or else we will never be able to get rid of it."
"Okay, well, that was my mistake with you."
"Well, hello there."
"Mr. Squirrel, I know exactly how you feel."
I hate people too.
Come on.
Come on.
I've been in the same situation.
"Stuck in a strange guy's bedroom, just looking for some nuts."
Come on.
Come on.
Dude.
Bam.
"Oh, my God, that was awesome."
How did you know how to do that?
I was raised on a lot of cartoons.
"Who was the guys, the, um..."
The...
"Chucky, and Bucky."
Bucky?
Who?
"Chuck... no, Chuck, and the guy with the, the, the..."
Are you talking about rocky and Bullwinkle?
Yes.
Do you know them?
They were basically my parents.
"Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting you were raised in the wild."
"Well, not actually that you were raised in the wild, but more that you were, just, kind of not raised at all."
"But, uh, hey, this is the first time it came in handy."
I don't know what to tell you.
You fell in love with a hood rat.
"""This is fun."
Do it anyways.
"They'll figure out how to save you."""
It just gets quieter and quieter.
Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.
"But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way."
We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.
I'd do it for mine.
"...and then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of..."
Ah...
I don't know.
Let's stop.
I want to stop.
"Honey, please, keep going."
You can't stop now.
"No, I don't want to."
We've been sitting here for five hours.
"Why are we doing this, anyway?"
"Francis, please."
I think we're really close.
Just one more time.
Well...
I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play...
"Okay, honey."
Maybe we'll eat later.
"Lois, did you see what he did in there?"
He used my tennis racket to smash my camera and all my lenses to bits!
I still had film in it from the Us Festival!
Where is he?
"Hal, it's not his fault!"
I'm pretty sure he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.
All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...
You came over here to tell me you told me so?
Yeah.
And I wanted to show you how much nicer I am.
That's because you want to make out with me.
"Uh, not in here."
"It's a little intimate, you know."
And it would be a little difficult since I can't sit on that bed.
Maybe I'll just sit...
Over here.
I feel like such a loser.
I have no girlfriends.
"I don't have any friends either, but I'm not a loser and neither are you."
"It's not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but..."
I miss my room.
I miss my bed.
"I miss my pets, my friends, my family."
"And most of all, I miss my virginity."
"Well, if you want, you can have mine."
(CHUCKLING)
Shut up.
I knew you were going to say that.
"So, what were you girls going to do at your sleepover, anyway?"
Talk about you.
I told you that's my favorite subject.
We can talk about me all you want.
"Cecilia, you are a heck of a mah-jongg player."
Played growing up.
I'm still lost.
"Next time, poker."
"Oh, I don't gamble, but if you make it penny poker,"
I might be willing to lose a buck or two.
"Put the phone away, Dylan."
And I lied to a whole lot of people who you didn't wanna talk to.
And I also listened to your friends tell me what a great boss I had.
As if I needed to hear that.
"Alex, I know you."
I know what a good man you are.
And I know how you've tried with Louise.
I love you for that.
All right.
Now just tell me one thing.
"When you were up in that kitchen a while ago, chopping those vegetables, you were very happy."
Yes.
And why did it change after that telephone call?
"You called her before when I was up there in the kitchen, right?"
You don't get a divorce on the telephone!
What difference does it make?
It's over with!
"Now, wait a minute!"
[Sighs]
I should've told her earlier.
You wanna know why I didn't talk to her?
I just wasn't sure how you'd react when I told you that I loved you.
"[Chuckles] Oh, no."
You weren't sure how I'd react?
- That's right.
"- Alex, what you decide with Louise... shouldn't be tied up with my reactions."
Go and find her.
Talk to her.
"Even if she hates you, she needs you."
And when you've got that settled...
Okay.
All right.
"I'm not going to, uh, lose you, am I?"
Your love blobs looked like Yul Brynner snogging Kojak.
I'm not prepared to rise to it.
Your spite and venom offends me not.
- Baldy blobs.
"- Right, that's it."
That is it.
"I hope you've got a good lawyer, because I am suing and you're going to prison forever."
"Hello, Filthy?"
"Yeah, it's Richie here."
I wanna sue Eddie.
Richie Rich.
Your client.
"I'm five foot ten, brown hair..."
"Look, it's not important."
"My minder, Edward, says that I've got bald love blobs and I want to sue."
Have I?
"Well, they're not so much bald as receding."
I'd put a wig on them for the trial.
"Bloodsucker, what do I pay you for?"
"I know I don't, it was a rhetorical question."
Goodbye forever!
He was furious.
But I persuaded him to give you a chance.
Shut up and tell me why you are wearing a hat that makes you look like you've got a toilet roll on your head.
"Because, Eddie, I have taken up the skillet and the frying pan."
I've been studying cookery all morning and I am now a master chef.
- That's why I'm wearing this great hat.
- You look like a chicken drumstick.
Ha ha!
"Wrong again because, actually, I look great."
- We are having a dinner party.
- Oh-hoo.
- Apology accepted.
"For God's sakes, you're the only woman for me, now hang up the fucking phone!"
"Listen, your skills are missed around here, Frank."
I need you.
"Oh, my God."
"So, how about you come see me at the airport tomorrow?"
It'll be great to have you back.
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, God, yes!"
"All right, Frank."

We must break free from the petty politics of the past.
"America is a nation of believers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics."
"All of the people telling you, ""You can't have the country you want,"""
are the same people that wouldn't stand...
"I mean, they said, ""Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."""

Don't we love defeating them?
"To all Americans tonight, I make this promise."
We will make America safe again.
"I know where my life is going, and I want you to go with me."
"I'm not saying I want you to move in right now but I don't want to buy this place unless, at some point you could see yourself moving in."
"So, what do you think?"
I can't do this.
Okay.
"Well, if it's too fast, I guess we can always just..."
I can't do any of this.
I mean what you're saying and what you're offering is what every girl wants.
It's what I always wanted.
It's just...
You don't want it with me.
Okay.
I have a question.
"Is there any way we could dial it back to before, when we were just sleeping together because I don't know, I felt like that gelled."
Babe?
It was nice meeting you.
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.
You too.
Good night.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You forget something?
"Yeah, I did."
Really?
What did you forget?
This.
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?
Yeah.
I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.
"That's how it's done, isn't it?"
Sometimes.
"Look, I can't stop thinking about you."
It's a problem.
My name's Tanya Chambers.
"I'm a normal, sexually aggressive woman by day, but I have a very special gift, also by day."
I'm a snake doctor.
♪♪
This snake is sick.
I fixed your snake!
This snake is sick.
I fixed your snake!
This snake is sick.
I fixed your snake!
"Everywhere I go, there are sick snakes that I have to help, because if I don't all the snakes will die."
"I would have rather just brought him to a vet, to be honest,"
- but she's supposed to be the best.
- Hooroo!
I'm here to fix your snake!
"Here, I brought Scandal with me to keep your snake calm, 'cause snakes like other snakes."
Whoa!
Did it die already?
"Oh, no, she's just resting."
"Thank you so much for coming, we're really worried about her."
Lizzie is the last gift that my mother got me before...
I'm sorry.
"I just think if she died, it would be like losing my mom all over again."
We really appreciate you being here.
"Cool, do you guys have any food?"
I feel like something hot.
"Um, we have some soup left over."
Does it have any meat or sausage in it?
- No.
"- I don't want it, then."
"Uh, Lizzie means a great deal to Amy and I, so..."
Bloody hell.
"Well, I'm not beat, you understand?"
I'm just a little more respectful.
But I am thirsty.
"Thanks a lot, anyway."
Now wait a minute!
"You know, I saw a man do that one time down in Mexico."
He come on a great big water hole about an hour later.
"All that sweet water, he didn't have nothing to carry it away in."
Like to see a man with a nice even disposition.
Come on.
I've tracked you for six weeks through this country.
You know it just like the back of your own hand.
Where are we gonna find water?
"Maybe the, maybe the Times' place."
They never have run dry there.
Or so I'm told.
But you're gonna give out before we get there.
Tyree.
You don't figure I did this.
Possible.
Hasn't been dead half a day.
"Well, what about Silmser?"
You don't think I stabbed him in the back and did this to him.
Let's bury him.
I asked you a question!
Did you murder a man in Texas?
"I did kill a man, but that was long ago and far away and he had a gun in his hand."
"Now, will you take these chains off?"
"Yeah, there was a girl here, too."
She's gone.
They probably took her.
They?
"Uh, let's get you on a cardiac monitor."
"CBC, chem panel, EKG..."
I realize that.
"I'm sure he is, but this isn't about me, him, or even you."
It's about the welfare of a mother and her child.
You will?
Great!
Thank you so much.
"Um, psych attending's coming down to assess Judy Anderson."
"If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree with my postpartum depression assessment, right?"
"Yeah, you got it."
"Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,"
I have some good news.
One of our attendings from upstairs has agreed to come down and speak with you.
I've seen enough doctors today.
- We're going home.
"- Please, he's on his way down right now."
- We've been here for hours already.
- This will only take a few minutes.
"I just want to go home, have dinner and a bath and put Grace in her own crib."
"You want what's best for your baby, so do I."
Then leave us alone.
- Judy you need to speak to someone.
- She just needs to rest.
I know you don't want to hurt yourself or Grace.
You need professional help.
Do you have children?
Then how do you even know what you're talking about?
- I'm a doctor.
- But you're not a mother.
"Judy, listen to me..."
Please don't go.
I tried to kill a police officer in India by planting a bomb in his car.
"It happened because of a girl and a boy,"
"I got scared of getting lynched there, so I came to Malaysia."
Just a joke!
"It's not a joke, bloody fools!"
It really happened.
"Come on brother-in-law, where's my sister?"
- My son-in-law.
- Son-in-law?
Oh God!
I got wedged!
What if they come to know I chased this girl?
My brother-in-law will break my back.
"They both were in love there, why are these two marrying here?"
"He's no ordinary man, he'll not give up so easily."
Where could he be now?
Can you guide me to this address?
This is the place.
"By the way, you are...?"
I too don't know when will I come.
I don't know what had happened to me.
I don't know why I'm here.
What's going on here?
I invited you.
He's my friend Kalyan from India.
He's my fiance.
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"He's a memory loss patient, he's here for treatment."
He'll stay with us from now.
Okay dear.

"Come on, dog, why y'all ain't clapping, man?"
"Come on, why y'all ain't clapping?"
It's not like he hit y'all.
What the hell?
He's an all-around entertainer.
"He can sing, he can dance, pop-lock, box just a little bit."
"Um, okay, I know he was in a situation with Rihanna."
Okay.
And that's in the past.
"And, folks, you know people's love."

There's a house!
"Oh, it's me."

"Because they want to sell these things to senior citizens and senior citizens tend to be not the best drivers, you don't have to have a special licence to buy an RV."

Two pooping-based questions.
Yes?
"One, when you send down a, you know, a Bismarck..."
I'm Amy Juergens.
I thought you got married to Ricky Underwood.
"Yeah, I did."
Then how come your name isn't Amy Underwood?
"Well, actually, the name Underwood, either."
It's totally lame.
"Yeah, it's gross."
Amy Underpants.
Who needs that?
Not you.
Not after being a teen mom and everything.
Not that Yurgens is any better.
"Uh, it's ""Juergens."""
"Yeah, but it's really Yurgens."
Amy Yurgens?
"(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, Yurgens didn't wear underpants and that is how she got pregnant."
(CHUCKLING)
"Hey, maybe I could be friends with you two."
Yeah.
"You know, I've been dying to ask you how you got pregnant."
"You know what sex is, right?"
"Hey, so it looks like your little mentoree made some friends."
Now we don't have to hang out with her.
"Well, that's not very nice."
I thought you said you were sick of hanging out with her.
No.
"Not sick, really."
Just...
"I really think that she should make some friends of her own, some girlfriends, instead of just hanging out with Ethan, her new boyfriend."
"I don't think she should even have a boyfriend, especially Ethan."
You sound like an old married lady.
"And I remind you, you pretty much hung out with Ben the entire time you were pregnant and forgot about Madison and me."
So that's the problem?
The only difference is that he got caught.
I sit in that courthouse every day and I see how they're doing him wrong.
"Ora, I'm sorry."
"If you need money, I can arrange a loan."
"I want you to tell my daughter, I want Goni to hear."
Why doesn't Daddy's friend come to visit her?
And why he won't let her daddy direct when he knows the truth about all of this?
Please tell her.
I'm sorry.
My darling.
My love.
Did you work on the adaptation?
"What adaptation, Mommy?"
It's a play I did for the theater and I'm adapting it for the school.
For the prison you're going to.
"No, for the school where I'll be working after I get out."
Plays in the theater are more fun.
Schools are nice too.
Then why not at my school?
Maybe there too.
Will you direct me?
That could be very nice.
I told the school they'd get a draft next week.
So they can see it's suitable for kids.
I'll get it ready.
It's annoying that they have to check everything.
Isn't your word good enough?
Why isn't it good enough?
That's the way it is.
Why?
"I want to hear ""There Were Nights""."
"All right, I'll be there."
"Help the guy, fatso!"
- Again.
I'm looking for Miss Guadalupe Mendoza.
- Miss Guadalupe Mendoza?
"Yes, she's here."
She was arrested for disturbing the peace and public exposure.
"You know, the community calls and we have to act, sir."
How much is the fine?
It's 200 pesos according to the law.
She has to stay here for 24 hours.
But if you want we can put her in a cell by herself.
"Shut the fuck up, whores!"
Guadalupe Mendoza?
You're going to sleep in the suite tonight.
Shut up!
"Shut up, you rowdy bitches!"
I want to tell you...
I am a Christian now and...
God spoke to me in many different ways.
For instance in a dream.
"Now I ride a cab and I preach to the people, so to speak."
I tell them to get closer to God.
I tell them you can talk to Christ in different ways.
And thanks to God I'm with him now.
What are you going to do now?
Can you come to the living room when you're done?
"Now that it's sold, why don't we use it?"
I'll be in the bedroom.
Get away from the window.
Why are we getting out through here?
- They can see you in daylight.
Mmm.
Maybe.
Maybe?

"Come on, Joel."
I know that guy's in a hurry.
Wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna hang around and play games.
"Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows... visit the top of the Empire State Building.
"Don't jerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot of time setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major league game, Sal."
One thing I learned-
"Move calmly, move cautiously."
You'll never be sorry.
Look.
I've been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawling all over you like fleas.
Aah.
"Look, I'm telling you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
So let him take his 60 kilos of heroin someplace else... and find how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!
"Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you."
He'll split if we don't move!
This guy's got 'em like that.
What?
Did it ever get bad enough with Dad... that you thought about leaving?
Of course I did.
"I wanted to keep the family together, Michael."
Through the good and the bad.
You kids were so cute.
"Well, it's like Lucy said."
Chances are he's probably still in the area.
"There's no recent credit card activity, no car rentals."
"The only blip, Mike, is where he works."
Greenway Worldwide Cargo off of 57 th.
Talked to my A.T.F. buddy.
"There's, some kind of investigation."
"Uh, some link to organized crime."
Great.
U.S. Attorney's office is all over it.
"Left a message, haven't heard back, and that's about it."
"I should, uh- I should go talk to Evelyn."
"Well, you just talked to her, Mike."
"Yeah, but she was a little flustered the last time."
She might have forgotten something.
I thought you had to get those documents to Lucy.
Your fake I.D.
"Yeah, I'll do it later."
"Something I should know, Sam?"
"- About what, Fi?"
- About why Michael's acting this way.
What way?
He seems fine to me.
Tell me about this new client.
"You know, I just remembered, I gotta get Mike some yogurt."
"You know, 'cause if I don't do that, boy, it's just-You know how he is."
like a shoelace.
That's pretty resourceful.
I know.
"All right, you're good."
I just can't believe he's gone.
Yeah.
And for what?
For trying to save a guy like John Cutler?
"Now, listen to me, all right?"
"Billy saw somebody in danger, and he reacted, all right?"
That's what he did.
And the fact that he knew the kind of man that Cutler was and he still put himself in harm's way?
"He was a hero, Catherine."
Yeah.
(knocks)
I just got off the phone with the lab.
There's something you're both gonna want to see.
What do you got?
"Well, there were no prints on any of the shell casings from our shooter's gun."
But the lab did find traces of blood on one of the slugs from Billy's gun.
Wait a minute.
Billy hit the shooter?
Apparently.
That's my boy.
It must've been a through-and-through.
I bet the slug was imbedded in the cabin wall and our cleaner dug it out.
You run the blood?
"Yeah, we got a match, too."
Our killer's a guy by the name of
Jason Kroll.
He's believed to be a hit man.
"HPD had him as a suspect in two homicide cases last year, but couldn't make anything stick."
"Come on, Tom."
"Wait right there, Tom."
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
"You got anything in your pockets, Tom?"
"I got some Indian stuff here... some shells in a sheepskin, a little bit of change."
You ready?
"No, upstairs."
"Bill, you stay down here."
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
"Don't close that door until I get over to that window, would you?"
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay for his defense?
"I told you, I have no more to say."
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried for anything before?
"Yeah, once."
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
"Tom, I have to move on with this as quick as I can."
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client... however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a...
I've made much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and...
and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art, see?"
And I always wished...
"I think he did too... wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
- Why?
"- Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction... his mind, really, because his person... to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
- It wasn't?
- It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
- Who?
- Lou.
"He never came here, though."
- Didn't he ever come here?
- To the glass house?
"That's strange, 'cause I built it in '49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
- No.
- Why?
Wow!
"I couldn't help wondering why, with all the money that Ward Fowler makes, he could owe Claire Daley that much."
And then it hit me.
"What hit you, sir?"
Coffee?
Thank you.
Did you happen to see a show last August that had to do with a man who was being blackmailed by a woman?
"Oh, yes, sir, I did see that show."
Yes.
He shot her.
Exactly.
Why would Claire Daley blackmail Ward Fowler?
And then how?
"That's where I'm gonna need your help, Lieutenant."
"Have you, by any chance, checked with the Toronto police by now?"
"Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I have."
I thought maybe you had.
And they told you...
They told me that Charles Kipling was an alias.
And that's when you decided to have
Ward Fowler's fingerprints checked with the FBI?
"That is absolutely right, sir."
You're amazing.
"Yes, it turns out that Ward Fowler's real name is not Charles Kipling."
It's John Snelling and you're a...
He's not a Canadian.
He's an American.
And he went to Canada after he deserted during the Korean War.
There you are.
There's your motive.
How would it look if America's favorite detective were known to be a Korean War deserter?
Or hadrt that occurred to you?
"I mean, why do you think--"
Why do I think he had a heart attack at 40?
"Sweetie, I don't know."
But he does work too hard.
"Actually, his new boss is always telling him, go easier on yourself."
The lumber business is very unpredictable.
I kept telling him he should take some time off.
But do you know the truth of it is?
He loves it.
He loves his work.
- lt's his life.
- lt must be great to feel that way.

Thank you.

- Thank God.
I landed the account.
I don't understand.
"When they told me, I don't know, it was like a... this moment because I had to admit that I didn't want to land it."
Because landing it means that I'm really doing this.
"This is my job, this is my life, this is it!"
This is what I really...
"But, look I'm sorry that I couldn't..."
"- you know, handle it or whatever."
"Yes, I did say it."
And what will you do if I stop protecting you?
"You won't go to the refugee aid, and quite rightly so.."
In the camp they're very selective... they only let the politically persecuted through.
"Maybe you are a political, Pauline?"
"Could you give me some money, if I leave my child with you?"
What?
Then I could go to the West...
"You see, Pauline, you really are reasonable!"
Pay attention..
"I've saved up some money, a couple of hundred Mark... for the birth..."
I'll give it to you.
"Well, and you'll also need identification papers."
I'll get them for you!
"As for an ID card and such, Bruno will take care of it."
Then you can go to your fiancée in the West.
"Well, what is it, Pauline?"
Haven't I offered you enough?
500 Mark!
"I'd like to think it over, Mrs John."
"Well, yes..."
I only meant it well..
Just wanted to help you.
You sleep on it...
"That's all of it, Mr Hassenreuter!"
"Yes, my child."
That's all I have left after 20 years of cultural work.
"""The rest is silence..."""

"Yes, my child, you should have seen me as Hamlet... people still talk about it."
"I'd have loved to, Mr Hassenreuter."
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark."
He's still sleeping.
What?
He's still here?
"All right,look,I did something really stupid."
"If you did something bad to Augie,don't tell me."
"I love you,but he's been my best friend for 15 years."
"No,it's not that, but thank you,by the way."
There's a hierarchy.
I'm sorry.
"Alright,look,this is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life."
Really?
'Cause...
Oh!
What is that?
"Bella,I swear to God,if you laugh..."
"Ser... seriously,what the hell is that?"
- It's a merkin.
- Is it alive?
How do you not know what a merkin is?
It's like a toupee for down there.
How would I know that?
"Is it the next link in the chain of crazy, wax-it-all-off-and-stick- something-else on?"
"It's from,like,a zillion years ago when prostitutes would have to shave everything off so they wouldn't get lice."
"That one's a reproduction,right?"
Are you gonna help me or not?
"What do you want me to do,braid it?"
I can't get it off.
"Oh,sweetie..."
"I accidentally put it on sideways, and,and now I can't get it off, and I have a Ted Koppel."
"Oh,sweetie,come here."
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
"From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need."
"Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it."
'Cause it's your decision to make.
"Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing."
And it's what you really want.
"Not,you know, 'cause Mama said this or your dad-"
"Or because you're saving Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some- I'm just sayin;"
You
- Understand what you're saying.
"You want to save somebody money, but still -"
But you have to still do what is best from here.
"But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know."
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm just saying.
"But still, the decision is up to you."
"So, what do you think?"
Ah.
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.
- What time is it?
- 1:56.
56.
"Come on, Bo."
Whip it to him.
"When I was 23, how old was he?"
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
Do they go out frequently?
Juan says he wants to live with Clara.
She's crazy.
He also says you're still in love with mom.
And that you'll always be.
I don't understand why all men are after her.
It was always like that.
Are you in love with mom?
Me?
No.
Love vanishes.
And it never comes back.
"When we decided to split up, my wife assumed that I was leaving and she was keeping the house."
That's what happens usually.
I think it's not fair.
But surprisingly I accepted that as something natural.
Someone had to leave.
"We could've flipped a coin, for example."
And where did you go?
To a hotel.
Even now I still ask myself what I was doing in that room all alone..
Awake and looking at the ceiling.
But wasn't there another woman?
"-Yes, Rosa."
It took some days until I told her I've left Clara.
Why?
I don't know why I didn't go to my parents house in the very beginning either.
And you had a woman..
And a house waiting for you?
And you went to a hotel?
I was there for a few days without unpacking the bags.
Then I reacted and I called Jacoba to tell her I was coming over.
Then you calmed down.
You're stubborn!
Why are you telling me these Jewish fairytales?
I can be stubborn too.
You shouldn't have brought that snake here.
"Bonbons, he brings me."
"He was my friend, he should've been on my side."
Maybe he's trying to fix something.
"I did things that were wrong, Goni."
I know that.
"I wanted to get what was coming to me, no matter how."
But what I did is disproportional to the punishment and to your suffering.
All of ours.
All of our little family.
I carry it with me all the time.
"You know, a few days ago I bumped into someone I knew in 2nd grade."
She used to say I was from a family of thieves.
And that you stole our fridge from the theater.
She can drop dead.
"She can drop dead, I don't care about her."
And I don't care what people said or what happened.
"Your mother and I always thought that you, little one, deserved a better life."
You didn't deserve all this.
I miss Mommy so much.
Mommy is dead.
You're here and I'm here.
Then they started fighting over it.
And?
Then they pulled it from each other and it tore.
And?
Then I told them to stop.
So you became a judge?
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilds having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Benigno.
Am Ito tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
"- Come on, man!"
Let's go!
"Jack.Jack. Okay, the night porter didn't clean the grill, the big blender's broken... and someone crammed my locker full of Spanish pornography again."
- I'll look into it.
- Thank you.
"-Jack,Jack,Jack!"
- Yeah.

"I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know."
"1991, there was a team from Marshall played."

"Now, I need you to get up slowly, and you'll go to that chair, with your hands behind your back, and sit down."

You don't have to say anything.
Just nod if you're cool.
I just need you... on that chair.
"You brought this... on yourselves, guys."
But it can all be over very soon.
I just need one of you to own up to sending the postcard...
- and then we're all done here.
- We don't know who sent the postcard.
"- Please, we don't know."
- He doesn't care if we know or not.
He just wants to screw with us.
- Don't you?
- You got a few moments to talk it over.
I'll be outside.
But I'll be watching.
Luke... with me.
"Did you send the postcard, Luke?"
"No way, man."
I hardly knew your brother.
No offence.
"I'm just a ""party guy"", I bring the drugs and mix the drinks."
"Shallow as fluck, seriously."
"They should be thanking you, Luke."
"If you hadn't have helped out, things might have got a bit more... messy."
You're a good man.

"I don't know, maybe you should just..."
- let it go.
"- I can't do that, mate."
I need answers.
"- Cool, thanks."
"- Uh, why does he get tickets?"
- Because he works here.
"- Well, if I work here, could I get tickets?"
- You don't work here.
- What's that right there?
"- Oh, you... you wouldn't want that job."
"- No, sure I would."
Sign me up.

"- Yeah, for her friendship."
"- Wow, you really are changing."
"- Yeah, I am."

"Okay, now you're talking about yourself in, like, the fourth person."
"Well, it's a whole new dimension of selflessness, Ryan."

"Well, wouldn't be too far off."
No gold over there.
"Okay, tell people that."
"That's a good story, you keep telling people that."
Hasn't been any gold over there for 60 years.
"I watched your dad work that worthless hole for 50 years, and all he come out of there with was a sore back."

You told us that you and your wife don't know her very well.
"So, what are you concerned about?"
You know her a little better than you said?
"I'll tell you everything, but you can't use it to incriminate me."
I gotta ask you something.
-Do you want to have a lawyer here?
-No lawyer. I didn't do nothing wrong.
Why don't you tell us what's on your mind?
-l had relations with Mrs. Garcia.
-What kind of relations?
"You know, intimate, virile."
I couldn't help it.
She fell in love with me.
Her husband worked all day.
"He'd come home at night, drink, beat her."
"Coño, you know, she has needs."
"You're home during the day, work at night."
My wife's a good woman. I love her.
But Luisa Garcia estaba bien caliente.
I had to finish high school first.
Before I go into modelling.
Why not just do it anyway?
"Yes, but unless mum signs the contract Unique can't hire me."
She's been in such a mood since dad went off with her best friend.
Unique will want you anyway.
You're so beautiful.
You are so sweet.
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.
I've been in love with you since the first time I saw you.
"I love you, too."
- I'II go with you.
- Do you mean it?
You make me feel I've come home.
With you I'd be able to get my life sorted.
- You think?
- I know I do.
In New York we'd have our own place   and make our own dough.
And start a family when we were ready.
"No fucked-up parents, no fucked-up friends."
No dope.
- Just us.
- But if mum says no we can't go.
No.
But you are a clever girl.
You'll get her to change her mind.
So your mum says you can't be a model till after high school?
What a bummer!
We were going to come and see you in New York!
"I've just bought a new suitcase, too."
- You look a bit better now.
- Philip's arrived.
For a second I thought it might have been-- lt was like going out the jump door.
I was falling through space.
"Count, sucker, and pull the ring."
One thousand.
Two thousand.
"Then, lights."
The ground batteries had picked me up.
"I tried to side-slip the chute, but I couldn't."
"The lights got brighter, blinding me."
He's coming to.
"Go ahead and make with the music, f riend."
We love it.
"What's the letter say, f riend?"
"- Tell us about it, f riend."
"- Quiet, Krause."
I haven't yet solved the code.
Repeat the message in the letter.
I hadn't read it yet.
I just started to when you sapped me.
You place me in an extremely distastef ul position.
"By nature, I'm a gentleman."
Truly gentle.
Brutality has always revolted me as a weapon of the witless.
Like your f riend Baretto.
"Yes, and Krause here."
Although Krause's inclinations are more psychopathic than intelligent.
"He suffered an injury to his brain once, and ever since then.... lf you make me leave you to his quiet whims, I will never f orgive you."
Go take a flying jump f or yourself.
I'd f ormed a higher opinion of your ability to make decisions.
"The rest is to dance time, f riend."
"You like music, f riend?"
I like music.
...
What you need to take is not the people's judgement.
You should receive my judgement.
If you don't want to see any additional innocent sacrifices... don't block my way.
The meeting is in two hours.
"Oh, Chief Park..."
"Before that, an important guest is going to come looking for me."
"Without a bodysearch, just send him through to me."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Also, I want to be alone for a while."
"But, we can't do that."
"Please, Chief Park."
Since I have some things to think over by myself.
I came here to see the President.
"Yes, he told me."
He's waitng inside.
Please enter.
So you came.
There's nothing for you to do any more.
This isn't a place you should be at.
I told you already
I'll block you with my own hands.
My revenge of 28 years...
you can't block it.
The type of revenge where I have to shoot my real dad.
Do you think I could live well afterwards?
Having the woman I love point a gun at me...
Did you think it wouldn't matter to me at all?
The dad who lost a leg for me.
Having to shoot him... how would that make me feel?
If you ever thought about me even once...
I wanted you to stop.
- I'll drive you home.
"- No, I'll get there myself."
"Okay, Mike."
- Tell me I'm a genius.
- You're a genius.
Come on.
You can do better than that.
Remember the mail we were sorting' through at Doug's place?
"Outdoor Life, Field  Stream."
Got me thinkin'.
Outdoor types always go back to the woods.
"I got ahold of a buddy at the Coast Guard who knows a guy in Park Service... and I said, ""Hey, there's a couple of good bottles of Patrón in it for you if""-"
"- Just tell me, Sam."
- State Parks has a record... of Doug's license plate at Mangrove Campground.
- Keys.
- Yeah.
"Now, look."
"I'd go there with you, but..."
Veronica sort of set up a mini vacation in Boca.
"- You know, one of those swimming' with the dolphins-"
- I'll take care of it.
I can't believe that you found them so quickly.
That's amazing.
My friend Sam may have bruised a couple federal statutes along the way... but nothin' a gift-wrapped bottle of tequila can't smooth over.
"- Well, you won't get in trouble?"
- We found him.
That's what's important.
I knew I could count on you.
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah.
"Well, you're not gonna bring that with you when you go getJasper, right?"
It'll be fine.
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Yeah.
That was great.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Nick, I really hope that you and Jeremy can get to know each other."
"I mean, after his dad left, he's never really had any kind of male influence in his life."
"Uh, but, you know, my father's probably a better choice for that kind of thing."
"No, I can tell."
Jeremy could really use a guy like you.
[Telephone rings]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Liz is sick.
Cancer.
James mooney?
Yeah?
Jonathan goldsmith from the U. S. attorney's office.
I understand Joe nassurn paid you a visit.
That's right.
The police checked the address.
He's disappeared.
Ok.
"Joe nassurn has a lot of nieces and nephews, from Thailand, Cambodia, South America."
"They come through here loaded to the gills with dope, show up at his apartment long enough to crap it out or puke it up, and then he gives them a small amount of money and sends them back home on the next plane."
What do you want?
I want to know the name of the person who put your client on that plane in Thailand.
What will you give her for that?
I'll make sure they don't prosecute her back home.
Prosecute?
Thai juvenile justice is a lot different than ours.
What?
Oh!
it's to remind you of who you are.
I love it.
I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown
As soon as I get back from europe. oh!
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me
And going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
so I need to just stop moving
And contemplate the failure of my life.
Well When you're ready to start moving again
- You know I'll be here.
- Yes of course I do.
Humphrey Where's your mind?
I know it sounds crazy
But I actually-
- I kind of miss high school.
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions
Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch
Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.
Wow. you miss Chuck Bass.
Well not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.
But yeah I uh I think it's safe to say
That the nostalgia's officially begun.
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.
What's up Dan Vanessa?
Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something?
Well I think she'd rather I gave her something else.
- Yeah she made a pass at me. - god. is she hot?
Actually yeah she is.
We should move on as quickly as we can.
"Tom, some of those cows in there are mine."
"What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?"
"We're just gonna water our horses, and we'll be moving on."
You like to buy some of them cows?
"I don't want no trouble, and like I say, we'll be moving on."
How about a little dance?
"Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble."
Dance.
I said dance.
"All right, Mr. Coble, why don't you just ride on out?"
Get that shooter and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
"I'll get you, you son of a bitch!"
"Tom, that little deal back there at Brown's Hole... ought to give you an idea of what we've been putting up with out here."
I ain't never seen roping like that.
Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take... to eliminate this rustling problem... we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
"I'll just have to take your word on that, John."
You got it.
"Hey, Tom."
How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
She's a Wraith.
Maybe so.
"But she's different, I swear to you."
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
Please... lower your weapons and I'll explain it to you.
It's alright.
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.
I raised her as my own.
You live here?
Together?
"This was part of a mine, before the last culling."
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
Gee!
I wonder why.
The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest.
"It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago."
Ten years ago?
Ellia was just a child.
Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?
"So you know about that, then?"
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
"But... when I found a young female lying unconscious, some distance from the crash,"
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
"To this day, the people of the village don't know and you must promise not to tell them."
"If he gets out of line again, I will be back."
Keep it!
Ahem.
"Excuse me, Mr. Reed."
Mrs. Laws is waiting for you.
You wanted to see me?
"Well, you've done it this time, Mr. Reed."
What did I do?
Look.
"Louis, what happened to you?"
You.
You're the one filling his head up with all this junk.
"We have taught this boy to stand up for himself... to fight the bullies, but he doesn't listen to us."
"He said, ""Mr. Reed teaches us differently."
"""Mr. Reed said that we should run from the bullies..."""
"and that Mr. Reed encourages the smaller kids... to practice running, hiding, and eating their lunch quickly!"
"I didn't say ""quickly."" I said ""rapidly."""
- I was trying to help.
"- Well, thanks to your help... every bully at this school is beating him up."
A younger girl did this to him!
"Mr. Reed, have you ever stood up to anybody?"
"Or better yet, have you ever had your butt..."
"Mrs. Williams, I'll handle it from here."
"Mr. Reed, may I remind you... that you are just a substitute teacher?"
No more of this.
I was simply talking about how life is.
I don't care.
Teach only from the books and not your philosophy on life.
That's all for now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
TO THE EFFECT THAT AMERICAN NEGROES WOULD REFUSE TO FIGHT
IN ANY WAR AGAINST RUSSIA BECAUSE WE LOVE RUSSIA SO MUCH.
"I HAVEN'T ANY COMMENT TO MAKE EXCEPT THAT ON THAT STATEMENT,"
"EXCEPT THAT IF MR. ROBESON ACTUALLY MADE IT,"
IT SOUNDS VERY SILLY TO ME.
IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO FIND MYSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC ARGUMENT
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STANDING OF THE BROOKLYN DODGERS
IN THE PENNANT RACE OR EVEN TO
THE PAY RAISE I'M GOING TO ASK MR. BRANCH RICKEY FOR NEXT YEAR.

Uncle Charlie?
Anybody home?
This is Charles Garrisons secretary calling from Hybra Tech...
Mr. Garrison will be working late again tonight and will see you sometime tomorrow.
Stay out of trouble and Julian still needs to mould the lawn.
Where the hell are you guys?
You scared the shit out of me.
You should look into that.
I brought you something to eat.
Way to go Zeke!
Now get out of the way and let me show you how it's really done.
I want to see Acho finally get it right.
"No, that's cool."
Don't be chicken-shit.
"Look at Pyro, he did it and he's a little kid."
You know what they say...
If you fall of a horse you gotto get right back on.
"What they say, if you eat dirt after falling of 6 meters..."
Like he did last week?
You can do it.
"We are all about trust, right Bro?"
"That a boy, show these Barneys how to catch some air."
Shit!
What are you doing?
Center the tire and the ramp does the work for you...
I told you to be one with the bike.
I know how to do it.
"Damm, where are you head theses days boy?"
What you got on your mind?
"Lead, follow or get out of the way."
You alright?
He's out.
Ok.
"Maybe there was some truth in there, but..."
You know what?
"You're seeing who I am, who I really am, after all these years, and that's a good thing."
It's really important for me not to know anything about you.
I don't wanna know that you're an alcoholic or that you killed a guy and had sex with my mother.
You're my therapist.
I need to think of you as superman.
"I can't think of you as drinking and crying and screwing and killing and then ask you to help me with my fear of spiders, you know?"
Yes.
I'm erasing the events of last night from my mind.
You should too.
"- Oh, they're barely there."
- Good.
So last night never happened.
"Hey, boys!"
Now you know my day job.
What can I get yous?
No booze for you.
You have a problem.
I'm not gonna be your enabler.
The meatloaf's good.
Oh!
"Hey, hi!"
I got here as fast as I could.
"I drove like a teenager on coke, but I'm here for you, just like you are for me."
- Great.
How did you know?
- How did I know?
That we were stranded and where we are.
- Dr. storper.
"- Well, you called me, or some woman named Shasta called me and handed you the phone."
See you Saturday.
- Did you find out anything?
"- Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
"Growing up in the kellys' House,"
"You know, we had good times And we had bad times."
But what makes a family.
Is if they stick together Through thick and thin.
"You know, my brother's Always been with me."
"We're a great team, Great combination."
- Whoo!
- Batman and robin.
"You know, he's robin, of Course."
"Whoo, yeah!"
"You know, my dad Doesn't expect me to succeed."
"And I just need to prove There's money here,"
And this is all gonna work out.
They just need To trust me a little bit.
Maybe that's not a path.
There's the path.
Get on that.
"Hey, Stop for a second."
- Right here?
- Yeah.
"Okay, this is it."
"All the what up there, A couple of miles."
"And all the way down there, One or two miles."
"J.J., I really love Your adventures, man,"
But you know this one's In the middle of nowhere.
"Even when you're at the bottom, There's only way place to go."
And that's up.
So I can't do any worse Than from right here.
It's only gonna get better.
"I kind of, you know, Expecting to show up here,"
"We drive the bank, And we jump right in the water."
We're gonna make this River mining thing work.
We work together.
You talk to her.
Sounds like date night didn't go so well.
No.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I just feel like the walls are closing in a little bit."
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I just-
- I get this urge.
"It just flares up, you know, like I wanna get the hell out of here."
"We really need to get a place of our own, huh?"
[Chip grunts]
I'll put a call into Topher first thing.
He owes me.
"Well, he hasn't returned any of your other calls."
"Oh, it's a delicate thing."
"You know, he's probably waiting until they break ground on the hotel."
"Well, maybe you should go in there, you know, in person?"
"- Yeah, sure."
- I know you don't want to because of what happened with the store and everything.
"No, I'm glad that I got rid of the store."
"I mean, sure, I feel bad for the people who came to rely on it, but..."
"I'm sorry, what do you mean by ""everything""?"
"Nothing, I just-- no, I meant that because everything changes so quickly in Venice, you know."
- And I don't want you to be surprised.
- It's only been a couple of months.
Almost four.
I wanna go back to the way we had it.
Okay.
- [bed squeaking] - [grunting] [theme music playing]
"Yes, I could make a killing on my own land, but they had to have the other property, too."
I'd promised I could deliver.
"Oh, I made a killing, all right."
"When I tried to get Somers' option in writing, he wanted more money to cover all those checks that he was kiting, or else he'd block my sale, block it so I couldn't deliver."
"He wanted more money, then more."
"We got into a fight, and-- that's-- that's how I made my killing."
"Axel, for heaven's sake hurry up!"
"The plane won't wait, Axel."
I forgot I need another shirt.
"Here, I'll do that."
It's so nice of both of you to come and see us off.
"Ja, we send you a postcard from Copenhagen."
"And, Mr. Mason, you won't forget--"
The hospital.
Don't worry.
We'll get that land back.
And raise the money.
Mr. Hadley's already helping.
Ja.
I forget my neckties.
Here.
"Edie, you just get him outside."
We'll bring the suitcases.
"Ja, we go."
There is no fool like an old fool.
Ah.
Such a pity.
Hm?
That a man like that should have to wait all those years to get married.
Don't you agree?
You've been my legal secretary long enough to know that that's a leading question.
Here.
"- See, I don't get that."
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.
"You kill people, but I see something human in you."
"But with her, there was..."
There was nothing.
You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.
"I mean, Stefan's different."
He wants the human experience.
He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother so he shuts his feelings out.
"The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel."
Isobel chose the easier road.
"No guilt, no shame."
No regret.
"I mean, come on."
"If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?"
- You haven't.
"- Of course I have, Ric."
That's why I'm so fun to be around.
Why did you wanna meet me?
It can't be to just catch up.
Because I'm curious about you.
But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants:
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you know my uncle?
I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger.
John had a crush on me for years.
He was the first one that told me about vampires.
"So, what made you wanna be one?"
"It's a very long list of reasons, Elena all of which I'm sure you've thought about."
- That's our daughter.
"Hey, Jeff..."
"today, at Ritchie's school, with everybody there, I got a glimpse of what the future would be like, and it is so messed up."
Is that because you and Matthew have a baby?
"Okay, stop-- stop looking at the board, okay?"
I...
Oh!
I like you a lot.
And I like you.
So why can't we just look past the other stuff?
"Look, you've got to understand this from my point of view."
"I mean, what if I said that, in order to date me, we'd have to hang out with your ex-wife and her husband?"
I'd rather have diarrhea.
Exactly.
"I mean, it's great when it's just us, but it's never going to be just us."
It's always going to be weird.
Isn't this a conversation for way down the line?
No.
"Way down the line, I'm going to be in love with you, and then it's going to be too painful to tell you I don't want to do this."
You don't want to do this?
It's just...
It's too incestuous.
You dated your second cousin.
"Actually, he was my first cousin."
And I asked him out.
I think you're making a mistake.
Yeah.
That's what my aunt said.
No.
No.
About us.
What?
Get me an interpreter.
I want to make sure she wants to stay.
If she does?
I'll see what I can do.
I'm looking for Joe nassurn.
My name is James mooney.
I work for legal services of Pittsburgh.
Does Joe nassurn live here?
Do you expect him back?
"If you see him, tell him that his niece kalaya is at the allegheny children's shelter, and to call me right away."
Jeremy.
What's up?
Where's your mom?
She's in with your dad.
You're stuck here till they're through?
My mom is into us having some time together.
Wants to take me shopping.
"The kleiner automotive group doubled their sales to $58 million in the 4 years following the highly visible angry penguin ad campaign,"
"Liz hetherington has won the atta-- the manno and every regional and national advertising award in print, television, and radio."
I tried to buy Liz's company a year ago.
What's different now?
Right.
"Well, she's been very impressed with the growth of your company over the past year and sees this as a, uh..."
Strong synergistic opportunity.
Let's get some numbers going.
Great.
"Mr. mooney, right?"
Right.
"I'm Joe nassurn, kalaya's Uncle."
But earlier you--
I didn't know who you were.
I had to check you out.
The earring.
Eric was with a girl alone in this house.
"Oh, boy."
"OK, sweetheart, I will go have a talk with him."
"No, no, no."
I will talk to him.
I don't want to have any of that father-son winking thing going on.
- What father-son winking?
"- No, I-I don't want to see you go,"
"""Son, what you did was wrong,"" and then, ""Attaboy."" I don't want to see that."
- You think I'd do that?
- I think you'd do that.
"Well, I wouldn't do that."
That just goes to show you don't know me at all.
We'll both just go have a talk with my son.
- My son.
- Ugh!
- Hello.
- You want to tell us anything?
Uh... not yet.
Now I got something to tell you.
We found this in our bed.
What was it you wanted to tell us?
"I just wanted to say, ""Happy Birthday, Mom."""
The other one's on layaway.
"Nothing happened between me and Rebecca, if that's what you're thinking."
Why should we believe that nothing happened?
Look at my face.
Do I look happy?
Nothing happened.
"Well, I'd like to know what you were doing bringing a girl into our room."
"And don't give us some lame-o excuse like, ""She wanted a tour of the house."""
"At some point, we have to address it."
J.T.
"You're all right, dad?"
No.
I'll come see you when I'm done.
Have you heard from your sister?
She's just being Marcy.
"Don't worry, okay?"
All right.
Senator!
Listen...
I know how you feel.
This is a mistake.
You have no idea how I feel.
Sara could be anywhere.
I don't even know if she's alive.
"You offer a reward before the abductors issue demands, we're going to lose the advantage."
What advantage?
"She's out there, pregnant."
"You haven't found my ex-wife, and my daughter's MIA."
Your daughter's not missing.
She just didn't want to be here.
"You know, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I sure as hell can't sit here and do nothing."
"We're going to break into the 11:00 news, we need to go now."
"All I care about is my wife, and the only way you're going to stop me is if you pull out that gun and shoot."
Senator!
"If you're gonna do this, do it right-- look straight into the camera."
"There's a good chance the perp's watching, and if he is, he's enjoying your pain."
Let him.
"We get lucky, maybe we can draw him out."
Thank you.
All right.
Keep them coming.
"See, Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city."
"He was first locked up at 11, and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16."
"See, hits never bothered Jimmy."
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.
"I mean, he actually enjoyed it."
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.
Give me your wallet.
"You might know who we are, but we know who you are."
You understand?
"He was one of the city's biggest hijackers of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters."
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.
And almost all of them were gimmies.
"I mean, they just gave it up, no problem."
They called him Jimmy the Gent.
Tommy...help the lady.
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off about the really good loads.
"Of course, everybody got a piece."
"Thanks Jimmy, I'll be back for the rest later."
"Ok, see you later..."
"Henry, come here."
Say hello to Tommy.
"Youse gonna be working together, okay?"
Help him.
Go ahead.
"Hey Jimmy, you got anything good?"
"And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?"
He made them partners.
For 30 years I work to build up trademark.
Just because we sign contract does not mean that I do not care what goes on.
"The only thing that concerns you, Norstaad, is that I have a further payment of $200,000 to meet in four months, and after that a continuing royalty of 5% on any furniture I sell under your trademark."
I will not let you cheat people under my name.
"That is my design on top, but not underneath."
This is not my chair.
This is not a piece of furniture.
This is toothpicks.
This is trash.
Parker!
Parker!
All right.
"If you want to play rough, I'll show you I can play a lot rougher."
Now go on.
Get out of here.
Get out of here before I bash in your thick skull!
All right.
I go.
But don't think that you bluff me for one minute.
Miss Morrow called about the certified check.
Never mind that.
Get me Reed on the phone right away.
- Who?
- Latham Reed!
And hurry it up.
Would you please tell Miss Morrow that Axel Norstaad is here?
"Sorry, but she isn't in."
Would you care to leave a message?
"No, I've got to talk to her."
I've got to see her right away.
"Well, she just this moment left."
When she will be back?
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
"Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other, to distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets."
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to U S Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon, you like karaoke?"
I know a joint.
"No, I've got to wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
[Horn honking]
I'll take you.
I'll take you.
I just got to make a quick stop first.
[Cheers and applause]
LIZ:
You know what?
"When people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or at the store."
"No, thank you."
You know what?
This is for computer classes.
"You know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gonna blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity is only open for a moment.
"You got to get in while you're young, get the money, and get out."
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
[Screaming] Move!
[Grunting]
[Gunshot] [Bystanders Screaming]
- [Woman Whimpering] - [Bystanders Muttering]
It just went off.
I didn't mean to.
Zucco.
Talk to me.
[Man] He's dead.
You have a phone call in my office.
"Don't give me that fishy look, Doctor."
You just got a nicer job than we do.
[Bystanders Chattering]
[Walton] Plenty of shotgun shells and wire and a box for an alarm clock.
There's a receipt for it.
Alarm clock?
"Well, that didn't figure in the analysis of the last explosion."
"According to the receipt, he just bought it at the corner drugstore sometime today."
But it's not here now.
"I'm gonna stick my neck out, Kojak."
"I think he made a bomb today, and it's not here."
So you think he's got one ticking out there somewhere now... a time bomb?
[Walton] Yeah.
Yeah.
Send Crocker up here with everything I ought to see.
[Seymour] Then it's true.
Danny's dead.
"Sure, he's dead."
"The big, bad copper didn't like what he said in here, so he plugged him."
"The big, bad cop didn't like what he said in here, and you wanna know why?"
Because he's been going around this city killing people.
"Now, if you have any plans, you better get on the phone right now and give your apologies."
"I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect..."
- I know.
You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.
"In the meantime, I suppose you'd like some spending money."
"Here, here's 500."
I'll take that.
It'll take me a few days to get settled.
"By that time, you can get that dough together and tell me where I come in."
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
"What business you want me to handle, what parts of town and what my cut is."
- Your cut?
- Yeah.
"That was the idea, wasn't it?"
"I took the rap, three years."
"You took the dough, made connections, built it up."
For you and me.
Wasn't that it?
"Oh, I see."
Yes.
I understand but you've got this thing all wrong.
"See, I work for Keefer."
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
"If you want a spot in his business, why you'll have to take it up with him."
"Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up with anybody but you."
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.
"That was the agreement, and we're going to stick to it."
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not sad.
I'm not.
You...
Face reality.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
You're lying!
Shoot!
I let her influence me and spoke lines not in the script.
I'm lying?
Why do you say I'm lying?
Because...
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
What do I do?
I can't counter her...
"Oh, right."
Because Dad carries my photo with him every day.
"This line... ""Because Dad carries my photo with him every day... """
That's supposed to be Lola's line.
Angel was pressured by Gong Xi into speaking Lola's line.
"Next, Angel's line should be..."
Dad carries around pictures of our brother and me every day too.
He doesn't just keep your picture.
They really did swap lines.
"Gong Xi made Angel say Lola's lines, and then changed Angel's lines into Lola's."
She actually has the ability to make Angel automatically collaborate with her performance.
Angel fell into her trap.
"No matter how busy Dad is, he always shows up for my piano recitals."
"That's because if he doesn't show up, people will criticize him behind his back."
He...
"Well, I guess that's better than some stupid doll."
- Hey.
"- Dude, I am so screwed."
I'm so glad it's you and not my mom.
Or my brothers.
Or my sister.
Or indeed my half-sister.
Could my life get any more complicated?
- What's up?
- Did you even hear what I said?
A countdown clock.
Dan Silk is counting out the days until I come out on his frigging website.
"""Chad Berry."
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."" That son of a bitch."
What I can't figure out is why is this guy gunning for me?
"Oh, no."
You called him.
Yes.
"Yes, I did."
I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.
You think you're the first lawyer to try and scare this asswipe?
He makes his living from screwing with people's lives.
You just egged him on!
You promised you wouldn't do anything.
I come from a line of people who are incapable of leaving well enough alone.
"If you had any respect for how important my career is to me, you would have listened and not gone behind my back."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
So... where do we go from here?
I'll tell you where we won't go.
"I have never been one to believe that there's gonna be some knight in shining armor, and he pulls up into my driveway and sweeps me off my feet."
"But, you know, I really..."
I really never thought that it was gonna be this hard either.
"Oh, I..."
I have to go.
"So, thank you for not being a complete jerk about this."
Anytime.
Oh.
"And, uh... wish me luck."
"Then I said, ""You know, I know I'm supposed to be humble, but I'm better than that show."
"I mean, I can do more than play a Mafioso's son."
"At least give me a disease or a multiple personality or something."""
I can see how that'd be frustrating.
"And then finally I just said to him, ""Look, I'm not renewing my contract."""
"So, Kev, you got a boyfriend or something?"
"Uh, no."
"No, I don't."
"And, uh, h... how..."
how did you know I was gay?
I got a lot of gay friends.
"It's so much easier hanging out, you know?"
None of that alpha male weirdness.
- So you're not...?
- Gay?
- Yeah.
- No.
My girlfriend's got a theory we're all a little bit gay.
Right.
"Well, right."
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm pretty much fully gay, so..."
- So you have a girlfriend?
We'll find her soon.
I've also looked for her.
"I thought she was in the gap, but she wasn't."
What gap?
The place she goes when she doesn't want to hear anymore.
- What doesn't Emilie want to hear?
- When you argue and stuff.
Let's go downstairs and get a cookie.
Come.
I've packed the basics for him.
We'll wait and see where he wants to sleep.
Any news?
Not yet.
Did Carl or Emilie ever mention a place they call the gap?
No.
Special Branch insist that their concern for the PM and the notebook meant nothing.
We need all the information.
They must have a copy of the numbers.
The head of Special Branch will come in the morning to explain.
- Did Burch say anything to you?
- No.
Any news on the perp?
We don't know how he got your number.
He returned to Zeeland as a stowaway on a train.
We fauna' blood matching his.
- Did no one see anything?
- No.
- But we have the lab results.
"- Hi, don't tum on the heating."
"The preliminary tests of the perp's DNA indicate with 99% certainty, that he's Louise Hjelby's biological father."
I've set things in motion.
"The father's unknown, so dig up more on the mother."
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Everything's not okay.
- Hold on.
You give him an hour with the actors?
That's a joke.
Stop and think before you open your mouth and don't tell me it's a joke.
So that's why it is in the makeup room?
"Do it in the stairwell, for all I care."
Stop overreacting.
You're doing it wrong.
Then tell me how to do it.
"He's here after so many years and is so excited, you could at least give him a proper welcome."
"Believe me, I tried."
- I don't believe you.
"After he got out of jail,"
I asked him to direct in the basement hall.
He got up and left.
"I fought with everyone who didn't want to see his face in this building, and there were lots, there still are."
"You deserve a medal, Alex."
"- The next day, he changed his mind."
"Maybe Mother spoke with him, I don't know."
But he called and said he'd accept my offer.
I sent him the play.
"It was small, but it was a gem."
We chose the cast and scheduled a rehearsal.
"He stuttered, lashed out at the actors, came unprepared, the actors said they wouldn't work with him."
That was a long time ago.
What about the big stage?
Why not there?
"Hello, Yitzhak."
Zeltzer.
Debriefing at 10:00am.
"Stop it, no one will be up at 10.00am. Not even youl"
Wanna bet?
No.
"You'd lose, there's no point."
"By the way, I owe you 10 euros."
I thought you were a heavy sleeper -
I've been ringing your bell for 10 minutes.
Get lost.
I should be the one who's angry.
"Since you lost the case, you pretended to be into me while running after Ronaldo on the sly."
I didn't suddenly become your type overnight.
Why are you doing this?
What do you gain by sleeping with me?
And you?
Fifteen years ago I totally messed up with you.
This time I don't want to miss my chance.
Would it be a problem that you've become my type?
Get up.
Judge Morel just called.
She found you a home.
You've got 15 minutes to get ready.
Where is it?
- Pantin.
You will go and see her after and start reimbursing what you stole.
Have you got any money on you?
"If you mean the 200 euros, I spent it all."
- And how are you going to manage?
- It's not a problem.
It's not a problem to find 200 euros?
I've got as much cash as I want.
It just pisses me off to earn it the way I do.
"-Oh, stanley's polish, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"Something like Irish, isn't it?"
well....
I bought some nice clothes to meet all your lovely friends in.
well....
I'm afraid you won't think they're lovely.
"well, anyway, I bought nice clothes and I'II wear them."
I guess you're hoping I'II say I'II put up at a hotel.
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
"I've got to be near you, stella."
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because....
"Because as you must have noticed, I--"
I'm not very well.
You do seem a little....
will stanley like me or will I just be a visiting in-Iaw?
"I couldn't stand that, stella."
You'II get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him--
"-Oh, he was an officer?"
"-He was master sergeant in the Engineers Corps, decorated four times."
He had those on when you met him?
I assure you I wasn't just blinded by all the brass.
"-Oh, that's not what I--"
"-Of course, there--"
There were things to adjust myself to later on.
Such as his civilian background.
How did he take it when you said I was coming?
"-Oh, he's on the road a good deal."
"-Oh, he travels?"
Good.
Look Mom!
Maybe she used to watch me from right here.
But she hated movies.
The only one we saw together was Dumbo.
Takizawa-kun!
I'm fine!
I wanna keep watching you.
Target acquired.
He's in front of the merry-go-round.
Finally found them...
How dare those jerks sneak off on a date...
Is this... thanks to you I remembered that I once lived in New York.
Get in!
Are you the one who called me yesterday?
Yes.
Prime Minister Iinuma's wife requested I meet with you in secret.
The Seleção aren't the only ones who don't like your request to become king. and she loathes you for it.
Then why does she want you to bring him back?
Mrs. Iinuma wants to hear it straight from his mouth.
And I personally want to see what happens with you as king.
What do we do?
I already deleted the new search engine.
Take the Eden of the East System down.
That should at least buy us some time.
How much would that help?
It'd give us exactly 48 hours.
More evidence of how incredible our Eden really was.
Eden of the East 000 NEETs in Toyosu anymore.
It's being used by people all over the country.
We have no choice.
Micchon?
I switched over to the wireless LAN.
It's only Fairclough's word.
And he was telling the truth.
"And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"
"Really the truth, that's where our loyalties are, not in clocking up convictions."
"But there again, if the truth doesn't suit you, you can always do what Charlie Fairclough did."
He invented it.
And no-one noticed?
"You have to trust people that you work with, unless you have a very good reason not to."
There's no other way.
So I'm going to find the truth.
That's what's going to get Michael King out of jail and put away a murderer.
And not by what your opinion is of me.
(Everyone applauding for Jack)
"Come on, back to work."
It's not Ladies Night at Masonic Lodge!
Mr. Mullett.
Superintendent.
Goodbye.
"Darling,"
Yep.
It's Inspector Frost.
Thank you.
"You're back, Inspector."
If you think you can just walk in here and talk to James.
"No, no, it's you I wanted to chat to sir."
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Barr."
"Yes, well the thing is,"
I don't think that your brother killed his wife.
You've arrested Sheridan?
"No, no Mr. Sheridan's innocent."
He's got an alibi.
"Your brother would have had an alibi too had he gone to Bristol, on your instructions."
"No, mom."
Close but it's not what you think.
What?
"What are you talking about, marcus?"
Relax.
I'm talking about monica.
- Oh.
- She's doing really well.
"Yeah, and she's like a new person next to how"
She was when she went in.
And she's coming home soon.
"Oh, that's wonderful news."
I can't wait to see her.
"Yeah, and the good news is today is her pre-Release evaluation."
"So say a prayer that they feel she's ready to come home,"
Because i miss her.
And monica also had some news
"She wanted to share with all of us,"
But she wouldn't tell me what it was.
"Oh, that's wonderful, marcus."
Yeah.
I wanted to share the news with regina.
"I was hoping that it would make her feel better about monica and things,"
But i guess it's not gonna happen today.
I know this is not the right time for her.
"Well, i wouldn't get my hopes up if i were you."
She does have a lot of feelings
That she has to deal with about monica.
And we won't even talk about this new mess.
I know it's been hard for regina
"When it comes to dealing with monica and this situation,"
But i also know she loves her daughter very much.
It all boils down to the old question.
Is there a life after marriage?
She just didn't wanna hurt my pride.
Wants me to think that I'm the breadwinner.
Pretty soon the romance goes.
"And, as the song says women get weary wearing the same shabby dress."
"Well, then, that's the time to go out and buy her another shabby dress."
That's why she's doing it this way.
Instead of just wapping up a million dollars.
"I guess I have been selfish forcing her to give up her witchhood, live on my salary."
- Poor little witch.
"- You see, the thing to do is to try to keep the magic in your marriage."
I guess I'll just have to go along with her.
She's been a great wife.
Be my way of saying thanks.
"Oh, listen, you're welcome."
"Anytime, Darrin, old boy."
Anytime.
"Oh, Darrin!"
"Oh, it's..."
It's beautiful.
"Well, you shouldn't have."
"Oh, but I'm glad you did."
"Well, I can afford it."
Because you got the Waterhouse account?
"You guessed I would, huh?"
"Well, you deserve it."
It's beautiful.
"You like my gift, huh?"
"Well, Darrin, you know what they say."
"It isn't the gift, it's the thought that counts."
"Oh, yes, of course I like it."
"Oh, it's these jokes Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch."
"Ben Littmeyer, from the sociology department?"
"Yes, oh he has the best sense of humour."
I finally convinced him to host the fundraiser.
"Well, why didn't you ask me to do it?"
I have a wonderful sense of humour.
"Nina, come in here."
"I have a wonderful sense of humour, don't I?"
Ohhh.
See?
- Oh!
"This is an important fundraiser for Pendleton, and Ben can get those fat cats to cough up some cash."
Well I can make a fat cat cough.
I can even make him vomit.
"Thanks Dick, but Ben already said yes."
You don't think I'm funny?
"Oh Dick, you're loving, and intelligent, and sexy.."
and funny?
- Oh!
I have a class!
I am funny!
I am funny!
I am!
What happened to your coat?
"I don't know what happened to it, so Mrs. Dubcek let me borrow this one."
Sweet woman.
So you lost your coat?
Oh tough break.
"I lost more than a coat, Tommy!"
"I lost a friend, a buddy, a companion, who kept me warm when it was cold and warmer when it was really sort of too hot to be wearing a coat."
"Tommy, look, you're the information officer."
What do you know about this thing they call a sense of humour?
I got good news and I got good news.
Which one you want first?
Whatever's faster.
"All right, the sample of sawdust from the roof is identical to the sample we found in Coach Nelson's chest hairs."
And I finally determined the species it came from.
Fagus Sylvatica.
Beech Willow Tree.
"Which is indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
Could be where our killer lives.
Or just where he set up his chop shop.
See if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
Got ya.
Kyle Sheridan?
"Three count, buddy."
You lose.
High school wrestling team?
Four oer brothers.
Come on.
"Whoa, Coach Nelson."
What happened to his neck?
It was separated from his body.
And the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
"Whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?"
We found sawdust on his torso.
"Sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
So?
"You're the only kid on the wrtling team who is from Flushing, Queens."
We found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
"You were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?"
No.
"You leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy."
"Right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?"
So is there an echo in here?
Why him?
Because he's a hero!
So?
"Well, how do you know he's a hero, if he doesn't do anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
Are you trying to put up a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
Johnnie can't go in the water!
He's injured.
Badly injured.
Manly slash on the biceps for Christ sake!
He's...he's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"""Mrs.Rosen Lily story"" and you won't let them do anything."
Then go to Dunkirk.
And Johnnie pirates them home.
They are girls!
Here girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to have by him!
Huh?
Tom?
Cab.
"And back in there if Viper just even gets her nose through the office door while we are out, you are sacked!"
"And don't think I won't know, I can smell her shaving cream on the wind."
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up."
I heard furniture.
"Angels of the sea, across the waves, two to Dunkirk, three to Dunkirk, Dunkirk O'bust, busts Dunkirk."
"Somewhere in the world, there is bullet with that man's name on."
Why hasn't he been called up?
Apart from Parfitt's too old.
"But, Buckley?"
- Is he willing?
- Let me worry about that.
"Karl, go after him."
Okay.
"Hey, watch where you're going!"
What's the big deal?
I'm looking for someone.
"Pardon me, Your Excellency!"
Have you seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
Has a guy with a brown fur collar been in here?
I haven't seen him.
You seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
A brown fur collar?
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
Who sent you here?
"If you haven't seen the guy, then why should you care?"
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
See?
He's seen 'em!
We need to know who sent you here.
I don't have to tell you my business.
"If you ask him if a guy with a brown fur collar was in here, then he can ask you who sent you here."
I still don't have to tell you who I am.
"No, my friend."
"If you ask him a question, then he can ask you one too."
Otherwise just don't ask him.
I still don't have to tell you my business!
Then he doesn't have to say if the guy was here.
It's just logical.
Aren't you the clever one!
Fine!
Go on being clever!
Look at that cannon!
Would you mind?
"Don't be ornery, Bill."
Let him see it.
Yankee army issue!
Where'd you get it?
"I say, where'd you get it?"
Took it off a dead Yank.
Which battle?
Battle for our hen coop!
"That's all any of them Yankees are, chicken stealers."
You hear that?
Chicken stealers!
"[conductor] Station-stop, Kingston, Kingston."
What do you think you're doing?
He didn't mean any harm.
He just can't help playing jokes on people.
I wasn't speaking to you.
Why'd you go and play a cheap Yankee trick like that?
You're right welcome to the seat.
I was just havin' a little fun.
I'll be dogged if he can't even talk like a Yankee.
"Sit down here, pint-pot, and see if you can teach me."
"[Pittenger] In spite of Campbell and Buff um, we all reached Marietta in safety and spent a restless night in the Railroad Hotel."
"With the dawn, we were ready for the big day."
Two fair days in a row.
You don't know what that sun means to us.
"What are the fine clothes for, Mr. Andrews?"
Today I'm an official of the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
"- A very high official, I hope."
"- You are the president, at least!"
It's 15 minutes till train time.
"God, that girl."
Is this whole house falling apart?
[SIGHS]
Oh!
"Christine, what are you...?"
Get off of me.
Just forget the sangria.
Bring some wine.
"Uh, Marly."
"You know, I don't work for you."
And I quit.
What?
"You know, I have been such a good sport up until now."
"But, I mean, I'm getting really tired of you and your friends looking down on me."
Why would we look down on you?
Since you came to this school the only person you've had something in common with is my maid.
"You know, uh, I could say something right now that would really hurt you too."
But I'm not gonna do that.
Because I'm a much nicer person than that.
You're too tan.
You know what would be great?
"If you could stop judging me for, like, a minute and give me a break."
Me judging you?
"Yeah, look, you've got it easy, okay?"
You don't care what people think about you.
You don't try to impress people with your car or your marriage.
Your clothes.
"I mean, you cut your own hair."
I don't cut my own hair.
This cost 60 bucks.
"Okay, you don't spend a lot of money on your hair."
The point is you seem very comfortable with yourself.
Hmm.
"Um, we had a fairly intense screaming match."
No.
"Wherein I suggested that you take your head and store it within yourself in a fashion that, while, while space-saving, might limit its exposure to, to sunshine."
"Well, that describes 95% of my employees and everyone in my family..."
except for my dog.
:
He's such a good boy.
Well...
"I'll see you later, uh..."
Randall Wilkerson.
Marshall Eriksen.
"Gary Dinkersfield, right."
"Great, he doesn't remember you."
Not great.
Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall-- that's no big deal.
He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know that he cuts loose.
He just fired What's-His-Face.
"He fired What's- His-Face, Ted, and What's-His-Face was invaluable."
"Look, I can understand you getting upset, but it's not worth killing yourself over."
"Yeah, wait till you get laid off, then kill yourself."
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now it's more like Where's-His-Face.
"Look, it was just two cigarettes."
"Okay, I can handle two."
"As long as I don't have three within 24 hours, then I'm not going to get hooked again."
What's Lily going to say when she finds out you smoked?
Lily's not going to find out.
I have a system.
"Ah, yes, Marshall's system."
"Hey, Lil."
That's...
And a few baboon friends that my brother shot.
I bagged some too down there.
But otherwise down there I usually shoot with a Steyr-Mannlicher 868 S caliber.
I have to say it's the best caliber for antelope and game because so far I've never missed a shot.
"And never needed more than one shot for an animal, thank God."
There are enough sleepers in Austria.
It's them we should fear.
Not normal people.
Them.
"And, unfortunately, there's also..."
There didn't used to be...
preachers of hate.
They preach hatred in Austria.
Why?
I don't agree.
"You have to... investigate who's doing it, who's stirring up hatred."
The Koran has both.
"The Koran has evil and bad- I mean, good in it."
It's not just bad.
"I was talking with him and asked, ""What are you?"""
"He says, ""I'm an Austrian."""
"I go, ""Sure, but at the European Cup you scream ""Turkiye, Turkiye!"""
"He says, ""Yeah, I'm Austrian, but I'm Turkish."""
You see?
But he's more Turkish.
Even if he was born here.
It's a typical case of oriental logic.
- They can't think logically.
- He has Austrian papers...
They can't think logically.
Because Islam teaches them that logic is something that goes against God.
Didn't I run fast?
That's fine.
"But you have the plates, don't you?"
"Yes, the plates are with me."
Kania is in for some complications.
Baba and Nawab have burnt down our godown.
That's destiny.
"If you say, I will blow apart both of them."
You are my younger brother.
I can sacrifice several such godowns in your name.
- l won't involve you in this fight.
- Then would we sit quietly?
Enjoy yourselves.
I am there to look after the business. I am your elder brother.
Nawab and Baba are the backbone of Uncle.
Everybody knows.
Only I know what the weakness of Uncle is!
Do you know what Uncle's choice is?
"He likes gold, Mona, and Mona along with gold!"
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
Let me think it over.
I am your nephew.
I am your blood.
"By working as an ordinary driver in your business not just me, even you are insulted."
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
I am constantly worried that because of your foolishness the two of them shouldn't have to face trouble.
What did I do to make such a thing happen?
So you have come?
"These are my two arms, my two tigers..."
Baba and Nawab!
What's the matter?
Why are you so sullen?
-That's right.
That's where I want it met.
Impossible.
"They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI."
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
"-Tom, you surprise me."
"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone."
-Rocco?
-Difficult.
Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
"Just consider this, Michael."
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
"Are they worth it, are they strong enough?"
Is it worth it?
You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom."
"Just my enemies, that's all."
"Are you with me in these things, or what?"
"Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas."
"Why do you hurt me, Michael?"
"You""re the one who will have to change."
"I don""t like it, but I work within the system."
"- Maybe you""re right."
"- Of course I""m right."
You need to spend less time with the kids and more time in the sack.
You smell good enough to eat.
"All that hot, warm syrup."
Cherries.
How could Mike not appreciate this body?
"L""d never get tired of this foot, knee... or this little spot right here."
I love you.
"I don""t know what I""m supposed to tell her."
Her own father left me.
"And the next two-faced liar I met, Bo... slept with my best friend when I was in the hospital."
"In the hospital, Lucas, having surgery on my right ovary."
Cassie knows this.
"She knows I found that slut""s library card sitting next to my birth control pills."
"Like Karen""s ever read a book in her life."
Cassie remembers how her mama struggled.
Remembers all four of us crammed in that stinky one-bedroom apartment.
- The one with the all them red ants.
- And that creepy neighbor.
He was a pervert.
Registered and everything.
I looked him up.
"L""m just trying to protect her."
"She""s my baby girl."
"Can I get some help over here, y""all?"
Hello?
"Miss Bacha, you""re gonna have to hold on."
"L""ve got a situation here."
"Why are you arguing with me, anyway?"
We should celebrate.
"I have no champagne, so here... this will have to do."
Here you go.
"Drink away, man!"
When is the big day?
All right.
"You know that I like... there's this bowling tournament in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to, so I figure..."
I'll just take care of everything at once.
"Like, I got a thousand dollars saved up already, all I need is like... 4,000 more dollars."
"Please, don't ask me for money, bro'."
"- Not from you, from the store."
"- I can't do it, man."
You told me the other day how much you're taking in a week.
- You don't understand.
- I'll pay you back.
- It's not that.
"- Then, what?"
- There's some shit you don't know.
- What?
What I don't know?
"Right now, for all intents and purposes, your father owns la bodega."
- Get the fuck out of here!
"- Mickey, I ain't fucking around."
Why do you think I took over the store?
- You think I want to run this?
"- No, but your papá..."
"Yo, listen man."
"Your father told me I had no choice,"
Eddie's into him for 25 fucking grand.
"How is he gonna give your father 25 grand, and he's not gonna give me nothing?"
What the fuck!
"Look, chill, man."
We're doing it the Tommo way.
Now we know how to make camp fires.
"Louis, you idiot!"
Right.
I think we'II just burn it like that now.
"Do you think if one of us wasn't in the band, though, the band would be this big?"
-No.
-No.
definitely not.
I don't think so either.
I think we each balance each other out.
Yeah.
"I think when we look back at this no matter what we do after this, we'II never, ever beat this."
"Yeah, but isn't that scary?"
-If the best times of your life are now...
-Don't you think it's a bit...
-...that's crazy.
"-...of a Benjamin Button thing, though?"
That we get to do it backwards.
Do you know what I mean?
"We get to go after this and then have a proper, normal life."
"Just have, Iike, a wife and kids."
Do you know what I mean?
Don't you think that's quite nice?
That's what I Iook forward to if I Iook forward to anything.
What's mad is that one day we won't be doing this.
-I know.
-Yeah.
"So do you think, Iike we're still gonna be mates?"
"-I think so, yeah."
-I think we will as well.
Do you want my e-maiI now or shall I give it to you later?
I think it's better this way.
"Yeah,well... you're wrong."
Moo?
How are you?
What are you doing out here?
"Hi,my name is Bella."
I think I may have found your cat.
"No,I was gonna try and grab him,but I was afraid he'd run."
"Um,yes."
Class of '92.
Shut up!
No way!
"Tommy Anzide,how are you?"
What are you doing?
AUGIE:
"Bella,you got ten seconds before I take your turn!"
"Ten,nine,"
Thank you.
Tell me you took a long time just to make me a burrito.
"Oh,look at that."
You covered your hideous mole with a Band-Aid.
Thoughtful.
"Seriously,just get that removed."
I will when it gets colder.
# I'll blame it on a place #
# Where I keep my questions hidden... #
"At this very moment, in the town of Couer d'Couers  a girl named Chuck was attending her father's funeral."
"The only parent she had ever known was accidentally, inadvertently killed  by the boy she loved  who was, at this very moment  attending his own mother's funeral, who had actually died twice."
It was a blood vessel bursting in her brain  that caused Ned's mother's first death.
"However, young Ned had a secret gift:"
He could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
"Minor shaker, Dr. Stegman."
We have them from time to time.
It will stop shortly.
"You can let go now, Elmer."
It's over.
I would have said he was totally gorked.
"Oh, he was."
What happened here?
In medical terms?
A miracle.
But there's a price to be paid for the miraculous.
And Blue Cross doesn't cover it.
This is Kingdom Hospital... where the ground is uneasy... and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface.
"Please, come again."
Thank God you stopped.
"Okay, um, I'm not even gonna get into what's wrong with the actual choreography."
"I'm gonna start with your shoes, okay?"
I told you to get Capezio jazz oxfords.
I will get those shoes today.
"You'll get the shoes, but you'll also get the steps."
"So we'll break it down one more time, and just watch only my feet."
I've been doing this since I was seven.
My sounds are a little off 'cause I don't really practice that much.
"Uh, you know what?"
"I can do that, but not the way you're doing it."
I can go...
Why can't I just do that?
Because that's not the choreography!
- There you go.
"- Okay, I'm gonna think about this."
You move your feet.
I believe the number-one source of violence in our world is poverty.
"Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood."
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.
"And my best friend Ricky, he had it worse than us."
One day things got so desperate for Ricky he made a plan to rob the corner store.
And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?
"She had him over, cooked him a full meal and told him that he could stay with us as long as he wanted."
And it was then that I realised that if you feed a man... you take away his propensity for violence.
"Come on, we're gonna be late."
"Hey, hey, hey-"
"No, no, no."
That's-
"- No, that's not-- That's not--"
This is not happening right now.
"Clyde, we've had this conversation."
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.
Will you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
"Look, man, I like squirrels personally, but you're getting me in trouble."
Do you see this?
You know what this is?
Hey.
We gonna need backup?
We're working.
Come on.
- We have any more Robitussin?
"- Yes, sir."
In the car.
"No, I'll get it, it's all right."
Quiet night?
We're under attack by squirrels.
I have to go.
Gas company?
My father.
He's in prison for fraud.
"When my grandmother died, she left us some money."
He says it's to pay back the people he's defrauded.
"It's all done under this pretence of ""I wanna get to know you better."""
Can't blame him for that.
What do you mean?
"Well, he must be very proud of you."
Must want to have a relationship with his daughter.
"Yeah, I just don't trust that that is what he wants."
"Sounds like he's tying to put things right, paying people back."
Maybe you need to stop being embarrassed by him and forgive him.
"You really say what you think, don't you?"
I haven't got the energy or the time to pretend any more.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
"Oh, it's Leo."
Hello?
"Yeah, he's right here."
Why?
What's happened?
You're right.
"It's so much better, purer, just... to do it, without recourse to who or why."
When do we kill again?
I think that'll be your last one.
What?
You've made too many mistakes.
"But you said yourself, the less we care, the more likely we are to get away with it."
I'm not sure we have the same motivation.
But I do.
I have the same ideals.
Lift it up.
Dump it back there.
Stop!
You put Butterscotch Betty down.
"Oh, we were just looking for a price tag."
I know what's going on here.
You're hiding the good dresses to make sure no one else can get them at our annual half-off sale tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what we're doing."
We're hiding the good dresses.
"In fact, I just caught another Sneaky Sue."
"Oh, I'm Sophie."
"Oh, wow, wow, wow."
"Oh, look at the color."
That's not color.
That's radiation.
That dress is a one of a kind.
Meaning there's only one?
"No, we have two."
And I have two bridesmaids!
I love it when life works out perfect like this.
[indistinct chatter]
"(Public address announcement) Ladies, our half off sale will begin in a minute."
Look at this place.
There are more desperate women crammed in here than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert.
I know.
It's like Black Friday at Walmart
"And like Black Friday, hopefully someone will trample me."
"Cause thanks to these dresses, my life is over."
"Max, did you hear me?"
My life is over.
You said that when the Chinese food place forgot the duck sauce.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I had a whole other scenario planned for my return to The Times."
What are you doing here?
Who would have thought of seeing you?
"I was just writing to you Come in, sit down I , er"
"I've nothing to offer you but myself, I'm afraid"
That's all we wanted Well
So what were you writing?
May we read it?
"Oh, no need"
You can read it in the room
It's all up with me here
"If you'd have come an hour or two later, I'd have been gone"
"Yes, I'm selling out That's the end of another career"
Is it really as hopeless as that?
It is
"I'm so near disgrace here, they'd rather be rid of me"
And it's not just the debts
"Wait, maybe when you come back, we should just sit down and talk."
Just the three of us.
What do you think?
"You want us to come with you, Dad?"
No!
"I mean, I have to do this myself."
We really gonna talk?
I brought a six-pack.
"If things go south, we can just watch the game."
You want to laugh?
That last box of stuff that Dad packed into his car was my stuff.
No way.
Oh no.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
"Hey, you know, I don't have a problem with hugging."
"I mean, I don't."
"Before, I only ate my sister's leftovers."
Why?
"My mother remarried, and I was like the third wheel."
She pandered to my new father.
"Once she had his kid, she completely ignored me."
"She didn't feed me, so I ate leftover rice in the wee hours."
I felt like a ghost.
Are you serious?
"Yeah, she didn't even take me on family trips."
You don't have to believe me.
So you ran away from that.
I abandoned her.
I stopped going home and started staying out with friends.
"Not really friends, but just people to hang out with."
"One day I came home late at night, and my mother said to me,"
"""Would you please just die?"""
"No way, I just couldn't take it anymore."
There's a threshold for how much we can endure.
So I packed my stuff and left.
You see...
"Because I was told to die, I refuse to."
"I'll sell my body if I have to, I'm gonna survive no matter what."
Aren't we doing it?
"No, we're not."
Then what's that on my back?
The body has its own ideas.
"You know, I've never done it with someone I like."
My first was with an old bald guy.
I see.
I want to.
Thank you.
What happened to work?
Who's number one?
No one ever seen him.
But he once killed three ninjas... with a fingernail file.
Who's this?
"There's a place about two blocks up from you, it's look like a hardware store."
"If it's closed, that's only what the sign says."
"Hold on, hold on, I gotta take a piss."
Oh what else is it...
How many times you must take a piss and you gotta take a piss?
- Not every time
- Good spot here.
"Every single time I gotta take a piss, you gotta take a piss!"
"You're not supposed to look down when you pee next to another man, ok?"
- I'm not looking...
"- You're lookin' down, I saw you look down!"
- I'm looking at your face.
"- My man, why are you looking at me all?"
Dude you get me worried about you sometimes.
Don't you know pee etiquette man?
Let's hope she hurries.
What's the big deal?
!
Who's comin' over?
It's not important.
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me where you stashed that money or anything.
I'm expecting company because of something else I did.
What else did you do?
I robbed somebody.
Somebody else that's not our Boss?
Yea.
Who?
- Donnie Daffo.
Tell me you're sending this.
She's relaying a message.
"It says ""century""."
Starbuck's been hit.
I say again :
Starbuck's going down.
"There's really not much more on the eye in these scriptures, but there is... several interesing stories about the temple."
Listen to this.
"""Five pillars of the temple were fashioned after the five priests"
"- devoted to the one whose name..."""
- Laura.
What ?
The cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others.
"She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the cylon baseships."
And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
The child is alive.
Yes.
Yes.
The child was at the school.
"Yes, I kept her there."
And we suspected that the cylons captured her during the exodus from New Caprica.
"Yes, it's true."
"Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when she..."
Do you have any idea what we've gone through ?
You of all people... know what it's like to lose a child.
The difference is your child's still alive.
"And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that."
I want to see her.
"What you mean, she's gone down."
Gone down where ?
Somewhere in the north valley.
"Okay, get your men on the line."
"However, unlike Freddie Lau,"
Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now.
Impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA from her body.
Freddie Lau's casino is less than a mile from Pleasure Palace where Fenchurch worked.
You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out similarities in their deaths.
Strangling is not a common MO.
HARRY:
Such a clumsy way to kill someone.
What?
You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes.
You really have to hate them or love them.
HARRY:
Who's that?
Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov.
Jumped off his penthouse balcony.
Not much left of him.
It's going to take at least another 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
SURI:
Harry?
Kaleem intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kaleem, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Kayleigh Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone new was trying to muscle out Freddie
- but Freddie wasn't listening.
- Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Yeah, but Kayleigh Fenchurch's murder was so precise."
"You know, no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
"Freddie Lau, his body's just dumped in an alleyway."
Sloppy
Check out the CCTV in Soho on the night Freddie died.
Bevan?
"Yes, Bevan."
"Bevan, yes, yes."
"Bevan, your boyfriend Bevan."
Fiance.
Just rooms and rooms full of bleeding saints and fat cherubs.
"There's this room full of these Goya sketches, sort of man's inhumanity stuff."
I could hardly breathe.
Felt a bit the same when I saw Pica's stuff.
Did Goya murder kids too?
No.
And you don't judge artists by the way they live their lives.
"I don't care if he can sing, write, paint and dance all at the same time."
An arsehole's an arsehole.
Isn't it time you went on a diet?
"No, I'm a good weight."
How long have we got this room?
How long does it take to fix cancerous testicles?
Oh.
"Oh, geez, Keith must be pissed."
He never used the bloody things when he had 'em.
Found out what our boy did with his money.
Yeah?
"He paints a masterpiece, sells it at grunge markets for a fiftieth of what it's worth, then wanders around the city handing out wads of cash to homeless people."
Jesus Christ.
We're defending Jesus Christ.
I don't need money.
"That was Denny Lorton, my previous life."
Now I find it an intrusion.
So that's what you were doing in a lane that night?
You were giving Ben Rigby money?
I'd been told about him.
I wrote this song about
An 11-year-old girl who wanted to be a rock star.
"But she also wanted a normal life, so"
She pretended to be somebody else and
"That was great for a little while, but"
She's 17 now and life is even more complicated.
And she just doesn't want to pretend anymore.
Her name is Miley Stewart.
[Audience gasps]
Whoa.
Take that kitty cat flushing a toilet!
[Laughing]
Anyway.
"It's been a long time since I've sung without my friend here, so"
I hope you like it.
"[Singing ""Wherever I Go""] Oh, yeah."
Here we are now.
Everything's about to change.
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday.
A chapter ending but the story is only just begun.
A page is turning for everyone.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
Wherever I go.
So excited I can barely even catch my breath.
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead.
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams.
And I know your heart is with me.
I hate airplanes.
I don't even know what keeps them up.
They're made out of sticks and bed sheets.
Why don't they just open up in two and drop Jimmy like a stone into water?
"That's right, Evelyn, you don't understand anything about it."
You've never done it.
You don't know why I do it.
So would you please just hold it down and let me think?
That's Capital Peak.
"Now, what's Edgar doing there?"
Easy.
Easy.
I'll give you another pill.
- You can't carry me all day.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
"- You can't, we both know that."
- I'm not gonna carry you.
You should just leave me here.
Go on ahead and if you find somebody send them back for me.
Just when I'm getting used to you?
- You mean that?
"- Yeah, I mean that."
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to make a travois.
The thing the Indians used to use to carry stuff around in the wintertime.
Pretty smart.
"Well, a pilot's gotta be."
"Put yourself down in a field someplace, it's up to you to get yourself out."
National Guard de Havillands got out after problems with their plumbing.
Why are you here?
I didn't call you.
"- Been thinking it over, Mr Moravia."
That was.
-.
That was...
There's nothing to move.
I...
I was...
I had a sunburn.
"Good night, sir."
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!
See and take in with your eyes all the beauty the ocean has to offer!
"As these new things come at you, you may not have seen them before, but be open to them and find the beauty within."
"Hey, buddy."
Yep.
Thanks a lot for bringing me to Problem Island.
What are we gonna do for an encore?
Talk about all the people that we slept with before we were married and really stir shit up?
What the hell are you talking about?
The therapist is trying to create a problem in my marriage that doesn't exist!
"Maybe he's not creating them, maybe he's just noticing them."
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't start with me.
I'm serious.
I don't need it.
"These are the best in the world at what they do, all right?"
"If Jeff Gordon told you that your oil was low, you might want to think about changing it."
"From the bucket, feed them!"
My therapist is kind of pushy.
Really?
Yeah.
"God, I like ours."
"Yeah, he said that Dave and I take each other for granted."
"That, you know, our relationship has become more like a job."
She was everything to me...
Everything.
Stanley is 22?
Yes.
"We were courting when Peggy found she was expecting, so, yes,"
I did the decent thing.
But that doesn't change anything.
I'd have married her anyway.
"I loved her, always did."
Were you aware of the changes your wife made to her will?
Spencer is a swine.
"I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen to me, and so now..."
Half the hotel.
How do you expect me to go on living when...
Everything I care about has been taken away from me?
Do you cure your own meat at the hotel?
What's that got to do with anything?
Would I be right in thinking that?
I don't know.
Yes.
Margaret was in charge of the kitchen.
Thank you.
"Christopher, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
"Sir Ernest bannerman, the mp at the white feather, he's managed to pull rank."
"He's made some phone calls, and the long and the short of it is I had to release the lot."
Ok.
They've all gone?
"Yes, they went this morning, except Spencer."
"He's here, and he wants to talk to you."
All right.
"How can I help you, Mr. Spencer?"
"You're holding my assistant, and unless you're going to charge him,"
"Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast."
"I gotta get back, gotta find my wife, you know?"
What do you got?
You see her?
That's my wife.
Jennifer?
Shane?
"God, Shane, there you are!"
I've been looking all over for you.
"Jennifer, what are you doing here?"
"Look, I heard at the salon that you were coming to this crazy singles' island, so I just felt a strong sense of urgency that you and I needed to talk before it was too late."
"Jennifer, you left me, remember?"
"I know, I know."
But then I was hoping that you would come after me.
It wasn't like you walked out of a bar!
It was a divorce.
And why are you even at this place?
Do you know this place is insane?
I'm getting called names.
"I've been called a cougar, a black panther, a puma!"
I had to smack this one kid.
That's the last time he'll walk up to a woman talking about cougar!
Yeah.
I've been looking all over the place for you.
And where have you been?
"Well, actually, I'm staying on the other side, the couples' side, with my girlfriend."
What?
Who?
Her name is Trudy and she's aspiring to be a manager.
Put it in my mouth!
"Go, go, go!"
Trudy?
That's what I meant.
it's crazy but I like it.
Bull.
I know you're a little upset about this poem thing. but--
"He said I could make $10,000 a night."
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand American dollars?
"Well, Bull, you're not serious about this?"
"You know, you people always assume you know what's best for me."
"Well, I'll tell you something, you don't."
Maybe it's time to shake up my life.
"Bull, you don't just become a wrestler overnight."
It takes a lot of time and training.
"If you decide to take up wrestling, you're gonna have to quit your job here."
"Now, I want you to take some time and really think about this."
okay-
I quit.
Oh.
He's not serious.
"Well, I mean, he'll cool down and then he'll change his mind."
I hope he's wearing boxer shorts.
[WOMAN SCREAMSI
Briefs.
This is ridiculous.
Bail reports don't just vanish into thin air.
Bull has been gone a week and this place has already turned upside down.
"Yeah, and it doesn't just stop with the paperwork."
It's open season on us in the courtroom.
"Well, word's out on the street Bull's gone."
Somebody's gotta keep order around here.
"Well, that's Dirk's job."
Hi. everybody.
Mm.
"In the time I have known you,"
I have always sensed you wanted to be a good man.
Do you want what happened to Thomas to ever happen again?
Of course not.
"Then go to Inspector Mallory, confess your crime and expose your superiors and the corrupt system that protected you."
"Father, I'm not sure that I'm brave enough."
I think you are.
God has given you the chance to salvage some greater good from your acts.
I strongly suggest that you do the right thing.
"Afternoon, sir."
Is the Inspector in?
"He is, sir, yes."
Go straight through.
Thank you.
"Oh, Sergeant, there's a man outside, he's behaving rather strangely."
I think he must be drunk.
Is there?
Right.
Thanks.
I've got nothing more to say.
Mrs Lightman?
Who are you?
I'm Max.
I am so very sorry... ..for what I did to Vera and to your son.
How did you get in here?
I want to confess to the murder of Vera Blanchett... ..and to my role in a barbaric police cover-up.
You what?
I should have known it was too good to be true.
"Come now, Mrs McCarthy."
Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.
And I didn't even get to taste the Dover sole.
Our torturers are very unhappy people.
They don't know what they are doing and are subjecting themselves to eternal suffering.
I'm living here and now and not elsewhere!
And God for me...
I beg your pardon.
If you don't believe in God what do you believe in?
I believe that there is God.
But he doesn't give a damn for me and my troubles!
Stop shouting!
I can't sleep.
It's time to go to sleep.
You had a rough day today.
"Solomon, your decisions frighten me."
The petitioner is right.
You're not building a road to God.
You're building a wall of fear.
Hundreds of people bow to me.
Fear is the only thing that makes them succumb to me and create something.
Piss faster!
Why are you jumping around like a drunken kangaroo?
He shoved me.
Who?
He... there he is sitting.
In black.
He is staring at me all the time.
Calm down.Tell me who is staring at you?
The man in black sitting on a toilet.
He is holding a piece of paper in his hand.
Close your eyes and touch your nose first with your right and then with your left hand.
Are you making an idiot out of me?
You do have problems.
Has it ever happened to you before?
-No need for gunplay here.
-l wouldn't be so sure.
YATES:
"This ain't your fight, mister."
-Who the hell are you?
-Name's Yates.
I'm a U.S. federal marshal.
Vin Tanner...
... you'reunderarrestfor murder in the sovereign state of Texas.
We've come to take you back.
Let's go.
"Marshal Yates, all I'm saying is that a man's actions should speak for him."
Couldn't agree more.
But I got papers say...
... thisfellowTanner'sactionsin Tascosa were that of a murderer.
Just because some papers say it doesn't make it true.
A lot of people will attest that Vin Tanner...
... hasriskedhislifemany times to protect this town.
"Mrs. Travis, I'm not the judge and I'm not the jury."
I'm not ever after that bounty on Tanner's head.
I'm just a lawman sworn to bring him to trial for the killing of Jess Kincaid.
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
"Marshal, you ever heard of a man by the name of Eli Joe?"
Should I?
He's wanted in Texas for the slaughter of two families.
"Well, what's that got to do with me?"
Tanner claims this Eli Joe set him up.
You know that for a fact?
Then what you have to say don't count for much.
MARY:
I'll wire the judge.
"You can do that, ma'am, but a territory judge..."
Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?
- Why would I do that?
"- Well, I asked you first"
"Look, don't underestimate Brooke."
She's full of surprises.
Its just part of her charm.
She told me to listen to track 13.
There are only 12 songs.
Honest mistake.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad."
I had no idea he was there.
It's cause he usually isn't.
I thought you were happy with your setup.
That's what I tell him.
"I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own, and how responsible I'm being even when I'm not."
"He loves his job, you know?"
"And after my mom died, it's just not fair to ask him to give that up."
But I miss him when he's away.
You tell him that?
He worries.
It's just better not to.
"So listen, I don't have a lot of quiet time these days."
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?
As long as you don't act out the parts.
Alright.
My mom said you wanted to see me.
Yeah.
"Hand me that ratchet, would you?"
So how are you holding up?
Why?
Are you going to report it back to my mom?
A Japanese that is active overseas.
"Today, we're in the popular chocolate shop in Paris, L'atelier de Bonheur."
"Ah, it's Bonheur."
"Geez, I want to go to Paris."
I want to eat Bonheur chocolates.
"No matter where you get them, chocolates won't be much different, right?"
"What are you saying, onee-chan?"
It's totally different.
(T/N: onee-chan means older sister)
Bonheur is special.
"And in this place that's called the world's best chocolate shop, there is a Japanese employee."
Hee...
- It's been six years since he came alone to Paris.
"Built up his expertise, the young chocolatier Koyurugi Souta."
Making chocolates in Bonheur was my dream.
- No way.
"But next week, I will be returning to Japan, and opening my own shop."
"Chocolates that won't lose to the taste of Bonheur,"
I want to let the Japanese people enjoy them.
"Then, I'll be taking it."
- Yes.
"Wow, it's as pretty as a picture."
As expected of the prince of chocolate.
Not at all.
"Ever since I came back to Japan, there's been nothing but good things."
"Dad accepted the renovation of the shop without any complaints, thanks to Bonheur's reputation, for good or bad, right after I landed in japan,"
I even got the label of prince of chocolate.
Take care.
Ah...
Excuse me.
Souta-kun.
See.
What happened to the Poncherello School of Cool?
"Well, I'm always open for suggestions, Jon."
"Go up to her and say, ""Hey, my name is Frank and I'd like to get to know you. "" Take it from there, just be honest."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm gonna let her discover me.
I'll put these on and go outside and polish my bike.
"Chicks can't resist a nice, shiny bike."
And me in these shorts.
There she is.
I can't see her feet.
Got it.
Dalecki's Baby Food.
One of my officers?
Loose load cite?
"Not so far, but we'll check right into it."
"Yes, sir, we'll start an immediate search for the two boxes."
Right.
15-5 Mary L.A.
"11-82, southbound Harbor freeway at Exposition."
"15-7, Mary L.A."
"11-79, northbound Hollywood Freeway at Vermont."
Attention all units we are requesting all area agencies to assist in the search for two boxes of contaminated baby food.
"The boxes were lost on the Golden State, southbound, near Ninth."
The food is contaminated with botulism.
"Repeat, botulism."
I can't find the blue one.
Which goes best with these shorts?
Come on.
You're not going to a fashion show.
- You're going to meet a girl.
"- Yeah, maybe I don't need a shirt."
Just tell me what you need.
All right?
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA!
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead!"
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you, it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney."
You go grab a flyswatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"
"We're not killing Badger, yo!"
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
I mean.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, but he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognize your cough.
Take that mask off.
Get some air.
Go on.
Take it easy!
"Breathe in, breathe out."
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
'Cause I got bad knees.
That's better.
Ok.
There's some good stuff here.
"You know, a little kid that's staying over at the motel found this medallion."
"I thought it was yours, but I see you're wearing yours."
Where did you find that?
A little kid found it in the RV.
That's not mine.
I see that.
That's Stu's.
"Well, give it back to him."
"Oh, Stu's going to be happy about this."
Look at that.
Where do you think that came from?
- I don't know--
- See the work in that?
Think anybody does anything like that these days?
You know how much that's worth?
You know what gold is these days?
You know where it's going?
[chuckles] Nobody knows where it's going.
"I'll tell ya, people are gettin' the fever for it now."
Everybody's looking for it.
"Everybody wants it, everybody's after it."
"You know, you could help me, if you would, you and Stu."
Sure.
"I got to go back over to the gulley and look around, and you guys know that country better than anybody."
"I thought maybe if you'd ride over with me and help me look around, we might come up with something."
"- Well, you want to go look around?"
- Yeah.
"Sure, that's no problem."
- The kid's at the motel?
- Yeah.
What's his name?
That's just how life is though.
- A marvelous woman with a marvelous voice and a marvelous song.
Nora and the Pope dancers!
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
I'll play along for a little while.
To take advantage of this would be wise.
As long as I'm a part of the game.
"- If I were to leave, I wouldn't know where to go."
"If I order a schnitzel, she says I'm too fat."
I should get myself something vegetarian.
Why is it my mother's business what I eat?
- I don't get involved with her life.
I don't tell her what she should and shouldn't eat.
You also have a mother who's sticking her nose in everything?
... for such a long time.
Shall I leave?
- It couldn't do any harm to have men and money on your side.
"Here, just give her a ten."
She doesn't need money.
What's with you!
?
Why are you taking my money?
What are you doing here?
He shouldn't be giving her money.
She doesn't need money!
"Please, goodbye, and thank you."
Here comes another one.
That was Nora and the Pope dancers!
"Now, ladies and gentlemen..."
"And now, yet another dream comes true."
- It's finally here!
What we've all been waiting for.
Yes.
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorrah!
A fellow potato-eater.
My real name's McGill.
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
"They all want a pipe-hittin' member of the tribe, so to speak."
I digress.
Good things are happening.
"Fact is, your nephew's gonna get out in no time."
That's wonderful.
"There's still a few details to be ironed out, but now that the DEA is involved,"
I think he's looking at time served and probation.
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"Excuse me, the DEA?"
Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
"I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news, but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers."
I understand that.
But what does that have to do with the DEA?
"They're after some mystery man, some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg."
They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up!"
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Look, look."
I think...
I just think that we should
"I love you, Buddy."
[Sniffles] I love you.
[Whispers] I love you.
Where are they?
"Dick, you don't have to make a statement."
Herb covered 'em foryou.
No!
"[Herb] Gentlemen, Mr. Nixon is a man who is graceful in defeat, and if he was here with us..."
[Reporters Shouting]
"Can I have some quiet, please?"
[Shouting Continues]
Give the- just a second.
I
"Can I have some quiet, please?"
Quiet!
- Thank you.
I - [Reporters Quiet]
- [Reporter] Mr. Nixon.
I
- Uh-[Clears Throat]
"- I believe Governor Brown has a heart, - [Shutters Clicking]"
Even though he believes I do not.
"Uh, I believe he's a good American, even though he feels I am not."
I'm proud ofthe fact that I defended my opponent's patriotism.
"Uh, you gentlemen didn't report it, but I'm proud that I did that."
"And I would appreciate it, for once, if you would just printwhat I say."
"[Nervous Chuckle] Uh, for 16 years, uh, ever since the Hiss case, you've had a lotoffun."
A lotoffun.
"But recognize you have a responsibility, if you're againstthe candidate, to give him the shaft."
"But ifyou do that, at least put one lonely reporteron the campaign... who will report whatthe candidate says now and then."
"Uh, I think, all in all, I've given as good as I've taken."
"Butas I leave you, I w..."
"We take a dog, tie him to a bicycle..."
No!
It's just not good enough!
Mom's home early!
"You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite, youdonotspit,youdonot eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!"
A lifetime ban from Gymboree!
A lifetime ban!
I can't believe it.
She didn't even see the board.
This is a sign we were meant to have this.
"We were meant to do something really, really great with you."
It'll come.
We just have to be patient.
No!
This is Mommy's purse!
You can't have it!
"Please, it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!"
Lois...
"Well, he has a million toys."
Why does he only want to take my things?
"Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally."
He doesn't understand what he's doing.
He's just a baby.
"Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes, he'll get tired of it."
You're right.
"I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him, he'd see it as a sign of weakness."
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- Yeah.
"Here, sweetie."
Mommy's purse.
"You can have that for five minutes, okay?"
I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.
"Hey, Ken."
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.
Yeah.
Where's my money?
Your friend was late four hours last week.
And he's late again today.
I see... go have a talk with him.
The talk is happening right now.
You're going nowhere until Clive gets here.
"# Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #"
# 'Cause he was fast on his feet #
# And he was quick with his fists If he had trouble in the streets #
# But when his old man would hit the bottle #
# He'd kick Conejo's ass #
# And with a wounded heart Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #
"# Run, Conejo, run #"
"Never seen no speed limit on this road, Sheriff Kilbaught, so I... so I made a... a modest estimate."
"Never been anything modest about your modesty, Clive."
"This truck don't go a mile over 50, Sheriff."
"Now, you were driving a different truck this morning."
"I've been watching you the last few weeks, driving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"Now, we both know there ain't nothing in this town worth taking a second look at."
Yeah.
"That against the law now, Sheriff?"
"Okay, come on, out."
Even your mama thinks you're a piece of shit.
You don't belong here.
You got me thinking.
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?
"And by ""champagne"" I mean wine, and by ""bottle"" I mean box."
"Uh, you know what?"
We'll take it here.
Would there happen to be a 7 Eleven Merlot?
"Max, wine in our room sounds so much better."
We can relax and focus on each other for once.
"Mm, great."
What's the room number?
Oh.
I think she means oh-six.
I don't think so.
That room is still an active crime scene.
"Stowaways, huh?"
I'll have the Coast Guard come and pick you up.
They're already coming for that guy.
I didn't wanna strip my clothes off and try to drive the boat.
It was that voodoo curse.
"Damn you, Tim!"
"Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend."
I can tell that you're telling the truth.
"Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out."
We'll do anything.
"Well, she will."
I'll do over the shirt stuff.
Your shirt.
If you take off that hat.
Is there anywhere in the world where I don't have to be a waitress?
Hooters?
Thanks.
I'm a cocktail waitress on the Mississippi River.
This is a worse vacation than the one with Ed Helms in it.
"Sorry, sir."
"Uh, Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend."
They're here to take publicity photos with the team.
You're police.
Did Joey do something wrong?
NG:
"No, we just..."
We're clearing up a misunderstanding.
"Hey, why don't you, uh, go hang out with the team, okay?"
I'll be right there.
"So, you were talking about why you were angry with O.G."
Right.
"Yeah, I was angry with him."
But I had no reason to kill him.
I won.
Tendu signed with Team ProFine.
"Now, O.G. was furious, okay?"
"He kept badgering Tendu to change his mind, but..."
Something wrong?
"Tendu was supposed to be here by now, for the publicity photos."
"Called him, like, an hour ago, but he didn't answer."
"Wait, you don't think whoever tried to kill O.G."
"went after him, also?"
We can't rule anything out.
You know where he was staying?
I could send a car to check on him.
"We need to talk to him, too."
"I don't know for sure, but I bet he was at the same hotel as O.G."
There was only one room registered under O.G.'s name.
Then try looking under Tendu's real name.
I only learned it when we were drawing up the contracts.
It's Marcel Otolik.
O-T-O-L-I-K.
She won the money.
Maybe they have joint bank accounts.
"Yeah, or maybe he wants Craig for something else."
You know what?
Freeze their accounts.
"I want thorough backgrounds on Dawkins, Craig and Dana."
Run their names through NCIC.
"Chin, what about the phone you found?"
Dawkins got it from the car he stole.
But the call history was erased.
"He must have made some phone calls, reached out to the phone company and sure enough, two calls were made right after the escape."
The first one went to a local woman named Sofia Archuleta.
Archuleta.
"That's, uh, Dawkins girlfriend."
Warden said she's a regular visitor.
She's the first one he's going to for help.
What about the other call?
"That one was made to a local lightweight ex-con by the name of Makani Huku, they spoke for three minutes."
"Kono, follow up on the call with Makani, find out what they were talking about."
"Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket."
See if we find any links on Dana and Craig.
Easy.
- We need to get an address for Sofia.
I'll get it.
You should change your shirt.
You look like an animal.
"You should go apologize to your sister, she's been sitting there for five hours."
"Thanks, buddy."
I'll take it from here.
"Mary, I'm sorry."
You okay?
Yeah.
Yes.
For three points.
"No he's not, is it?"
Yes!
Who is he?
Benedict.
"He was the last one, Benedict."
Your answers?
Ratzinger and Benedict.
Show me your first letters.
Yeah...
And that one?
I guess so?
Let's see if you're right?
"Correct, for two points."
"Now there's something rather interesting about Pope Benedict and the current Pope, do you know what it is?"
He's the last one to resign for a long time.
For about 600 years.
"And so you have a situation where we have a Pope who's resigned, and you've also got a Pope, who's Pope Francis."
So Pope Benedict is now known as Pope Emeritus.
"So for the first time in about 600 years, we have two popes who are alive at the same time."
"Right, where are we at the end that round?"
"Lutrophiles, eight points, very well done."
"Araucarians, you're on four."
"It's round two, and you'll each face two hives containing three answers relating to a specific topic."
You've 45 seconds to complete each hive and score a maximum five points.
"So Team Lutrophiles, you're in the lead, you get to choose first from..."
"So, choose your topic first of all."
Physics or Geography?
Geography could be a lot of things.
Shall we go with physics?
OK.
I think we all need to take a moment.
Mr. Campbell-- looks like I found one dumb enough not to.
"- Mr. Campbell, I think if you sit down again..."
- No!
I think that we could all...
"What the hell are you doing, man?"
- He doesn't have a case.
"- Maybe, maybe not but he's the client."
"Yeah, well, he was pushing my buttons."
I don't care if he punched you in the face.
"Look, we're both trying to make partner here, Adam."
All right?
"I haven't said anything to you before this because... it was none of my business, but now you're making it my business because it's affecting me."
"- So what's your point, Jimmy?"
- We both know this is about you and Brian.
"Now you don't want to talk to me, that's fine."
"But, uh, talk to somebody before you ruin both of our careers."
Just a minute.
I'm coming!
- It's me.
Thank god you're here.
I have no idea what to wear and...
Hi.
Did you read my mind?
No.
These are just the maternity clothes that you lent me.
"Well, I don't need them back."
I'm not gonna have a baby anytime.
Ever.
I-I don't need them.
I--I'm going for a more...
- Classic look.
What else?
Checking account shows one charge last night at Sposare's Pizza in Baltimore just before 3:00 a.m.
"Pizza and beer-- that's a hell of a last meal, right, bo...?"
Go.
"Boss, we may have a situation."
That was the ship's commander.
All 215 sailors reported back for duty this morning.
"All except Petty Officer Adams and this man... 21-year-old Petty Officer Brian Smith, from Virginia."
Maybe a second victim?
Or maybe involved.
No way to know that yet.
Figure it out.
Go on.
"Hey, I'm just grateful for this time of year."
"Liberty Week, the sales almost double my regular day."
But you do not remember ever seeing
Petty Officer Adams this morning?
No.
"It's a real shame about that kid, but no."
I-I never saw him.
"I mean, look around."
"Not exactly easy telling 'em apart, you know."
"I think it was Mae West who said,"
"""You've seen one sailor's anchor, you've seen 'em all."""
"No, I just kind of meant that it gets hectic in here."
"You know, all of 'em in here at once."
A bunch of 'em all yelling for service.
"Anyone get out of control, start a fight?"
"Oh, no, nothing like that."
"No, no, these are all good kids."
I-I never had any trouble.
Are you guys here about Caleb?
"So, anyway..."
It's really great to see you again.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you too."
Then...
You're happy?
Yeah.
"Like you said, It's all good."
"It's just... kinda hard knowing that I'm not even 30, and the greatest thing that will ever happen to me already happened."
"You take care of yourself, okay?"
Am I... the best thing that's ever happened to you?
"Baby, come on."
'Course you are.
- Really?
- Sure.
You're not counting playing in the Super Bowl.
"I mean, come on."
It's the Super Bowl.
But you're definitely number two.
"Oh, wait."
There's that million-dollar check I got for putting my name on that stupid barbeque grill.
That didn't suck.
"So it goes Super Bowl, big check, then you."
Dinner at the White House...
"When I was planning this party, I kept looking at these kids."
"And they're all smiling, and happy, and hopeful, and..."
"I kept thinking, ""How many of these kids are happy today?"""
I would say... all the ones who didn't come to this party.
I'm serious.
There were 28 of us in the class.
"How many of us are already, like, stuck in lousy jobs, or bad marriages?"
How many of us have already made that one big dumb choice we'll never really recover from?
- Buying myself a piñata.
- A personal piñata?
"End of a hard week, you just string up a piñata, whack the crap out of it, and it rains candy on you."
- It's the best.
- But I don't understand.
"Cookie, you were also buying a piñata?"
"Yeah, I mean, what are the odds, right?"
When two people who both love piñatas find each other?
Very unexpected.
"'Cause, you know, normally I date, you know, really tough guys, right?"
- It's what I would assume.
"- Yeah, bounty hunters,"
"MMA fighters, and large animal vets, but, man, none of those guys made me laugh like this man."
- You're a party in a bottle.
- There's no denying that.
"And the physical part is just... it's, um... seamless."
"When you say ""seamless,"" what do you mean by..."
"- Well, we need more apps."
- You don't know where his body
- ends and yours begins?
- You guys need more apps?
- Is that what it is?
"- I do, yeah."
- Who wants more apps?
"- I'm good, thanks."
I'll get you some then.
"Oh, my God, can you believe it?"
"We thought Nancy was gonna be some terrible woman who was like, ""my Crock-Pot,"" and instead, it's Cookie!"
- [laughs]
- You must be so psyched.
"- I am so psyched, really."
"- Oh, God, imagine what."
"Okay, good."
I think we just solved a murder.
The sun is in our eyes and in our hearts even when it's night and when it's dark.
"The moon still glows, the stars still shine,"
Now and forever until the end of time.
What do you think?
I think you need to dig deeper.
What does that mean?
I can't tell you that.
"It's just, like, part of the journey."
"You look pretty, Mama."
"Thank you, baby."
"I'm gonna go get my notebook, okay?"
I wrote more poems.
That's great.
"So, keep an eye on Jess and Naomi, shut down any fist fights, and..."
"Yeah, I shouldn't be too late."
So are you still in business?
"As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings."
I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation.
What do you mean?
I want in.
We could be partners.
I already have a partner.
"Well, then I'll be your receptionist."
It doesn't work like that.
"Mary, I need a career change, and we'd make a great team."
"Let's talk about this later, shall we?"
You need me.
I love you.
"Hey, where are you going, anyway?"
A funeral.
You can't just give your sperm to two girls you met in a cafe.
I met you in a cafe.
I just feel like you shouldn't be doing this.
The world is overpopulated.
You know there's an island of plastic the size of Texas in the pacific.
"I know, Leah."
You told me this 1000 times.
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying.
Overpopulation is important to me.
"Look, I don't think that me giving these lesbians one illegitimate child is gonna add that much plastic."
You have two children.
Why can't I have one?
But you haven't thought this through.
You don't listen to me.
I do listen.
I've heard everything you've said.
Really?
You don't listen listen.
I want you to go for therapy.
"Oh, God."
I'll trade you therapy for sex.
It's been almost three weeks.
I think it's sweet you know how long it's been.
Let's get a drink.
- Keep an eye out for Jarmusch.
- There's a lot of good-looking women... much better than at book parties.
Goodbye.
- White wine?
- Yeah.
Why is it wherever I go I look for Suzanne?
Because your heart's broken.
You're looking for the piece that is her to put it back together.
Why is that lady rubbing on someone else's body?
Yoon Jae!
Da Ran...
You came?
Hello.
I came to see Yoon Jae.
What are you thinking coming here by yourself without saying anything?
!
I had no idea that he was a doctor!
And I came to see my body!
Your body?
"What, you don't think I'd be curious to see if my body's doing okay?"
And there's a precious personal item that I have to find too!
Then...
Follow me this way.
Hurry up and put this on.
"But, Teacher Gil..."
"There's a girl doctor among his friends, right?"
She's a little strange.
There's something weird about her touch.
Kang Gyung Joon.
You made my Yoon Jae be called an idiot...
Now you're even trying to get him to be called sneaky?
Sneaky?
!
Boys your age...
"I understand that when a girl even lays a finger on you, you think it's a turn-on."
Since I'm a high school teacher.
"But if you look at Yoon Jae's friend in that way with Yoon Jae's eyes, what do you think she'll think of my Yoon Jae?"
There's your disillusion growing again!
"You know very well boys my age are more likely to act out the more you act like that, right teacher?"
"Idiotic, sneaky and now incapable..."
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilde's having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Am I to tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
"Mr.Zuloaga tried to dissuade him, but Benigno wouldn't listen, he was very upset."
He also said he knew a lot of married couples who didn't get along half as well as he and Alicia.
"JORDAN, EIGHT MONTHS LATER"
"Lydia Gonzalez was buried yesterday, April 13, in the Almudena cemetery."
"The 33-year-old bullfighter, daughter of Antonio Gonzalez, had been in a coma since..."
"""The Forest"" Clinic."
May I speak to Benigno Martin?
He's on the 2nd floor.
- He doesn't work here anymore.
"- Excuse me, miss..."
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- And Nurse Rosa?
- Who's calling?
"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."
"OK, so what's the population, hmm?"
"12,000, 15,000?"
"OK, so what's the population, hmm?"
"12,000, 15,000?"
'Course they know each other.
'Course they know each other.
What's the first thing a good copper does
"What's the first thing a good copper does when he moves to a new town, Warwick?"
"when he moves to a new town, Warwick?"
Shakes everybody's hand.
Shakes everybody's hand.
"But this is Griffith, Phil."
Bloody heartland of the cannabis industry.
"But this is Griffith, Phil."
Bloody heartland of the cannabis industry.
"Coppers take money to look the other way, you know that."
"Coppers take money to look the other way, you know that."
So what are you saying?
Malcolm's involved in Mackay's disappearance?
So what are you saying?
Malcolm's involved in Mackay's disappearance?
Or murder.
Maybe.
Or murder.
Maybe.
"I don't know, but I know I don't bloody trust him."
"I don't know, but I know I don't bloody trust him."
Who was it that pointed us to Trimbole?
Who was it that pointed us to Trimbole?
"Well, since he's Trimbole's alibi,"
"Well, since he's Trimbole's alibi, maybe he thought it was worth the risk."
"I thought I had lost him, but maybe Malvado can sense me getting closer."
"Wait, he can sense you?"
"He's a Lord, Richard."
He made me.
"So he can get inside your head, like you do to me?"
Worse.
"Well, can he sense other culebras?"
- Can he sense me?
- I don't know.
"I thought I knew what Malvado could do, but I guess I'm not so sure."
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to find out."
[Malvado] Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"After all these years, only la diosa could come between you."
- [speaks Spanish]
- I don't speak Spanish.
"She's the sweetest kind of poison, the kind you crave."
She's the reason that my uncle is dead.
"True, and yet you, me,"
"Carlos, Richard, we're all fools for her."
No.
"I may be a selfish, backstabbing piece of shit, but I don't dig on your snake princess."
"I do, however, recognize her value."
I want ten million cash and a guarantee that you and your culebra cronies will never bother me or my girl ever again.
How do I know you even have her?
Figured you'd ask. [Whistles]
Give it to me.
[inhales deeply]
Your brother must be furious.
"Oh, I wouldn't worry about him."
He's just whipped.
Don't I know you somehow?
"I, uh..."
"Well, no man ever died more convenient to a grave."
You're sure that we're doing the right thing?
I think it's best.
Best for you.
I guess so.
"""Have Gun Will Travel"""
Reads the card of a man
A knight without armor in a savage land
His fast gun for hire
Heeds the calling wind
A soldier of fortune
Is the man called Paladin
"Paladin, Paladin, where do you roam?"
"Paladin, Paladin, far, far from home"
## [theme]
[Man] And so that is just like I told you.
[laughter]
"All right, all right!"
Now listen some more!
Already it is 30 years since I came here from Copenhagen to start my shop.
I do not marry.
I put my heart in my hands and shape the wood.
"People like, and I make the shop bigger and bigger, and I put more and more men to work."
"Good men, all of you."
The best.
"Old friends, I know what is in your heads."
You want to know why I stop you from work to talk to you like this.
"I think everybody that knows Axel Norstaad knows my dream that someday, here in our little Danish part of the Valley, we have our own Children's Hospital."
"And now, at last,"
I find a way to make this dream to be fulfilled.
- Dad hated jelly beans.
- He liked the cherry ones.
- He said they taste like cough syrup.
The only candy your father really liked is Almond Joy.
Don't ask me why.
"But get what you want, get what you want."
Not if Dad hated them.
Yael.
What was Dad like before he met Mom?
"He didn't smell as good, but he was the golden boy to my black sheep."
"He did everything right, a mother's dream."
"Hardworking, athletic, ambitious."
"That wasn't getting him laid, so he went through a tortured-artist phase."
- Where are his paintings?
"- No, no, no, not that kind of artist."
A performance artist.
He did weird stuff like paint his whole body silver and stand naked on the war memorial reciting bad poetry.
- Why?
- To get laid.
"It worked, too."
He met your mom when he hired her to dance barefoot in his Feet Me in St. Louis installation.
But he was always broke.
"It wasn't really his true nature, and your mom wanted kids."
"So he took his engineering degree, got a real job, moved to suburbia."
I'm never getting married.
It's death.
You're a little young to have reached that conclusion.
"How come you're not married, Uncle Andy?"
'Cause it's death.
Right here.
Here we go.
So Elaine Roberts' brother owns Green Grass Landscaping?
"I'll keep my eyes closed, I promise."
"He's such a good man, isn't he?"
'I wanted to get Lena's things quickly and get back to the house.
"'I don't know what it was - a feeling, I guess - 'but I was bothered by something."
'Maybe I just didn't trust Higgins with her.
"'Anyway, I'd feel better the sooner I got back to the estate."
"'What I really didn't like was invading the privacy of their home, 'especially since I knew what they'd experienced in the past."
"'I felt strange going through Lena's things, which was silly."
'I'd seen this kind of stuff before.
"'Well, most of it, anyhow."
"'If I couldn't take Saul back to her, 'l could at least take back a pleasant memory.'"
We don't know what we're up against.
This was taken in Suez with my messmates.
"That was in 1946, right after the war."
Karl.
It's dark.
She must be in the main house.
With how many others?
I only have four shots.
Don't worry.
That'll be enough.
"The pictures are wonderful, Higgins."
But I have such a headache.
Do you mind?
"Oh, how inconsiderate of me."
You must be exhausted.
Can I get you anything?
An aspirin?
Some chicken soup?
You're so kind.
Thank you.
Just a little rest.
"Yeah, that's a bite mark, all right."
"What do you have to say about that, maestro?"
Gillian must have given me a love bite.
I spent the night with her Sunday.
"Yeah, she told us that."
She also said that you both fell asleep fully clothed.
We had rather a lot to drink.
I took my usual sleeping pill.
My recollection is a little fuzzy.
That's cold.
Teeth marks look bigger than Laura's.
"Well, that happens when there's some swelling of the bite wound."
There.
I'll get the odontologist to confirm.
But it's a match with Laura.
"He clenched her in a bear hug and... lifted her up into the air shaft, her head would have been over his shoulder."
It's consistent with a bite sustained during a struggle.
I hear the fat lady warming up.
"Me, a suspect."
- How outrageous is that?
- I'm sure it's a mistake.
It's done.
You're perfect.
"I'm all bark, Gillian."
You know I wouldn't hurt anyone.
That's the last thing I would want to think.
"But truthfully, Philip, I..."
I don't remember biting you.
You know how much we had to drink.
I just wanted to numb myself.
"Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
Mr. Reinhardt... put your hands on the piano.
Right.
"Maybe I didn't have a fluorescent suntan, but I'd spent my share of time in pool halls as a kid."
"Of course, that was a long time ago."
- Straight pool?
- Mm-hmm.
"Gee, I haven't played since I learned for Roger."
"In Bayonne, girls in their late 20s, or early 30s, still do that for their men."
Roger and I met playing pool.
I felt this... attraction to him and asked him to teach me.
"When someone's showing you the game, there's a lot of... touching and being close."
"Well, by the end of the evening, he'd asked me out."
It was just like in the movies.
You know what I mean?
I think I can guess.
Excuse me.
"Well, just when I know he's about ready to pop the question, he disappears."
- Ah.
"- Almost a year later, I get this postcard from him... with this P.O. box postmark, you know?"
"Once the writing started again, we burned up the post office."
"I mean torrid, you know?"
"And then, bam!"
A marriage proposal.
Excuse me.
"Well, I was so excited I couldn't sleep for two nights."
And then I telegraphed.
"""Yes. '."""
"And then yesterday, when I got off the plane..."
No Roger.
That's 24 hours you owe me.
Rack 'em up.
Well?
"Well, we do what we have to do."
(BRANCHES BREAKING)
Stop there.
Throw down your weapons.
We're screwed.
Maquis.
And who are they?
These are some assholes.
"Say that again, if you've got the balls."
You are assholes.
Fine.
You asked for it.
(Shoots a blank)
"You're the asshole, who cheats at cards."
"You couldn't beat me at cards if you wore a hood, Mariano."
You know each other?
"Yeah, they also work for the Ministry."
"So, you mean that all this is a joke."
"Yeah, we do it to all the new guys, like you."
Interesting sense of humor you have.
If we don't have a little fun now and then this will be the death of us.
"Come on, let's go."
Not a damn bit funny.
We're almost there.
Are you sure that the translator won't show up in Hendaye?
I took care of him.
"He'll spend a few weeks glued to the toilet,"
I assure you.
Why do I never get to seduce a beautiful woman instead of greasy lechers?
For the same reason we're going to see Hitler and not Ava Gardner.
"Look, her I did meet, but I must be the only one who doesn't brag about it."
Hitler.
There have been too many assholes in this world and I've met a lot of them.
And no one seems to notice I'm so full of shit.
"Like, this one woman was just eating it up."
"And, on one hand, I felt relieved 'cause, you know, I was getting away with it."
But at the same time...
I felt such... contempt for her.
And then things started really getting bad.
The words I was saying didn't even sound like words anymore.
"And then the walls started making that noise, and I just had to get out of there."
"So I'm sitting in my car, and I'm just......"
Just trying to breathe.
And it's like I'm...
I'm breathing ink.
And then I become the ink.
"I'm like this me-shaped bag of black, viscous ink."
"And even now, as I'm talking to you,"
I still feel...
Kind of gelatinous.
And I'm consumed with an unbearable self-loathing.
And I can hear the furniture whispering.
Maybe we should try adjusting your medication again.
Maybe.
I'm guessing either Carol or Willie Nelson was here.
That bad?
Not if you're in a reggae band.
"So, listen, I, um..."
I'm thinking of staying at my place tonight.
What?
No.
I'll just open some windows.
It's not that.
I just think...
It might be easier if I'm in my place.
I am putting you two on it.
As captains?
"Or should I say, crap-tains?"
"Hey, everybody!"
I got spinning wheels for Barbara's carriage.
Now's it's not just her attitude that's gangster.
"Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?"
I'm trying to set up my new wireless headphones.
Gonna make my walkman sound amazing.
This is ridiculous.
"I'm trying to keep things on the down-low, and you three went on the biggest shopping spree since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Wait a minute.
"Han, why are you taller than the counter?"
Just been eating right and getting enough sleep.
"Yeah, something's weird."
You're almost the height of an adult penguin.
Fine!
I treated myself to lifts.
I was sick of being nose to butt with everyone on the subway.
Check out Caroline's Instagram.
Looks like they're in more trouble than I was the last time I tried to put on overalls.
"Ooh, they're on a tugboat filled with toilets, and she writes, ""Help."
"Please send money."""
So... quick unfollow?
Or sleep on it and pow-wow in the morning?
No.
We have to help them.
I lost the cord to these headphones anyway.
"Oh, still got toilet boat legs."
"Ugh, this place reeks of bait."
"Oh, no, wait."
We're not going to sleep.
We're not?
Mmm-mmm.
What we gonna do in there?
For real?
So how was your night?
My husband found himself in a very traumatic shark situation.
Here we go.
"As we were planning to go to the waterfall and have a romantic evening, because, as you know, we don't do that very often because of the kids and work..."
"But somehow, this crazy, traumatic shark experience was enough to make him neglect his wife."
"Ronnie, nice to meet you."
Well said.
"David, how did that make you feel?"
I know my truth.
Excuse me?
I know my truth.
"Did you say, ""l know my truth',?"
"Oh, boy."
"Listen, I'm telling you, you getting on my last nerve!"
"Yo, I didn't sign up for this!"
"Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing."
You said we was gonna be partying.
You said we was gonna be doing what we do.
"You made promises, Daddy."
"Boo-Boo, look, they got me doing a lot of activities."
What do you expect from me?
I'm tired.
You tired?
"Yo, I'm tired."
"Plain and simple, I ain't having it."
"Sometimes we forget how to do the easiest thing in the world, which is just to talk to each other."
"Okay, let's start here."
That's not dumb.
That's cute.
"Look, I don't know who my dad is."
And...
"If I stop believing that anything is possible, it feels like I'm shutting the door on ever meeting him."
Can I stop making this face?
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna cry.
"Well, your crying face is dumb, too, so go ahead."
I'll end it with Everett.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just curious.
Why Egypt?
I figure it's so far away that no one will ever follow me there.
"Seriously, you know Riley Elliott?"
Yeah.
We dated for six months.
"We're on a break right now, but you never know."
Hmm.
You've blocked my entire life's work!
You ruined my career!
Whoa.
"I just think that you have some incredible skills, Mary, and I would love to see you channel those talents into something good."
Oh.
"For your information,"
I have done a lot of good!
Did you know that I was the number one download for Operation Desert Freedom?
What have you ever done for our troops?
I was really nice to one in an airport shuttle one time.
"Okay, if you want to help me, Aaron, then just let me be who I am."
Accept me for who I am.
Not a lot of people in my life have done that.
A magic trick?
"- Yeah, I'm talking about a magic trick."
- No.
I used to do it during college exams.
"I can make it appear, I can make it disappear."
We can't risk giving him another agent as a hostage.
We have to do something.
"- All right, Reid, let's go."
Teach it to me.
- What?
No.
"Look, if you can do it, I can do it."
Show it to me.
I've been practicing this my whole life.
We have less than 30 minutes.
"Reid, I am not about to let you get on that train with an armed psychotic."
"We don't have any other choice, do we?"
No.
We don't have any other choice.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
I don't understand any of it.
"Oh, he worked for the government for several years in the '80s."
Probably the source of his delusions.
He's been institutionalized for the past nine years.
Until Dr. Deaton took him on a field trip.
Yeah.
What we need is a strategy.
- I'll try to talk to him.
- You think that's wise?
TheWorstof theWorst
"It's her, right?"
Give me the phone now.
No Jik!
Thepersonyouare tryingtocall-
What's wrong?
I told you to give me that girl's number.
"No matter how you look at it, she's messing with a student."
Is Sin Joon Young that great?
Yeah he is.
This girl isn't that weird either.
She's normal but Joon Young is so awesome that he's even able to change her.
I'm not saying that right now.
Don't fall for Joon Young.
-What?
-If your always around him filling the documentary then you'll definitely fall for him.
This rascal...
You dont know Jin Joon.
Joon Young is know a person in a different world now.
Joon Young's saying something without thought.
Don't be mistaken and don't get any useless hope.
You'll get hurt.
Did you eat something wrong this morning?
That's right.
"Those ribs must have tasted weird, right?"
"So that's why I told you to stay away from them and not to eat them, you punk!"
"Noona, I hope you and Hyung will have nice courtship."
Even if he doesn't have anything he's a really good person and you fit with him.
That's the way that you'll be happy.
Then this is the end of my nagging.
No Euly!
Film the documentary well.
Well...
We'll think about it.
"Well, how about this:"
Whoever gets out of their beanbag first gets what they want?
"Everyone, you are now free to date people in the office."
"Our not very long, extremely local nightmare is over."
"Hey, you got the ban lifted?"
Yeah... isn't that what you wanted?
Only when it was never going to happen!
I lied before.
"I am scurred, I am..."
I'm just a big ol' scurredy cat.
"I just, I really don't want to mess this up with Emma."
"Look, I know more about women than anyone except Gloria Steinem and John Mayer."
"I've picked up women in nine languages, and I only know five."
"As Jack Gordon, colon, Man of Action... copyright pending..."
I'm going to help you ask out Emma.
"Okay, I will gladly accept your help."
And I'm going to start a binder right now
- with some subsections and...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
You are not going to overthink this.
"My plan has one step, and that's called ""taking action""..."
Emma!
Clark has something he'd like to ask you.
No.
"Hey, Emma, I was just wondering... [laughing]:"
"Hey, it's Clark, from work."
What's up?
"Pretty good, pretty good."
[muttering]
I just wanted to know if maybe you want to hung out sometime?
Come on.
Will you stop it?
Jesse will be here any minute and I need to practice.
Or you could not tell him and before you know it.
We're off to college together sharing a dorm room.
Where I have to listen to you complainin' about how bad you feel.
For not coming clean to Jesse and there's no place for me to hide.
Because I'm trapped with you in a 12-by-12 foot concrete cell.
That's filled with tear-soaked tissues dripping in snot!
"On second thought, yeah, maybe you should tell him."
Well that was a long trip for nothing.
How long have you known me?
Point taken.
[Doorbell ringing]
Now get out of here.
No hang on.
If you're gonna tell him about Hannah.
I should tell him about Lola.
Lilly no one...
Cares!
I get it.
I get it.
"Wow, I really want to tell you you get more beautiful."
Every time I see you.
But that'd be going against my brooding rocker image.
So I'm just gonna say: hey.
That works for me.
"Oh, sweet niblets, can't you at least warn a guy?"
Good thing I got that Smokey and the Bandit marathon running on cable.
You sounded a little nervous on the phone.
Is everything okay?
[Sighs] I'm fine.
What's garbage like you doing with garbage like this?
"Come on, open her up."
"It's the only job I can get, seeing as how people are so damn discriminant... against those who have paid their dues."
Discriminant?
"Hell of a word there, Clive."
But it ain't your word.
"What did you do with the other truck, huh?"
You're gonna start walking...
Hey.
"What you got there, boy?"
You spit that out.
Spit it out!
You spit that out!
Huh?
"Come on, get up."
Get up!
What?
Is it the stew-maker?
"Hear the cartel has a guy, dissolves people in acid, puts them in a barrel, makes them soup."
Is that who I'm waiting for?
Is it you?
My job is to place a call at 7:30.
And if you don't make the call?
You get put on a list.
And if you get put on the list... it's unfortunate.
"But if Clive isn't here in the next 15 minutes... soon enough, I'll be talking to a dead man."
Well...
If I'm already dead...
You're a dead man!
You ain't doing too good a job at staying gone.
"You know, sometimes..."
I can't get through an entire day without hearing all kinds of rumors getting told about you.
And a murder.
And a murder.
Thank you.
And the murder of Amanda Holden.
Rumour on the street is you had beef with Mayor Cowell.
"I have no gripe with anyone, Sleet."
The world and time are linear to me.
I see and hear all things the world chooses to show me.
Look at this one.
Hmm.
"Now, young one, you're obviously not at one with this world yet and that is OK, but listen, let me help you."
"Because deep within all of us is a spirit animal, a spiritual guide."
"Now, most people don't allow this animal to take control, but you must."
Mm-hmm.
"Now my animal is a panther, strong, sleek, unafraid."
His...
Mine is a curious goat.
That was it.
That's nice.
"Well, you know, it's all right, I'm slightly ashamed of it."
You must never be ashamed of your spirit animal.
"Yeah, but it's easy for you to say, you're a panther."
Why did you pick a goat?
"You don't choose your spirit animal, it chooses you."
"Yes, of course."
"We're going to find yours, Dermot."
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Shut your eyes.
Now clear that little mind of yours.
"Now, I want you to think of the second animal that comes into your head, not the first one, but the second one."
Pussycat.
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved... not by you, Tim... or your God."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
[Sighs]
I do.
[Beeping]
Wow!
Chocolate bon-bons from L'atelier de Bonheur.
"To be honest, I've never had one of these before."
You can't find Bonheur chocolates in Japan.
My friend who went to Paris for vacation brought these back.
These are for you.
How is it?
It's very smooth.
"It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of bitterness."
"With its rich chocolate aroma and wonderful texture, the overall impression it gives is amazing."
Yeah.
"- It's a tender taste, right?"
It gently unravels your heart.
To be able to eat Bonheur chocolates in Treluyer's shop is such a luxury.
"But this means we've brought in food from outside, right?"
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"But I, love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world."
"Geez, I'm totally jealous of French people who can eat this every day."
Mmmm!
I want to make chocolates like this one day.
- So weird.
"- Yes, yes."
I mean the way people talk.
"I mean, people think we did it."
I know.
It's like we might as well done it anyway at this point.
"I mean, you know, if everybody is talking about it already..."
maybe we...
"I mean, not to make a big deal of it or anything."
Out of what?
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
"It's amazing the things you notice,"
"Llke the corner of his collar that was coming undone,"
"Llke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts,"
"That's all I could see,"
"The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric, I think I have to go."
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
"It's such a lle that you should do what's ln your heart, lf we all did what was ln our hearts, the world would grind to a halt,"
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PS AT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
No exit.
It's like the bullet went in... and vanished.
"Look at this, Al."
Someone dragged her onto that dock.
"Oh, come on."
Lots of women have scuffed-up heels on their shoes.
"No, not Hilla."
Her friend told me that Hilla always kept her clothes perfect.
"Whoever killed her, dragged her to the end of the dock."
"I hate to tell you this, Sherlock, but she could have shot herself."
Where's the gun?
Maybe it fell into the lake.
"No, I don't think so."
Why not?
"If Hilla committed suicide, I wouldn't be here."
The only thing that makes sense is that I'm here to find out who murdered her.
"[ Sam Narrating ] Whenever I quantum leap, I get to see what it's like to walk in another man's shoes."
And sometimes what it's like to drive in his car.
"I knew very little about Hilla, except that she survived a war when everyone else in her family died."
She was either lucky or had a strong will to live.
One of these had run out on her.
I had to find out which one.
Greg.
Ah.
Melvin.
How you doin'?
Fine.
Fine.
"Uh, we're just wrapping up for winter here."
Uh-
"- Um, could you tell me which room was Hilla's?"
The key doesn't have a number on it.
- These were all his decisions?
- Yeah.
We just gave him the stage and he ran with it.
- I hope we got his business number.
- So good.
"Project Jenny, Project Jan is this band here."
- This guy was so good.
"- By the way Jeremy who plays Randy, when we made out in the first club scene and we made out for a while, and he was getting married the next day."
It was like a really funny thing.
It felt like I was his bachelor party.
I didn't find that out until the end of the day.
I felt guilty that I asked him to do that when he's getting married the next morning.
It's a hell of a bachelor party.
- It's all acting.
- Yeah.
- He was in character.
- He's a cool guy.
- Look at his guy.
Look at his guy.
"- This guy, I mean..."
"- Look, he's shameless."
- Somebody get this guy a show.
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
The shot looks like it was orchestrated to highlight the backflip.
- But it wasn't.
It was just in there.
- It was the master of the scene there.
This was the coldest I've ever been in my life.
Ever.
Ever.
Ever.
I mean about your being so wonderful and still single and everything.
Who knows what he meant.
"Well, what's so funny?"
"Lottie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and at your age."
My age.
His age.
Same age.
"Give a little, take a little."
[Blanche laughing]
"Besides, who'd have him even if he asked me?"
That I'd like to see.
"Well, don't kill yourself laughing, Blanche."
"I may be a size 14, but I could get to be a size 10 for him."
"For a man like that, I could even get to be beautiful."
"For a man like that, a woman would do anything."
Just anything.
"Lottie, you didn't...."
Didn't what?
You didn't kill her?
What?
"Have some more cake, Mom."
"No, not for me."
I'm gonna start cutting down.
"You know, Janie, you wouldn't believe it."
"But when your father and me was married, I weighed only 98 pounds."
"He used to call me ""Peanut."""
Used to brag about my figure to everybody.
"In a nice way, of course."
Funny how a woman lets herself go when there's no man around.
"Well, those afternoon teas that you and Mrs. Armstedder indulge in... don't help either, Mom."
"You know, Janie, sometimes I think Blanche Armstedder isn't all there."
Only sometimes?
"Coming, coming!"
"For first time in 30 years, I let myself sleep as much as I want--"
- I know-- - ...and you have to come wake me up.
"I know, Axel, but something is wrong."
"Lisa, you forget Mr. Somers is boss now."
Call him in Long Beach--
"No, no."
"No, Axel."
He's the one who's making it wrong.
This morning I got a notice from him at the lumber yard.
He's canceling the regular monthly order for the shop.
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
"Axel, you didn't buy all these years from Carl just because he's my brother."
You bought because he handles the highest grade of S and F hardwood.
"Sure, sure, but if Mr. Somers wants to buy somewhere else, can I stop him?"
You want me to tell you why he cancelled out?
I'll tell you why.
Because he wants to buy cheap commercial grades of lumber.
Nothing but spruce and hemlock.
"Carl, if Somers did like you say, he will cheapen trademark."
He would make it nothing.
Why would he want to kill goose that lays the golden eggs?
That's crazy.
But Carl loses his biggest account.
What can we do?
[phone rings]
I will talk to you later.
And do not worry so much.
- There will be bigger things for all of us.
- [ring] [ring]
Hello.
"They say to him, ""What's the matter?"
"Don't you say anything?"""
"He says, ""What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"""
"So she says, ""Shut up!"
"You're always talking! """
"But in Italian, it sounds much nicer."
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy ever tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
I like this one...one dog goes one way and the other dog goes the other way.
"One's going east, and the other one's going west."
So what?
"And this guy's saying, ""What do you want from me?"" The guy's got a nice head of white hair."
Beautiful.
The dog looks the same.
Looks like somebody we know.
Without the beard?
"No, it's him."
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
"For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted."
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line.
"You got out of line, you got whacked."
Everybody knew the rules.
"But sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked."
Hits became a habit.
"Guys would get into arguements over nothing and before you knew it, one of them was dead."
They were shooting each other all the time.
They're based on the Dominicans who fought for La Independencia.
- Los Gavilleros?
- Yeah.
They fought the US with a guerilla waftare for four years.
"For me, it's just another way of talking about sugar."
"That's what the Gavilleros were fighting over-- foreign companies buying property from people who don't even own it, then kicking the campesinos off their land."
"Anyway, that's how I got the concept for ""Europa."""
Carlos...
I've got to be honest with you.
I really like what you did.
- Really?
- I love it!
"And it couldn't come in a more peftect time, because I just lost a series."
"The artist was brilliant, but he was terribly depressed and he could never work."
And I had to find something to fill the book in our slate.
- Okay!
- Great!
How soon can you finish?
- You never gonna believe it.
- What?
- You've got to guess.
- I don't know.
You won the lotto?
- I asked Daisy to marry me.
- Get the fuck outta here!
I asked her to marry me and she said yes.
I am high as a motheftucker right now.
"Dude, do you know what you're doing?"
Of course I know.
"I know I say shit sometimes, but that's just me being stupid."
"I'm getting fucking married, bro'."
"Yo-- all right then, well, shit!"
She got pregnant in '96'.
Who was she?
Where did she work?
She must have talked to someone.
I brought the plants in.
"If the room is too hot, they'll think it's spring."
- I'll call if we find anything.
"- Yes, OK."
"Let's hope for a period without frost, or we can't plant them until spring."
I've made some pumpkin soup.
You didn't see it.
Close it again.
The ultrasound images.
I'll heat the soup.
"No, I'm not up for soup, candles, and ultrasound images right now."
There's no need for you to get upset.
I'm only staying till tomorrow.
Did you speak to Mark?
Yes.
All he said was that he didn't know what to do.
I need to think about myself now...
and the baby.
"I'll move in with a friend, or move back to my parents."
That's likely to change when the baby comes.
- You have the ﬂat.
"- No, that won't be ready."
Someone stopped by to inspect the ceilings.
"They say there's asbestos, and that it'll all have to be torn down."
"Well, if you could handle being a single mum, I suppose I can as well."
I don't think I handled it particularly well.
I thought I could give Mark a...
"Well, I couldn't."
It's in every paper.
"Your name, your picture, everything."
"Gee, makes a person afraid to go out on a job."
"You know, I was supposed to sit for the Thompsons tonight."
But now....
I bet you never wanna baby-sit again.
"Well, you'd always be imagining a killer was sneaking around or something."
"Come on, Lottie, I bet you're just dying to tell me all about it."
"Move over, will you?"
"Well, if that's your attitude."
[slurping]
It's cherry chocolate with tutti-frutti.
[groaning]
There.
"Come on now, tell me."
What was she really like?
"It's a long, long story, Blanche."
"Well, don't worry."
I've got refills.
"Well, go on."
"You know, how I've often said... that sometimes a pretty face will do you more harm than good."
"Well, that Clara Nash was doomed to a violent end."
"Way she was carrying on, she deserved what she got."
"Shame on you, Lottie."
Go on.
You know how particular I am about who I sit for.
"Well, I never would've sat for her."
Except I had a soft spot in my heart for the boy.
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
What a gentleman he was.
"And the way she treated him, he deserved something better."
Did you see the flowers the women's club sent?
"And you said it yourself,"
"""If you can be one thing, be efficient."""
"Do's it once, do's it rights."
Figures it out.
"Pitter-patter, let's get at 'er, figure it out."
You shouldn't gang up on people on their birthdays.
We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family.
She's comin' this afternoon.
Don't be in your barnin' clothes.
(SPOON SCRAPING)
"I fuckin' hate praccy, bro."
"It's Senior-A whale shit, bro."
Why even praccy?
"Like, I'm just gonna praccy like a donkey."
I could donk all day.
Just blast clappers at the hash marks at the fuckin' plug tendy of ours.
"Clappys from the hashys, buddy."
Just stepping' into one from the ladies' tees.
Just bulldoze that speed bump.
Just firing' ringers at his ears.
Just firing' warm-up ringers.
Just tossing' chest-high sauce at the boys.
Just tossing' ankle-high rocket sauce.
Just tossing' mad sui's up the middle.
Just tossing' mad sui's through the trolley tracks.
Just tossing' mad breakout sui's directly into the skates.
Just tossing' mad breakout sui's.
"You know, it might be a fun praccy after all."
"I could donk all day, boys."
(MUTTERING)
I don't think I've ever sat on a hay bale before.
"That's a straw bale, and that's barley."
"And our little girl Tricia, the six-year-old, named it Checkers."
- 58 million people saw it.
"- And like all kids, they love the dog."
"- Itwas shameless, :"
"Itwas manipulative, :"
"- Ljustwanna say right now, regardless ofwhatthey say about him, we're gonna keep him."
Itwas a huge success.
- [Crowd Cheering]
"- He stayed on the national scene, serving two terms as vice president under Eisenhower."
"Against Khrushchev at the Kitchen Debate in Moscow... and stoned by Latin mobs in Venezuela,"
Nixon once again became a national hero.
But it all came to a crashing end against Kennedy in 1960... and Pat Brown in California in '62.
And thus ends a great American political story.
"The truth is, we never knewwho Richard Nixon really was, and nowthat he is gone we neverwill."
"[March Slowing, Ends]"
[CocktailJazz]
[People Talking]
- [Woman] Poor little Tricia.
- Herdaddy couldn't get a job... in this city when he gotoutof Duke.
Everywhite-shoe lawyerfirm turned me down.
Didn't have the right look.
- I couldn'teven get into the F.B.I. - [Man] Hi.
I How are ya?
"Did you catch that picture ofyou in the news lastweek, Dick?"
- You were standin' on Fifth Avenue.
"- Oh, yeah."
"You were lookin' straightahead... and everyone else was lookin'the other way, like you justfarted or somethin'."
"[Laughing] Itsaid-Itsaid,"
"""Who remembers Dick Nixon?"""
Unbelievable.
I was screamin'.
"Yeah, thatwas hilarious, Martha."
"You know, that's not gonna get your son back."
Quinn?
Is that his name?
It's not gonna get him back.
"And if you keep that up, you're gonna have two problems instead of one."
You know what he told me?
"He told me, ""I want my mama back."""
I want...
I want my son back.
"Well, um, Child Services won't let you live with Quinn again until you get treatment."
"And to get treatment, I need to prove PTSD."
- Post-traumatic stress...
- This is not combat-related.
"Hell, I got both my arms."
I didn't get my legs blown off.
I'm not in no damn wheelchair.
I know.
PTSD from military sexual trauma is just as real.
"Yeah, I know."
And it makes the military look bad.
What makes the military look bad is your senior officer raping you over and over again.
I don't want people looking at me like I'm crazy.
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.
I think I have some insight into that.
So you think you've seen what I've seen?
"No, but I've seen some pretty bad stuff."
I have seen thousands of spiders running up my best friend's face.
You wacked.
Yeah.
It's called schizophrenia.
So they sent me somebody crazier than I am.
"I made commitments,"
"I told her you would behave like an adult, and you do exactly the opposite."
"Wait, you're starting to piss me off."
- I'm telling you it's not my fault.
"- Right, you're a victim."
"If you want to be helped, you need to change your tune!"
What is this fucking lecture?
"You pretend to be nice, but you're an arsehole like the rest of them!"
Take back what you just said.
It's not my fault trouble follows me around!
My life sucks and it won't change.
Only my mother understood me.
Even when she was wasted she understood me.
"You know, Dylan is one of these helpless teenagers."
"He's nice, and the next minute he messes up."
"It's true, I misjudged him."
I heard he came to talk to me.
The other two went after him when he meant no harm.
See if the judge can move him to another home.
No one can stand him here.
That's the paradox for these kids.
They need attention and all they get is hate.
I'll call the judge.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Mr Zeppini.
"I was freed an hour ago, so I came to thank you."
May I?
- Please.
A client who thanks me is a rare thing.
That how I am.
When I'm happy I let people know.
You will see her in time.
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine."
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
"Isn't that right, Mr. Rafet?"
Sure.
The one who gives less...
We'll talk about that later.
I will prepare your house for you with pictures that just left.
"Excuse me, I'll be back soon."
"Bro, I have some good news for you and some bad news."
The bad news is that Rafet's here.
Good news is that Professor Candan's on his lap
What lap?
Don't exaggerate guys.
"Of course, we might say that it's bad news for you."
What's she doing on his lap?
Mr. Rafet was giving her something but we came in at that moment.
I thought I'd ask you about what to do with these lovebirds.
There's nothing going on.
Decision made.
She's dead for me now.
She's got no taste at all.
He's very depressed.
He's very angry...
And his grandfather is from the tribe...
What happened?
What do you want?
Tell me.
All you have to do is give me the answer keys of all the remaining test exams.
"That's one... if this matter leaves this room, I'll make sure the record you... die for goes public."
And that's two.
Have some water.
"Come on, son."
"If anything goes wrong, I know you and you know me."
- Don't get anyone else involved.
Hmm?
Do you hate your job or what?
No.
The only job I ever hated was that horrible job as a bag boy at the supermarket.
I'm certainly glad I had the sense to get out of that after about a day.
"You've been listening, haven't you?"
Voices carry.
"Seriously, George, I mean, you've been a teacher all your life."
Do you still enjoy getting up in the morning?
"Oh, Alan..."
"It would be very easy for me to tell you that I have dedicated the last 38 years to several thousand young minds, and that is my chief joy and reason for getting up in the morning."
Except it isn't.
I teach because I like it.
And because it's fun for me.
"Ah, but when it stops being fun?"
"Well, then I suppose I would look to my family and friends for support to help me find something new."
"Well, thank you, George."
You've taught me something.
And it was fun for me.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
"I mean, who would possibly stop and pick me up in the middle of rural Pennsylvania?"
Whoa!
"Young friend, how far art thou traveling?"
Me?
"Yes, thee."
"Uh, well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I'm going as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
That farmhouse there?
Yes.
That farmhouse there.
I see.
"For Foon's sake, don't offend him, OK?"
But that's the fact!
Sorry!
...
Summon the witness.
I was washing rice inside the kitchen.
"When I heard the gun shot, I rushed to the backyard at once."
What did you see?
"I saw Ho Chun lying on the ground, with blood all over his body."
Foon pointed a gun at him and laughed.
"He said, ""Ho Chun, you are dead meat now."""
What's next?
I was afraid and screamed!
Ho Foon got mad and chased after us.
Objection!
What did you say?
What you've just said differs from the statement you gave to the police.
I just want to ask why you amended your statement?
"Objection substained, witness should answer the question."
I worry that Ho Foon will avenge me.
So I didn't tell all the truth.
"I have no question, it's your turn."
"I would like to show the jury the evidence, item number one first."
"Witness, this gun can shoot only one bullet."
"You said you heard the gun shot, so how could he shoot you again?"
He didn't want to kill me with gun.
But by what?
Sword.
Are you kidding me?
Really?
"He chased after me and wanted to kill me with ""capital chopper""."
"He chased after me, and I was so afraid..."
"- Das, you know me well right?"
"- Yes, I do."
But they say the house is too big.
Can I make it smaller?
"If it is too big, check whether they could share it.Let them share the rent."
- OK
- What happened?
"- The big mouth won't reduce the rent, it seems."
"Since the girl too feels the house is too big, you both could share the rent."
Is she OK with it?
Paramasivam is checking that.
"If it is OK with her, would you agree?"
"- I agree, but she musn't not be lawyer."
"- She won't be lawyer, don't worry man."
"If he agrees, I don't mind."
"- Hey, Paramasivam, my client has agreed."
- Madam has agreed too.
- Then give 1 lakh as advance.
Why does he give expression as if it is a register marriage?
Would he ask for a garland too?
- I'll take that room.
"- OK, I'll take the other one."
"- Hey Paramasivam, are you riding the pillion?"
- yes.
- The hot seat might blister your piles.
"- As if he is my doctor, go to hell."
-You would be watching her all the time from tomorrow onwards.
Start the bike
"- Her dress is lovely, isn't it?"
- Shall I borrow it for you to wear?
"- If both of us are in the same profession, it would be a hassle."
Let's avoid that.
' This is what you did.
That's because...
I was shocked.
I didn't even really get to see anything.
Oh my God!
So... you and this guy...
haven't seen each other yet?
How can you be like that when you guys are getting married in a month?
Is that...
something a kid should be saying right now?
Just go and pack up some more stuff.
Teacher Gil...
You want me to show you?
My body is really rocking right now.
Look.
This...
Isn't a body you can get in a month or two.
-Look.
This guy's abs are like chocolate!
-Don't do it!
It's nice.
I wonder why this guy hasn't shown you his body that he's worked on?
"I thought since he took such good care of it, I thought it was to look good for you..."
Yoon Jae...
Likes to work out because he likes to keep himself busy.
That's right.
"I'm sure at the very least, he was diligent about working out every day for at least 2 hours."
"To be in that shape, do you really have to work out every day for at least 2 hours?"
Unconditionally.
He should've seen you more during those hours.
He must have given you excuses to take those hours to work out.
I guess to this guy...
For instance?
"You'll need a second in command for that special stunt, Sir."
"Young man, ""stunt"" is a word I do not like."
Not when applied to a military operation.
"Slip of the tongue, Sir."
The Chief Instructor said he put a word in.
He did.
"It's a word I wouldn't care to use, but we'll see."
"A falling object descends earthwards at the rate of 32 feet a second, accelerating to the maximum speed of 176 feet a second."
That's what I call descending.
"You'll be all right, Alf."
As long as you land on that big head of yours.
"Green light on, action stations, Number One, and er..."
Hold it!
"What, may I ask, are you doing up there?"
Practising.
"If you want to be polite to a regimental sergeant major, you address him as ""Sir""."
"Practising, Sir."
Get down from there before I take you to the guard room!
Two volunteers to put him on his bed.
You and you.
At the double!
"Ooh, my leg."
So you're what they're turning out as soldiers these days.
I wanted to see for myself.
Mm.
Mm-hm!
A horrible lot of little men.
Thank God we've still got a navy.
Let's take a look.
... I'll kick him in the...
"First balloon jump 0600 hours, tomorrow."
But I've always been a little sensitive about it.
You understand?
"Oh, I certainly do, sir."
"Lou, Lou, I'm talking, but you're not listening."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) There's no money in the budget.
"Lou, will you believe me?"
There's no money.
"Look, that's the way it is, take it or leave it."
Good.
Good.
You got yourself a deal.
"What is it this time, Lieutenant?"
I'm a very busy man.
"There was no one out there, sir."
It's all right.
So I just came in.
Congratulations.
Congratulations for what?
I heard you came into a lot of money.
I see.
You heard about my little windfall?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Lieutenant, if you think I knew anything about this, you're wrong."
My lawyer called me and told me my wife's safe deposit box was practically layered with receipts for these silver certificates.
I'll be damned if I can figure out how she did it.
"I think the government's gonna have a little trouble, too, because she never declared them as income."
She kept the certificates in a numbered account in a Canadian bank.
"And it all goes to you, right, sir?"
And it all goes to me.
After taxes.
Including a few lovely IOUs from Ward Fowler.
"Is that so, sir?"
- It's good to get out.
It was hot.
- I didn't notice it but I suppose I would if I'd been drinking as many beers as you have.
Thanks for reminding me.
Let's get some.
- Why don't you have an ice cream soda?
"- Oh, no."
Do you have to wake up with a hangover?
- Come on.
Let's go into Nick's.
- All right.
"Well, kids, how do you like the moving picture tonight?"
- It was grand.
"- Kind of sappy, if you ask me."
Sure.
Too much love stuff.
Is not for me.
"I like the racketeer pictures, boy."
"You know, shoot them up."
Is more excitement as love.
"Why, Nick, where's the romance in your soul?"
"Where is the what, please?"
Romance.
"You know, two people falling in love and sitting in the moonlight gazing into each other's eyes."
"Well, I like this too but I like better to do it myself, personal than to see some guy in the movies do it."
"Huh, kid?"
I don't care what they say.
I think that love story was beautiful tonight.
It's a lot of bunk.
No real man would ever propose like that.
"- Oh, they don't."
- You don't have to look at a girl and tell her eyes are like the twinkling stars.
- Was I with anybody?
"- Uh, no."
Did I talk to anybody?
Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?
No.
"You, uh, just ate, and then you left."
"Uh, gave me your watch first."
Do you still have the watch?
Best wingman I ever had.
That does not look familiar.
And it's a knock-off.
But it's the freshest clue we have.
I'll buy it back from you.
Sure.
My brother was right.
Right about what?
The Phantom.
A serial killer Phillip was hunting.
He stumbled onto it working a missing-persons case.
We haven't heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.
That's why Phillip called him The Phantom...
Because no one has any idea that he exists.
"According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years."
A bicoastal serial killer?
"Right before Phillip flew back to L.A., he told me that he'd had a break in the case, that he was close to identifying The Phantom."
He must have gotten too close to the truth.
I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom's alleged victims.
Total of seven...
"Four in L.A., three in New York."
All seven were killed with a knife.
Any pattern besides the knife?
No.
"Well, your brother's quite a character."
"And your father, he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
So I have to be a mechanic too.
"Do you wanna go into the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
"More than anything, no."
"You know I don't wanna, uh, overstep my bounds here but you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
The point is there are maybe three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life.
"And you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else."
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to the teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
"Go have your Robin Williams, ""Oh, captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[EXHALES]
[SIGHS]
GIRL:
Remember Dan Aykroyd in Ghost Busters with that cigarette?
- He does that scene.
- It's hanging vertically.
"I know exactly what you're talking about, when he finds Slimer."
- How'd he get that cigarette to hang?
- It's incredible.
I'm glad that my life's insecurities of thinking people are mad at me got put to good use in this movie.
"- Yeah, it was such a good choice."
"- Oh, Ari."
I've been thinking that a lot lately.
"The phone rings and, ""Hey, we need to talk about something."""
"I always have the impulse now of saying, ""Are you mad at me?"""
"If I had a dime for every time I say that in life, I'd be a rich woman."
You haven't said that to me.
"You've only been like, ""Do you love me?"""
"""Do you still love me?"""
The answer is always yes.
"That's a pretty good one too, right there."
"Oh, my gosh."
- That's hideous.
- We were laughing filming this.
Right?
For some reason?
- We were giggling.
- Why were we laughing?
"Oh, it was when we were doing that shouting thing, which I can't say..."
I can't say because it's a bad word.
Remember the high-pitched shout?
"Oh, yeah."
"Wait, I thought that was in the van."
I think this is where it became invented.
Unfortunately.
"Yep, today is your lucky day."
Awesome !
"I mean, wait, what do you mean ?"
"Well, first, we have to get rid of that dorky bow tie."
"Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man."
Surely we can do something with this hair.
"I think I have some nail scissors in my purse, hmm ?"
I can't get anyone on the phone.
"Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll walk you through it."
Just open up the back door.
"It's easy, don't worry about it."
"Ryan, you're asking me to use tools and exert myself physically."
I think we both know where this is going.
"Yeah, okay, well, uh, start by putting the jack under the frame by the, uh, by the door there."
Yeah.
"The jack is this thing with the handle, right ?"
Yeah.
"Actually, wait."
"First, um... loosen the bolts with that wrench."
All right.
There we go.
Okay.
"All right, you may find this hard to believe, Ryan, but when I was younger, I used to be a bit of a worrier."
You don't say.
"To distract myself from worrying,"
I would sometimes make lists.
Didn't matter what the lists were.
They could be anything...
every cereal
"I've ever eaten, or... uh, the names of every planet mentioned in Star Wars."
Whatever.Anyways...
"You want to make a list, Seth ?"
And here are the complete assets as of...
"Harold, I can't even balance a checkbook."
You'll have to explain it to me.
It's very simple.
"If we don't make some money in the next few months, we're out of business."
How much do you need?
"We need $50,000, partner."
"Oh, we've gone back to a partnership, have we?"
We never dissolved.
Everything's split right down the middle.
Up to now it's been 50%% of nothing.
When do the profits start coming in?
"""We could make a lot of money, Mrs. Brown. "" Remember?"
I remember you thought it was a pretty good idea at the time.
I was wrong.
I guess you should've stayed with John.
"Darling, I didn't mean that."
It wasn't just the money.
"You know that, don't you?"
I know.
Isn't there anything we can do?
"We've got to find some way to raise $50,000."
"Oh, the stuff will sell."
It just takes time.
Have you tried to get a loan?
All over town.
"They'd lend it to John, but they think I'm just a young upstart."
Maybe if John used his influence.
Would that help?
I don't think he'd do it.
"He'd do anything for the company, you know that."
It's worth trying.
I've been dieting for a whole half a day and I haven't even lost a pound.
"Sabrina, I found that the key to losing weight is eating the right foods."
Who are you channeling?
The other day I saw you put sugar on bacon.
Lean bacon.
There's got to be something in here that will help me fit in my dress.
"Hey, look at this ad."
"""Thanks to Blubber-Be-Gone,"
"I lost 50 pounds in three days."""
That's ridiculous.
"What'd he do, lop off a leg?"
Here goes.
"""Thin my thighs, lose my roll, make me skinnier than Manute Bol."""
Ooh!
I see you called me in the nick of time.
I did?
Losing weight the Blubber- Be-Gone way is easy.
"Whenever you're hungry, instead of eating food, just mix yourself a shake."
Taste?
Not bad;
although I still prefer ipecac.
SALEM:
"Excuse me, but I think we've met before."
Weren't you selling that turn-your-eye-gunk- into-gold kit a few years ago?
"No, that must have been my brother."
Happy dieting.
This is great.
"I'm going to lose weight,"
"I'm going to look fantastic in my new special dress, and I'll be elected queen of the ball."
Right.
"And one of these days, my pink eye is going to pay off big."
"Oh, no."
Earth...
Fire...
Air...
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the northern portal and trapped Jinora in the spirit world.
"Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers."
"Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer."
"And in the Southern water tribe,"
Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war.
But Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.
Dad's back!
Where's Jinora?
No!
"Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world, but she's going to be all right."
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.
I should have never let Jinora enter the spirit world without me.
I couldn't protect her.
"I'm so sorry, Pema."
"I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
"Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."
You've got a visitor.
"- Hey, Mako."
- Hey.
What's with the fancy duds?
I'm on my way to the big finale
Hero of the South.
"Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you..."
Because you're in jail and stuff.
Thanks for the reminder.
"Hey, I brought you something."
Knocking.
Where's Olive?
Olive Snook was where Lily had taken her.
It was a place that valued Olive's silence as much as Lily did.
"Hello, Betty."
A little bee tells me you've met Kitty Pimms.
Briefly.
"Well, this morning Kitty says to me, she says, ""I wanna speak to Betty Bee."
"Bee-Girl to Bee-Girl, tell her how much she means."""
Bless.
"If there's a lull in the conversation, you just ask Kitty why she loves bees."
Oh?
Oh.
- You'll be glad you did.
- Thank you.
"Betty, I know Kentucky was your number one Bee-Girl and I wanna live up to her standard of honey harvesting and sales excellence."
"You're not really going to stand there and kiss my ass, are you?"
Or didn't Woolsey tell you?
He didn't.
How politic.
- Tell me what?
- His acquisition was a hostile takeover.
"- No, he didn't mention the hostile part."
"- Oh, yes."
The ass you were just kissing is now just the ass of a retired honey mascot.
That's my new title:
Honey mascot/consultant.
Used to be founder and president.
That would make me stinging mad.
"I get to keep my old office, just not my dignity."
"When all of your bees die, it's hard to care about any of it."
- All your bees died?
In the blink of an eye...
"Mrs. Collins, you have a call on our house phone."
It sounded urgent.
..the wife of a US Senator vanished...
She have any enemies?
She teaches second grade.
You have any enemies?
But before they can find out where she is...
- She's gone missing before.
- Twelve years ago.
"Not only did Sara disappear, but the story did, too."
..they left to find out who she is.
Her name's Nicki Johnson.
12 years ago I asked her to marry me.
I never saw her again.
"Now, the mystery is just beginning to unravel"
It's Jessica.
- Your ex-wife ?
- I don't understand.
They've never met before.
"Jessica Nevins, the Senator's ex-wife is considered a person of interest and investigators are attempting to locate her."
"Daddy, what is it?"
What aren't you telling me?
It's Amanda McNeal.
The wife of Curtis McNeal.
He was the mayor of Atlanta.
"Killed back then, kept on ice until now?"
It's a prayer card.
"24 hours ago, Sara Collins, wife of Senator Jeffrey Collins, vanished."
"We're here at the home of Senator Jeffrey Collins, who is about to issue his first public statement since his wife's disappearance."
I'm concerned about Judy Nash and her allegations of marital difficulties.
She's fishing.
I know the difference.
I hope you told the cops that.
Did you have any alcohol at all?
"Like two glasses of champagne, three tops."
And the boys were in the car?
Does it help that I was taking them to Disneyland?
It does not.
"So, what do we do about Diane?"
I have no idea.
You have no idea?
You're my lawyer.
"Yeah, well, I'm thinking of leaving the law..."
Starting a zoo.
Because I seem to have discovered the only animal in the known world that can actually fuck itself.
Wow.
"Please don't take this the wrong way, Matt, but you are the worst client I ever had, seriously."
I'd happily trade you for two Mel Gibsons and a Tiger Woods.
Jesus!
"As far as the D.U.I., this is your first offense, amazingly, so we can probably get you off with a little community service."
"As far as Diane, you're on your own."
Jesus!
Yep.
The new guy's changing everything.
Time to get out the old résumés.
"Well, I think that's premature."
I don't have a résumé.
How do you not have a résumé?
This is the only place I've ever worked.
"Well, except for the summer after college."
I was one of the snow whites at Disneyland.
I never knew that.
I worked the Graveyard Shift.
"We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?"
"Come, come, Kali."
My towel.
"Say, Jack."
- Buck's gone again.
"- Yes, I know."
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
"Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company."
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
"According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago."
"I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake."
"- Yes, I-I know, but-"
- If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin!
That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
"Why, Jack, I never suspected."
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
"Oh, I want to write poetry."
I want to compose.
"I want to sing, paint."
You go from here.
I wont find the same situation again.
"You dad with me in this room, on bed... final the car's deal."
Car's deal when?
Now here on this bed... should i tell Sonu?
No...
why?
Youth dad wanted to hide from you.
Actually he bought the vintage car to sale his stuff... in 1000000/-.
1000000/-?
"What is all this Dad, we already have car, cancel."
"Cancel the deal, the deal is cancel."
"Laxmi Jee you told deal done, bed!"
But dad?
Deal is done.
But my advance of 100000/-
i and sitting in front of underworld don.
You know... why i have started undergarment business.
Because it has under like underworld.
I got this 100000/-
"Laxmi Narayan Jee, thank you, the car is yours, i should leave now, i have to make agreements papers."
Come at 4 o'clock and get 900000/- too yeah sure.
You saved me.
And you caught me.
I always wanted to marry some... some underworld don.
"How excited, how thrill there life is."
Husband go in the morning.
And wife didn't know if the husband will come back home or not.
In the night when husband come back and kiss.
It is feel like that's a last kiss.
Because don't know from where bullet can come.
And husband could have encounter.
This could be really good for our marriage.
"I mean, if there are things bothering us about each other, we should just get them out there, you know?"
It's healthy.
I guess.
"All right, so come on."
"Hit me, baby."
Uh...
I guess maybe sometimes...
You wear a little too much makeup.
What do you mean?
"Well, just, you know, all that goop over there."
Sometimes I think you could just...
Back her down a notch.
"Ok, this is stinging more than I thought it would."
So you really think I wear too much makeup?
No.
"I just-- like if we're going out for burgers, you know, and I throw on a pair of sweatpants and a baseball hat, you look like you're going to the opera..."
Or you're in the opera.
Ok.
Ok.
I will try to wear less makeup.
"Well, this is great."
All right.
"But we're gonna do this together, ok?"
And I'm gonna join a gym and start to diet.
I'm gonna whip this body into shape 'cause nobody's calling me fatty mcbutterpants anymore.
Somebody called you fatty mcbutterpants?
"On line at the bank yesterday, yeah."
And it took seeing the big and tall bag to push you over the edge?
Mmm-hmm.
Ok.
I dieted for the last 8 hours.
Yes.
"It's a lot to ask of you, Alice, I know."
"But that's what families are for, right?"
"Yeah, he's just walked in, Jeff, as a matter of fact."
Yes.
"So, absolutely, I'll pass it on."
"Okay, if you can just watch your shooting ratio, love."
"Yeah, we'll see you then."
Cheers.
-How are things on location?
-Very hot apparently.
He said it's like a furnace in that room.
'Cause they're right under the flight path they've got to keep all the windows closed and there's bugger all ventilation.
But they're all thrilled with the material.
He said the whole thing's got a real buzz to it.
It's gonna be really different to the rest of the series.
And John's put together a bit of cut material for you to have a look at.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
-What?
"-No, I've just... been getting a lot of static electricity today."
"Just after I'd polished the table, it was a combination, maybe, the friction and the weather."
"Anyway, what happened to you?"
You get whiplash or something?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What?
What?
Tell me.
I went to an orgy.
"Yeah, right."
-What did I say?
I said you wouldn't believe me.
-An orgy?
"Well, I know you know."
"Now, I may have run across Mrs. Sellers at the grocery today."
And she just may have mentioned that
John was gonna give me his pin tonight?
Possibly.
"I have lots of pins from lots of boys, Mama."
"I know, Zelda dear."
"I've been followin' along lo these many years, but somehow this one's different, isn't it, baby?"
"How do you know when it's different, Mama?"
I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
What kind of answer did you want?
"Well, he cares about you a great deal."
Anyone can see that and...
"You know, he'll certainly be able to care for you."
Those are not unimportant things.
I know that.
"You and Daddy never think I do, but I do."
It's what worried everyone so about Scott.
"But, Mama... you weren't happy marrying' Daddy."
"Oh, come now, Zelda."
I know there were other possibilities.
Were you in love with any of them?
You can find something to love about every man if you put your mind to it.
I don't want to have to put my mind to it.
"But you will, baby."
Whether you want to or not.
I'm just gonna run this laundry downstairs.
"I can do that, Mama."
"Oh, of course."
"Thank you, dear."
[ticking]
"No, no."
No it doesn't.
No.
How can you read it?
It's just moving all over the place.
Let me see that Lilly.
I'm sorry.
But I mean how much more bad news can you take?
I mean you just found out you don't get to go to college.
With your best friend the day after you get rejected.
By the best boyfriend you ever had.
And now you've got an eye twitch.
But my grades are awesome.
I killed it on the SAT.
This is so not fair!
I know.
I mean I guess that stuff just wasn't important to Jesse.
And Stanford accepted you?
Lilly stand extremely still and don't let her sense your fear.
There has got to be some kind of mistake!
Lilly and I have just about the same grades.
And she only did a little bit better on the SAT.
And that's because my energy drink made me have to tinkle twice.
And Lilly can hold it like a camel!
I must say the fact that you just drove 200 miles.
To plead your case is very impressive.
That's the kind of character we look for here at Stanford.
We're going to be very sad not having you here.
Cookie?
This isn't fair.
I am being discriminated against.
Because I have a small bladder.
That's a lot of money.
But not for Danny boy.
Somebody else can marry that teddy bear.
"I'll just take the $50,000 and-- [whistles]-- blow away."
Just thought I'd mention it to see what you had in your mind.
Yeah?
"You, uh..."
"You wouldn't be thinking of running out on me, would you, lover?"
Do I have a choice?
No.
Not unless you want the police in Chicago to know where you are.
"All right, you made me set it up for you."
"Look, Aunt Olivia's going to be wearing the diamonds, not Merle, so with that little piece of information, will you please just get out of here and leave me alone?"
"- And leave Merle alone, too."
- Okay.
Okay.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Danny.
How are you going to do it?
The same old way?
"You know, you're too much."
Get out of here and leave me alone!
"Leave Merle alone, too!"
"Danny, how are you going to do it, the same old way?"
"What do you think I am, a sucker?"
But I might tell a partner.
"Oh, forget I asked."
You're blowing a great opportunity.
"With all the contacts you can make with that camera and my talent,"
- we could retire in a year.
- I'm going to retire right after this one.
Then make it a good one.
"I was really eating this, because I use..."
I remember I said that I thought when girls ate in movies it looked fake and like they weren't swallowing.
Like they were just gonna throw...
"Like, barf it into a thing after."
Because usually they give you a bucket to spit stuff out.
I hate when I see it in movies where they're not eating and not swallowing.
- It does get disgusting.
"- Yeah, it was gross."
And I regretted it.
I skipped lunch that day and went and...
I did a scene once where I ate a fig per take.
"And we did it like all day and I was like, ""Why did I do this?"""
Because you can't get out of it once you've started.
And drinking stuff too.
It's hard too.
"Like, if you have a lot of beverage."
Don't get me started about drinking things.
God.
This is a real phone.
"- Oh, boy."
- And in the background...
"There were people in the background, like Rachel Cohn, who wrote the book."
And David Levithan.
"Yeah, where are you?"
Did you leave the city?
- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?
Second and Ninth.
"Okay, well, don't leave."
"I'm gonna come over, okay?"
"In the meantime, could you pass that message on?"
I'm happy about something.
Come on.
What do you got?
A lot.
"AUTEC is, like, crazy amazing."
"You've got your Bermuda Triangle, your wormholes, you've got your magnetic field deviations."
Just wish there was a way to contain it all.
You're a mapper.
Oh.
I'm warning you.
You should get out of my head while you still can.
Can you map the bullet back to the shooter?
"Slug that killed Ridgeway, it's 30-caliber, definitely unusual."
The one thing I do know is that it's not military specs.
I'm still trying to track it back to the exact weapon it was fired from.
"Track faster, Abbs."
You know why you're so gruff all the time?
You need more sex.
I'm not answering that.
You just did.
"I am telling you, I saw a bounce in his step."
And Elliott...
"Elliott was sure about Ryan's pupils, as well."
How am I gonna survive Gibbs dating a woman who thinks I'm a game show host?
What does that even mean?
Does she think I'm cheesy?
That I like pencil-thin microphones?
"See, I don't buy it."
Gibbs is a lone wolf.
You have to be observant.
"Next time they come in here, you need to open your eyes and really look."
GIBBS:
"Okay, what are we looking at?"
Grace was fussy all night and sometimes a car ride settles her down.
I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
What am I gonna tell my husband?
"""Need a new car""?"
You're going to feel a little pinprick and then some burning before it kicks in.
You have a bunch of phone messages.
Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
"Oh, crap."
Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
Could you go down to that toy store on Michigan Avenue for me?
You want me to go outside?
Yeah.
It's just a few blocks.
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.
- In the storm?
"- What, you afraid you'll melt?"
What about the lightning?
I'm a pretty big target.
"Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern."
The results are back for that little girl who ejected from the car.
- Is she awake yet?
"- Not yet, but I'm gonna double-check."
Baby's head CT is negative.
- Just some soft tissue swelling.
- Is she awake?
"No, she's still sedated."
Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
This is Bradley Anderson.
His wife and daughter were brought in.
Cast off the bow lines.
"We're good to go, first thing."
"Bring her back in one piece, Joe, you're goin' without me."
Did you hear back from the city planner?
Yeah.
She confirmed that viaducts were built over the old rail lines.
What used to be on street level is now a subterranean ghost town.
"Well, Valera and his cohorts must have used that to hide Sara 'cause after we lifted our roadblocks, it would've been easy to move her."
"Yeah, well, we might've identified one of those cohorts."
"This Bluetooth you found, turns out the units are embedded with 48 bit identifiers."
This one's synced to a cell phone.
You got a number?
Better.
I got a name.
Marcy's boyfriend.
Ben Wilson.
- Ben.
- Hey.
I need to know what's going on.
What are you talking about?
Why was there blood on your sweatshirt?
"You took it, didn't you?"
"I need the truth, Ben."
"Believe me, it's better if you don't know."
Don't try to protect me.
I can't stand that.
Okay.
Someone paid me to deliver that money.
Who?
I didn't think it was a big deal.
The delivery went bad.
"A guy got hurt, but it was nothing to do with Sara and it was nothing to do with me."
That's a bad idea.
They're getting away!
That was close.
Bravo.
"Well done, MacGyver."
I knew you'd get us out of that mess.
I always said you're my brightest student.
I'm sorry.
You've every right to be angry with me.
I was wrong.
I was foolish to think that I could control Cleeve.
You almost got us killed!
You must believe me.
I never meant any harm to come to you or Kelly.
"The truth is, I was frightened."
I'd lost my position at the academy.
I was desperate.
"I mean, this is my last chance."
I couldn't bear the thought of losing it.
I thought you hated treasure hunters like Cleeve.
I do.
But finding the Treasure of Atlantis means more than wealth.
"It would prove that Atlantis really did exist and there were times when people didn't live by war and conquest, but worshiped peace and knowledge."
"And if we were like that once, maybe we can be like that again."
It's a nice dream.
I'm convinced that it can become a reality.
"It's a wonderful dream, professor."
But did it ever occur to you that Cleeve might have other plans for the treasure?
Do you think he and Zavros will come after us?
Yes.
"Yes, I do."
The Tower of Fear.
- Madam.
- What is it?
What are you doing here?
Please take me in.
I do not wish to invite trouble by taking in Master Yi's man.
Leave.
But you promised you'd take me in.
The situation has changed.
I must break that promise.
I mean to sever my ties with Master Yi.
You don't have to...
that tie is already severed.
The master is dead.
What do you mean he's dead?
Jang Bogo attacked and took the master's life.
Is Yum Moon also dead?
He wasn't at the base at the time of attack.
Please...
...take me in.
"If you don't take me, I've no place to go."
How can I trust a man who ran away to save his own life when his master is dead?
What?
Who's to say you won't betray your master again?
That will never happen.
I will give my life for you.
I will give you a chance to prove your loyalty.
Say anything.
I will do anything.
We need to recruit more people.
What do you plan to do by hiring more people when we should be letting people go to survive Madam Jami's advances?
I will send merchants all over Shilla.
I will trade cotton and salt at marketplaces where Madam Jami's influence hasn't reached.
- Julie's webcam.
"It would be too bad if this film were to go around court, wouldn't it?"
"What do you mean, go around?"
"To avoid that, you need to help us."
What kind of help?
- Working for us.
Tell us exactly where Roban is in the Villedieu case.
I can't.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
"Speaking of secrets, you know that Julie is underage?"
"That's crazy, she's in the first year of law school!"
Look.
She's in high school.
You see?
"Must admit, she is pretty talented for a 15-year-old."
"If you refuse to help us, within 30 minutes this film will be sent to every magistrate's mailbox."
"When they realise the girl is underage, they won't do you any favours."
And you will be disbarred for life.
"Harsh, isn't it?"
Gilou!
Tintin!
What's going on?
The Crime Squad has found the guy Gilou argued with at the squat.
How do you know?
- I just know.
"If the guy talks, they'll be able to get to Patricia."
"- Knowing her, she'll talk."
- The Crime Squad can't implicate Gilou.
- The bullet doesn't come from his gun.
"- Wait, Bremont isn't stupid."
He'll know we covered up for Gilou if Patricia says she was with him.
He'll realise I tampered with the seal.
Science is changing the way women age.
This next generation of women will all be GILFs.
[applause]
All right.
All right.
Calm down out there.
"Okay, so, Kiara, what're the kind of things that you might do now that you wouldn't have done in your 30s?"
"Well, for me, I didn't even know what good sex was until I turned 50."
(MURPHY SCREAMING)
ANDERSON:
Where did you learn that?
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!
FITZGERALD:
"Captain, we got a swarm of tree niggers out here waiting to finish the job."
Tell me you got some kind of plan.
Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's running it.
We got to get off this boat.
"Oh, you want to get off the boat?"
"Then what do we do, huh?"
Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
That'll add weeks to the trip.
Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
"They got eyes on you right now, son."
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.
Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Glass knows this territory best.
It's his job to get us home safe.
Get us home safe?
"Okay, gang, take off the mustaches."
"Now, what is it, Schulz?"
"Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva man is coming to inspect the camp and find out whether we are living up to the international convention."
I'm sure he will find that we are treating you very well.
"Now, you must not run around in your underwear."
And take off the wash.
The kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
"Ja, we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs."
The kommandant also sends you clean blankets.
He wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
"Yeah, yeah, we know."
We had them last year.
"Five minutes after the Geneva man was gone, the blankets were gone."
"Uh, the kommandant also told me to pick up the radio."
Radio?
"What radio, Schulz?"
"The one you are hiding in the barracks, don't you know?"
The one your friend mit out the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
"Schulz, you're off your nut."
- Give me the radio.
-No radio.
"All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself."
"Now, let's see."
Where could it be?
Maybe...
Maybe in the lieutenant's bunk?
"Oh, no, not in the lieutenant's bunk."
I'm cold here.
Maybe warmer on this side.
In the piccolo may--
"Oh, no, not in the piccolo."
Am I getting warmer?
She must've overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
"Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do."
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"All right, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go,"
Any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to track a wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
"Oh, yeah."
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know... to know what?
"Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?"
Because I don't want to be this way anymore.
I hate what I am.
If you heard what dr.
"Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't ready."
I had no choice.
"When they kill the other wraith,"
I won't be able to pretend anymore.
Suits you well.
Shit!
"Ok, you wanna see an alien craft?"
You will see it.
Look.
"You know I always dreamt to fuck a dead man, that's my chance."
You're crazy.
Sure I'm baby.
"That's why you like me, so let's fuck him."
-Don't you touch him.
-You want any?
So you fucked twice today already.
Don't do it!
"You don't like it baby, you don't have to watch."
Crazy!
Don't do it.
"Don't get moral with me, whore, you had to fuck him didn't you?"
I told you not to fuck him.
This is my place I do what I want here.
You can fuck any petty asshole who gives you a chance.
You god damn whore!
Don't you call me that you low-class freaking monster!
Monster!
I'm a monster?
"You let these guys walk on your bones, bitch!"
"and you're gonna kill me with syphylis one day, you dirty cunt."
Don't talk to me like that.
"Your mother was nuts, your father was a bum."
You'll never go anywhere but to the Bowery you belong with the bums.
You shut your mouth or I'll cut you baby.
And nobody will fuck your ugly cunt.
Why did you have to do that to him?
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said oranyonelisteningto what he was being told.
and he got a piece of everything they made.
except they were doing it in America.
All they got from Paulie was protection from the guys trying to rip them off.
That's what it's all about.
That's what the FBI could never understand.
What Paulie and the Organization does isprotectpeoplewho can 't go to the cops.
That's it.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.
and they knew I was with somebody.
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morning for fresh bread.
and no matter how many people were waiting
Iwastakencareoffirst .
even though we had no car.
At 13
Iwasmakingmoremoneythanmost of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
I had it all.
One day some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.
You know why?
It was out of respect.
What do you think?
Aren't my shoes great?
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
shut the door.
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
but also feelingmaybeTuddywas right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
I see I must confess.
"When I wrote you that letter, my tender feelings for you so overpowered me"
I could not find words of clarity and persuasion.
I was desperate.
I looked around me for help.
I saw George's book and stole what I needed.
But a year ago this book had not been published.
"Or even written, I suspect."
"I think I've found the truth, for which I thank you, and I owe Madame Sand an apology."
Perhaps now she and I can become friends.
Don't be content with just a little truth.
George will never be content with just your friendship.
She wants your manhood.
"Your virtue, your genius, your soul."
Listen to me!
That woman is a graveyard!
But I can help you.
I can inspire you.
This is the novel and that's the last chapter of the memoir.
- It's a bit on the thin side.
- So's my life.
- Do you know of a good tutor?
- I'll ask around.
"By the way, Mr Chopin came to see me last week."
He asked if you would call on him when you were in town.
Mmm!
Do I hear a duet?
"Perhaps this is not the last chapter, eh?"
"Give me my money, you jackal!"
Madame Aurora Dudevant.
Aurora is the name I was born with.
Aurora.
"I've shown that, haven't I?"
I don't believe I have any ideals.
But you do.
"All that you said to me, the first time we decided to do it about practising what we preach."
I did it to see if we could and then I did it for the pure love of killing.
But you...
I can't help thinking you've done it because of me.
For me.
Yes.
"But I also did it because... because, cos I..."
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.
I wanted to break free of the usual constraints.
"And yes because of you, Richard."
I admired you.
You're not like everyone else.
The rim-ram.
You're unique.
Hi.
"Her name's Carla Burns, lives around the corner."
Looks like she was coming home from work.
"OK, clear."
Anything left in her bag?
There was money still in there.
Doesn't look like a robbery.
"Broad daylight, no attempt to hide the body."
Another victim lying face up.
We've a weapon!
Even as we speak they'll be looking at the body of the woman you killed.
WE killed.
"Our clever friends will be piecing it all together, tying to make sense of it all."
I'm tired of all this Miss Scarlet in the ballroom with the dagger crap.
It's all so crass.
"They both put 100 quid in every month, regularly, no withdrawals."
"Yet last Tuesday at 11:00am, one of the comes into the building society and cleans the whole lot out."
We checked her hours with her boss.
"Last Tuesday, Kelly was at work all day."
She didn't even take a lunch break.
Then it must have been Mr Hartson the loving fiance.
Why clean out the account before they even got married?
They had a row Thursday lunchtime.
You got any idea why Tom wanted to clear out their savings account?
Is that what he did?
Did they row a lot?
A bit.
Lately.
Just put it down to pre-wedding nerves.
You thought there was more to it?
"A week ago, Kelly got home to find the bedding had been changed."
"Sheet, duvet, the lot."
Tom reckoned he'd spilled something over it.
"So Kelly thought he'd had company, yeah?"
Tom had never changed the sheets in his life.
I suggested she bring the sheet in.
For a test?
Yeah.
"She did bring the sheet in the day after, but... as far as I know, she chickened out."
I don't think she wanted to know the truth.
Where is the sheet now?
Did she take it back?
No idea.
It was in her locker.
You got it?
Yeah.
They look like the perfect couple.
I won't let them do it to me.
They won't get anything.
That's how the business is done.
- What is he saying?
- He may say lots of things.
Igor...
Don't do anything to me please.
I would have given you the 500 thousand from the last contract myself if you had called me.
There was nothing between your wife and me.
"I just danced with her, and that's all."
Everything else is a lie!
Did you find any papers with my signature?
"No, we found nothing so far."
May be you should turn to the police officials?
It was a real attack.
So crazy!
I got confused.
Where are the real people?
Where are the images I created?
I'm scared.
May be I shall forget about it all and start painting again.
"I showed promise, didn't I?"
"Garik, you're my best friend."
I need your help.
The situation is difficult but not hopeless.
But if you drink so much you'll get delirium tremens instead of schizophrenia.
You're joking and I don't want to live.
I'm dreaming that I'm King Solomon.
May be you are Tsar Solomon.
May be all your troubles are just a dream.
Solomon was not a bad guy.
I wouldn't brush him aside if I were you.
"I believe it, you know."
"In fact, this brother I visited, Celestino, he was a real hijo de una puta."
I remember the day that I finally accepted it.
But I hated him for so much of my life.
"It was like a dam broke inside of me, releasing a torrent of hatred."
Was that the same dam that released the torrent of bullshit that's comin' out of your mouth right now?
"Do me a favor, tough guy, okay?"
Don't tell me this is about some epic clash between two brothers.
This is about you and your needs.
"Cut to the chase, Gecko, or this will become a feeding ground."
I used to think that she was just a dancing girl.
"But now, now I get it."
She's your queen.
That's why I'm gonna bring her back to you.
Your headliner.
I'm gonna bring you back Santanico Pandemonium.
"Kate, help me move this rack."
Come on!
"Come on, let's go!"
We gotta get out of here!
- [Carlos] Gonzalez!
- Ready?
"One, two, three."
[grunting]
I am trying to be civil here!
- [pounding]
"- You know, maybe..."
- Maybe he's not wrong.
- About what?
About the blood well not being such a bad idea.
It could keep the culebras from killing.
"You don't seriously believe anything he says, do you?"
You're in excruciating pain.
"God, all for a few inches."
Pain and agony for a little bit of pleasure.
I get it.
"If it's that bad, why don't you just stop sleep--"
- Doing what you're doing?
- Because it doesn't feel bad when I'm...
Doing it.
It's good.
It's great.
"And maybe if you weren't so scared of getting burned, you'd feel the same."
"You know, I used to walk tall around here."
I used to walk tall.
Then...
Came George.
He took off at least an inch.
Then Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.
I got shorter.
"All that humiliation, it makes you shorter."
"So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt because one more personal disaster right now would cut me off at the knees."
"So, uh, Valentine's day?"
"Personally, I mean, I think you can't go wrong with jewelry."
"- If you want, I can recommend some local plac--"
- What is wrong with you?
What?
We just took a liver and an intestine from a little kid.
A dead little kid.
And you don't even care.
You're talking about rainbows and relationships and crap.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You don't think that I know that they just pulled the plug on a kid?
"- Yeah, I'd really love to believe you."
"I really would, because I don't even have to go to work this morning."
I would love to believe in a universe... where you wake up and you don't have to go to work... and you step outside and meet two beautiful 18 year-old sisters... who are also girlfriends... and... are also very nice people.
You guys seem like very nice people.
We are nice.
"What would you do... if you believed wewere 18, which we are?"
"Well, I can't even tell ya."
- I can't tell you till you're 18.
- That's not true.
What about freedom of speech and the Constitution?
- What are you talkin' about?
- Free speech.
Okay.
"Well, I don't know what you're talking about... but I can't talk dirty to you... because then I'd be a pervert... and probably even a pedophile too, so-"
- No one has ever talked dirty to us.
- Really?
Sounds very appealing.
I'm gonna go inside now.
Okay.
We'll wave to you.
- Make sure to look.
- I will.
"- Oh, he's probably jerking off."
"- Oh, my God!"
He is.
You can so tell he is.
- How?
- I can feel it.
See that crack?
That's where his hard-on is.
Let's kiss.
Okay.
"Peter Rickman, age 41."
Accident.
"Brought in late afternoon just after you left for the day, Dr. Stegman."
- The patient is presenting...
- I know what he's presenting with.
"I read the papers, Dr. Hook."
How's his nut?
"His ""nut,"" as you say, is banged up."
How severely has yet to be ascertained.
Why don't you run some tests?
I may have to operate later.
Anyone else?
"Sally Druse, age 65, mildly hypertensive... presenting with numbness of the right arm, possible paresis, paraesthesia, or neuralgia."
I've ordered an MRI.
I beg your pardon?
"""M"" as in ""Map,"" ""R"" as in ""Rat,"" ""l"" as in ""Idiot."""
Only one person in this department has the right to order an MRI.
And that person is me.
"- Cancel it immediately, please."
- I can't.
What did you say?
It's already happened.
If you'd been in for early rounds...
"I have disliked your attitude for the last six weeks, since I've been here, Dr. Hook."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Dr. Stegman."
You're insubordinate and arrogant.
I'll have your job for this.
"I think that went well, don't you?"
Aren't you worried?
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already.
"What are you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
"""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
- No.
- Why not?
That's really none of your business.
(Tractor horn plays Dixie)
"Just pull over here, Mr Anderson, and let's talk a little business."
What about instalments?
I could maybe find a deposit.
"No, these things are selling like hot cakes."
I don't really do credit.
"Look, you're a lawyer, right, like Mr Kingdom?"
"That's right, yes."
"My son David and his girlfriend are looking to buy their own place, and I was thinking I might like to help them, by lending them the money."
Very generous spirited of you.
"So, look, why don't you do me a nice quick loan agreement, watertight, and I will let you buy a Whizz."
"An agreement that David can't get out of, that ties him down."
"If you want the car, I'm the only one round here who can help you."
"So, you'll be wanting to say yes."
It's a deal!
(Hums happily)
"Yeah, mate, just click Accept and you're done."
The PayPal account's Millington Consultants.
"OK, bye."
- What are you doing?
(Sighs) I need a Wii.
What?
No-one's stopping you.
"No, a Nintendo Wii."
Seventh generation games console.
"But it's pricey, so I need to make some cash."
- Doing what?
- Tech support.
"""Too thick or old to work your PC?"
"Well, what I meant was, well, you know how important this is to me."
"I think I told you, Mr. Norstaad, that I've been in South America for a good many years, and I've been out of the construction game."
This is my chance to get going again.
"And if you both like the plan, then maybe the Hospital Committee and the others--"
Of course they like it.
Of course you get job.
Just you watch how Edie pushes this through.
Nowhere in the world is another woman like--
"Please, Axel."
Oh.
Of course.
"It gets late, and we should take ourselves home."
"Oh, Miss Morrow, you might like to point out to the Committee that the design for the hospital conforms perfectly to the topography of the land."
"Oh, land."
"Yeah, Edie, you pay over deposit money already?"
"No, not yet."
"But Maigret, he says--"
Don't worry.
"I just thought it was better if Mr. Somers replaced his $50,000 personal check with a certified one, that's all."
"He said he'd have it for me tomorrow, and I'll see it goes directly into escrow."
Good.
"Fine, fine."
"Good night, Edie."
"Good night, Axel."
"Good night, Miss Morrow."
Much obliged for everything.
"I mean it, darling."
You've handled everything just perfectly.
"Good night, Mr. Reed."
[pounding on door]
"All right, all right."
Coming!
NICK:
You want me to go undercover as what?
A member of the 12-step program.
"Aw, come on, captain."
"It makes sense, Nick."
"You weren't at the crime scene, and..."
Nobody knows you're a cop.
"There's a bit of a catch-22 here, captain."
I know.
Your vacation.
"Look, I wouldn't have called you in if I didn't need you."
Tell him.
"They're stonewalling, Nick."
Nobody wants to say diddly about the victim because it's part of their code or something.
It's a dead end.
Unless I become one of them.
Got any bad habits?
Maybe it'd do you some good.
"Nat, what do you think of 12-step programs?"
I think they can be very helpful for some mortal addictions.
How about the more exotic ones?
You know my theory about that.
It's the blood that keeps you from coming over.
"I try, Nat."
"I really do, I really try."
Do you think a 12-step can make me give it up?
"No one can answer that for you, Nick, but it wouldn't hurt you to give it a shot."
When I came here three years ago...
"I was on my knees, almost literally."
I felt like a complete and total failure as a human being.
I hated myself.
I couldn't see any way out of my addiction.
I've made a deal with Jacob.
You should be happy.
"If you're so bored, get another job or a hobby."
Instead of going around making my life hell.
"Fine, as long as I get peace."
Helene!
I must admit it got a little wet.
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- It takes more than that.
- How about a drink?
- It's a little early.
"I've changed the plans a little, so it will take a few more days."
Why?
I can't do that.
I need to be back in two days.
Listen.
Instead of an annual donation -
- I've talked to my advisors about establishing a fund.
It means something to all of us that you're Anna's biological father.
So I'm establishing the fund in Anna's and your name.
You two will decide how the money is spent.
So you've chosen my project?
- I just said that.
- And you want me to do it with Anna?
"Yes, why not?"
She has shown a great interest in aid work.
My advisors have gone through everything and agree   that a sum of 12 million dollars is realistic.
- 12 million dollars?
- I know the dollar is low.
All kidding aside.
"You can quickly see   that it will cover a whole year for 65,000 children."
"Including room, board, school and administration."
The telegram arrived in the morning from Gyula's obituary.
Gyuri got confused totally.
Because it occurred to him that a field postcard came to Tót's address in the today's post.
He remembered well.
Gyula wrote it.
Gyuri did not understand it.
He thought that who can write a postcard may not be dead.
"So, not the telegram valid, but the postcard."
Tót family!
Lajos uncle!
Good news!
A half year was not his so good day!
"Do not bellow, you."
The major lord sleeps yet.
Show me.
- The child.
- Let me see.
Dear my parents and Ágika!
I write this postcard on the railway station.
The train of the major lord before with 5 minutes went away.
"Imagine, the a half year was not so good I day."
"I took a bath and drank beer, the major lord was very kind."
"Please, be cordial to major lord, you make big good one with this for me."
Gyula.
"Ow, let there not be something wrong with him only."
From the cold beer caught cold always.
Do not be scared.
He can look after himself.
Drink.
Well onto..the your kind son's health.
"According to the hygiene that ideal one, if somebody is 8 hours sleeps daily."
"But for who he has to work day and night, in is needed let it have him with 5-10 stole minutes."
You will be connected to the voice mail after the beep.
"To record a message, press one."
"Please speak after the beep, then press the star or pound key."
I see you're not picking up.
"That day, I think I had too much on my mind and I was a bit afraid."
"Actually, I'm sure of myself, but I didn't do you right."
I called you because the sea is so beautiful.
There are so many idiots who take life for granted.
"In this beautiful place I've seen people fight over some money, and a couple argue."
It's disgusting.
You're beautiful.
Very beautiful.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm a film director.
"Oh yes, my name is Kim Joongrae."
"If you're not busy, could I interview you?"
An interview?
"Yes, I'm working on a script."
And you look so much like one of the characters I'm creating.
"I'll offer you some compensation, though very small."
"Oh, no need for it."
I know who you are.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, you do?"
Thank you.
- What kind of interview is it?
- It's real simple.
"If it's okay with you,"
"I'd like to ask about your life, just everyday stuff."
"Actually, I'm not used to this kind of thing."
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we gonna meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we gonna meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.
Thank you.
"Eddie got ahold of something, he wouldn't let go."
Eddie Santos was a pit bull.
"Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid."
What was he doing without backup?
It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down.
He'd never had a problem with him before.
"Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him."
It happens.
Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there?
Because it was his collar.
"He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south."
There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless...
... unlessinterestedparties...
... hadthejudgeintheirpocket.
Walter Stern is a jurist of national reputation.
I don't care if he's Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Somebody got to him.
And based on that one interview...
... youwereabletocome tothe conclusion stated in your testimony?
"- What about, Colonel?"
- I don't wanna let the kitty out of the burlap.
- [Vickers] What's with you?
"- Rest assured, it'll be short and sour."
- [Hutchinson] Shut up.!
- [Chairs Bumping] - [Objects Crashing]
- Cut it out.
- What are you talking about?
- What did I say?
- What's all the hugger-mugger?
Don't ask me.
"I was tellin' him about army opportunities, and he jumps me."
"Don't give me that ""opportunities"" bull."
"I'm a registered nurse, just like all these women here."
"When they came into the army, they were made officers automatically."
"I should've been, too, but they made me a lousy private."
The army won't recognize me as a nurse because I'm a man... so I spend half my time pushing a stupid broom.
"- He's right, you know."
- This man's army is very discriminating.
You bet it is.
"You got a lot of nerve, buddy."
"Look, pal, I don't make the rules around here."
"If the service isn't your cup of joe, fine."
I'm not here to shanghai anybody.
Why bother?
There are plenty of other fish in the barrel.
There's a lot of get-ahead guys that think the army would make a darn-swell career.
"- Not for me, buddy."
Forget it.
- ##[Jukebox.
"Big Band, Ballad]"
"Hey, give me a chance."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dr. Masters."
Yeah.
And now I've kept you here so late.
You must be starving.
There's still-- there's still Chinese in the fridge.
How about I make you a plate?
You probably shouldn't let yourself in here anymore.
Sorry.
"Uh, I can leave my key if you want."
"What are you doing here, Libby?"
"It was my day on the meal rotation, and I thought you might like some braised chicken."
"But maybe I shouldn't be so presumptuous, reading your mind about what you... might want."
"Well, what do you want?"
You.
You were right.
I am-
- I am so sick of pretending all the time.
This is where I want to be.
I don't tell people that-- what a mess everything was when I was growing up.
"Well, a sad childhood is not something people often discuss."
I won't even tell my boyfriends.
"Although some of mine, they actually ended up being like my father."
That's a--
A common phenomenon.
I even felt it a bit when you were angry with me just then.
Felt it?
It made me... drawn to you.
"Well, you know, it's good that you can catch yourself now when you see those patterns repeating."
And it's good I have someone I can talk to about it.
Yes.
"That's good, too."
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the... chapter that you have."
on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
That means I'll have chance to see you again!
"If it's not necessary to return it, I prefer keeping it."
"I can't be his woman,"
"I can't win his heart, now, I love to keep it for memory."
"Miss Shui, why do you like my master?"
"All women want to find a husband who is capable, a man who can protect her."
"Miss Shui, if there is a man, who is a bit stronger than you, but he can protect you, will you consider him?"
"People always look for the best, if I can't find a good husband,"
I prefer not marrying anyone else.
What a decent woman!
Bravo!
"Foon, a man should achieve something in his life."
"You'd better forget loving affair, the world will be your oyster, you'd fight for your future."
Where should I go to fight for my future?
Isn't it all the go?
Yeah...
Really?
Let me take a look!
Isn't it popular in Britain now?
What?
See!
What do you mean?
Look at me!
Look at my look!
Oh!
Look!
You speak fluent English.
It's wise of me to let you study in Britain.
I'm right to bring this present to you.
See!
You look really smart.
Even a deaf guy can hear that... you spoke whole-heartedly.
So you have to look for the open spaces.
"It's really dangerous, but basically, you have to, like..."
"You have to just get, like, aggressive in there."
You know how it is.
"You know, you're like, ""oh, this guy's gonna lag back?"""
"I'm like, ""I will totally get in there."
"You're taunting me."""
"You know, it's like all this stuff."
Do you watch to see who's on the phone
- 'cause you know you can totally jump in front of them?
"- Oh, yeah."
I take photos of license plates when I see people on the phone.
"I'm like, ""amateur hour!"
"Get the [Bleep] Out of my way!"""
That's what I would have said.
You can edit that out.
"Now, as a woman with style, I feel like you probably can tell a lot about a guy by his car."
Right.
What would you think about a guy in a Corvette?
What kind?
What year?
"Let's say a Corvette Convertible, yellow, 2010."
It's not gonna be for me.
That's okay.
[ Laughter ]
"A little older, and then it's sort of ironic and funny."
"And then I'm like, ""this guy's got a great sense of humor."""
Is he wearing...
[ Laughter ]
"""He's got a great sense of humor."
""" Yeah."
Is he wearing a chain?
You're home.
Did you see that there was an attempted robbery at the new mall?
I'm glad I cancelled jack's photos.
I just decided I wanted you to be there.
It's better if we do it as a family.
Is everything ok?
"Yeah,everything's perfect."
"Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to learn the most important lessons of life, one must each day surmount a fear."
When did you know you were gonna have to trick him?
The first time I talked to him.
You realized you couldn't break him?
"Well,I realized he was too smart to have had that nextel phone registered to him accidentally."
He drew us there.
He wanted our presence at gitmo to confirm that he was successful.
And that's when you started moving up the time of his prayers.
"If I'd used an actual clock, he might have caught on."
So it was all a chess game.
We won this round... but you heard him.
Jihad never ends.
Mate.
I quit.
Yield.
Surrender.
Capitulate.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Prentiss.
Sir?
You play?
"Okay, these are for school-- lunch and two snacks-- one to eat, one to trade."
"Oh, and this is for dinner in case your dad makes that chicken thing with the cherries."
- Hello.
I think I will have to strangle them first.
That takes too much energy.
Just push them off from somewhere high.
What about you?
I hate autographs of people who have nothing but money.
"He says he's busy, and he won't even give me time to interview him."
All the data I have is 200 pages of blabber full of spelling mistakes.
He makes it so obvious that he's ignorant.
And I'm just a con girl making 800 pages from it.
It's so annoying.
And depressing.
You should write your stuff now.
I don't think I ever will.
I messed it all up from re-writing.
I can't even write 3 lines in an hour.
I can only write cheap lines.
I can't do it.
Don't do anything for 3 years.
It will come back.
Sounds great!
What am I going to eat?
Tap water and air?
I'll feed you.
I don't have talent anyways.
I'm just going to make a living.
How can you win twice without talent?
There are plenty of writers who win that contest and have nothing to write.
"Anyways, I'm a writer too."
That's how I get paid more for re-writing.
It's ridiculous.
"Oh yeah, I got a new client yesterday, so I paid aunt back."
Ain't I great?
"Here's the thing, you need to protect your family."
OK ?
"Policies start at $250,000."
We offer term or whole life.
You really can't go wrong.
"Think about it, Sally."
"People don't plan to fail, but they do fail to plan."
It's great to see you.
"Sir, may I talk with you for a minute ?"
"Yeah, officer."
What can I do you for ?
You lost your name tag.
I didn't go to this school.
So you go to reunions for the sheer fun of it ?
What is that ?
What is that ?
"Oh, it's a mortality clock."
It shows you how many seconds you have left on this Earth.
"You factor in age, habits, height and weight, and statistics tell the rest."
But the class of '90's going to start dropping around 2055.
So you sell life insurance at the reunion ?
It's a perfect place.
People are all focused on their fading youth.
"I know, it's sleazy, but it's working."
I go to class reunions all over the state.
Our detective said he saw you talking to the victim's wife.
I was consoling her.
How are you holding up ?
Patrick was taken much too soon.
"Jennie, yeah, I wanted to see how she was doing."
I met her when I sold her a policy.
- She bought a policy ?
Bored?
How do you get bored with that?
"For every beautiful woman, there's at least one guy out there..."
... who'stiredof pretendingtolisten to her in exchange for sex.
"Well, let me go on record as saying, I am not that guy."
"If I ever had a woman like that, I would cherish her."
I would worship her. I would...
... starta smallcountryand put her  face on a stamp so I could lick her head.
-Why don't you go talk to her.
"-Yeah, right."
Gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me...
... unlesswe'rein line for the British throne.
-So you give up without even trying?
-Yep.
That's my motto.
Why waste time on 1 0s when you're already getting rejected by sixes?
"Alan, listen to me."
"You are a smart, sensitive, good-looking man..."
... withsomemilkydischarge coming out of one eye...
... butwhoamongstusisperfect?
That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
So?
"Women like Sherri have big, hunky guys hitting on them all day long."
"A guy like you walks up, makes a move, you know what that says to her?"
Trick or treat?
"It says, ""l'm confident in who I am. """
-You think?
-l know.
"So, what if she's not interested."
What's the worst that could happen?
"Actually, the worst that could happen is she points at me..."
It's damn filthy here!
The furniture and the mattresses are all covered in dust.
You beat those out before it starts snowing again...
"Can I do anything else for you, dear Anna?"
"Yes, make it so clean here that one can eat from the floor!"
- Before Karl returns home again...
- When does he come then?
"Then he'll ask me again what you have done in the meantime, and I can lie again..."
"Oh, Mrs John."
I'll get the child right away.
Mother's already in bed...
- Is Mr Hassenreuter there?
"- No, how come?"
Mrs John!
Good evening.
Mrs Knobbe!
"I'm so grateful to you, Mrs John."
That you can look after the little one for a few hours at least.
- It has to stay somewhere.
- Its neverending coughing and crying never lets me sleep.
I have to be on duty at night...
Won't you take a seat?
And all that after the difficult birth!
It's a blessing that it's so dark in the bar.
"Tell me, Mrs Knobbe, for how long have you been staying in bed?"
"For six days, Mrs John!"
Six days and then it's:
"""Out, we need the bed!"""
"Having children is no illness, says the health service."
Not the slightest consideration.
"When it comes to paying, they squeeze everyone."
But he won't let himself be squeezed...
"And just because I am a woman, they do not have the courtesy to tell me where they are going or when they will be back."
I'm a man.
That's right!
Which makes this even worse.
I'm going to Tony again.
(phone ringing)
We're doing our best to keep the investigation closed.
Clayton?
"Uh, no update yet, Mr. Wickes."
We're trying to keep this out of the press.
"The less our shooter knows, the better off we are."
"Okay, we're asking these people to not say anything about what they saw."
I saw a man with a gun.
"Right, I got that."
So you're going to be in this group.
"You're going to answer their questions, then you're going to go home."
Okay?
You're going to lay low and you're going to tell your people that you need some personal time.
"No, I don't want that."
I want him kept separate from the group.
He was standing next to Jarvis.
He had a better view than anybody.
"The gunman, he was wearing a blue hat."
I saw him.
"Okay, okay."
"We're going to put you with a sketch artist,"
You write down everything you remember.
"Of course, anything."
VANCE:
Gibbs.
"Massive blood loss, doesn't look good."
His family's been notified.
Fucking Randy?
Didn't you say he was as funny as a dick pimple?
Randy open mic'd for three years before he got down here.
"You know, he didn't leapfrog 'cause he built some fucking shelves."
That deserves some respect.
You dig?
Yeah.
"Whatever, nigga."
You don't ever get to call me that.
"And if you roll your motherfucking eyes at me again, your head is gon' be rolling after it."
You understand that?
[Al] That's my time.
"Clap for me, please."
Mind the fucking light.
[cheers and applause] [laughter]
I know what you're thinking.
I look like Danny Partridge if his mom kicked him out of the band.
"Wonder if there were some family members that didn't pass the audition, you know?"
"Like, behind the long bus there's a little short bus."
"Poor kid, Patrick Partridge, sitting back there wondering,"
"""Why can't I shake the tambourine or hit the triangle or something?"""
I hear you're having dinner with Roy Brenner.
Yeah.
Somebody was harping in his ear.
Eh.
[laughs]
Thought I'd use the guy's pain.
Little inside information on Brenner.
He doesn't like hard to get.
So do me a favor and quit acting like you're doing him a favor.
You want this.
"You want it more than anyone, so woo him."
"Hello, dear."
Are you all right?
"This is a terrible, terrible time for us, Michelangelo."
"Actually, I'm really not sure that you should still be here."
Poor Dorothy.
Poor Bonnie.
Even if she was a little difficult...
Well...
"She made the people in the backroom suffer, you see, at her fittings."
"The lateness, the screaming, the insults."
"She insulted me, too, often enough."
She had to have this and she had to have that.
Whatever you did was wrong.
"Whatever you paid her, it wasn't enough."
It was a nightmare.
"Of course, it was galling to think that in one day, a so-called day, she earned more than some workers earn in six months or even a year."
"It doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"Well, but then there she was the next day on the front pages."
"You know, dear, my father, he started this business from nothing."
My mother worked all hours.
They both did.
And I was their only child.
I wanted to go to law school.
I wanted to be a politician.
I wanted to change the world.
But how could I let them down?
I couldn't do that.
And now it all seems irrelevant.
Bonnie's family are flying in.
The whole thing is unbearable.
I can't even bear to talk about it.
Not even to you.
I don't want to be up all goddamn night.
- It's decaf.
- Better be.
"Nobody has a secret plan to caffeinate you, Cash."
- I do.
- Forget it.
I can't trust none of yous.
"Hey, mousse, how you doing?"
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm okay."
"Listen, mousse, you know, I don't go in for much emotion."
"I just wanted to say, for what it's worth, that your dad is a good man."
"You know, he served his community, saved a lot of people..."
Yeah.
"And you turned out all right, didn't you?"
"You know, I think if this is his time, he can walk toward the light with his head held up high."
"Small comfort, I know, but..."
"Thanks, Cash."
I appreciate it.
"But I got to tell you, I never really got that ""walk towards the light"" business."
Many people who have had near-death experiences have reported seeing...
I know what they say.
I'm just saying I don't get it.
"Folks find the idea comforting, John."
- I know I do.
- I don't.
"Maybe I'm a distrustful bastard, but how do we know what's beyond that light?"
"Okay, John."
Maybe that light's leading somewhere you don't want to go.
How do you know it's not hell?
"The light for hell would be red, obviously."
"Would it, Stats?"
I don't understand.
"No, no, no."
Please!
"Please, I'll be quiet."
I don't want to go in there!
I promise I'll be quiet.
"No, don't!"
"No, don't!"
"Please, I'll be quiet."
Please!
I want to go home!
Please!
"I wonder what the unsub meant by ""eleven."""
We know he measures the time spent in each house.
It could be some sort of countdown.
"What are you thinking, Aaron?"
The hospital report on Ellie Zumwalt.
Her injuries were minor.
It was the gradual loss of blood that caused her to lose consciousness.
"Well, the unsub must have thought she bled out and left her for dead."
That was his big mistake.
I don't think there was a mistake.
What do you mean?
"What if Ellie Zumwalt was never meant to die, that the mistake that the unsub made was actually at the first crime scene?"
The Brewer murders?
The guy's a family annihilator.
He killed them all.
To me that sounds like mission accomplished.
We didn't understand why he used two different murder weapons on Jim and Lyla Brewer.
That's because there never was a second weapon.
I'm still not following.
"Dave, you said that a large piece of furniture was moved to block the top of the stairs at the Brewer house."
"She's got you on the hop already, mate."
Sit down.
"Look, I..."
I know he's young.
(Bangs around in the kitchen)
"But there's something so special, beautiful."
"I-I tried to resist him, believe me."
I-I tried but...
What we have now is extremely honest and good.
You sure I can't tempt you with a burger?
"Uh, no."
"Come on, we've got marty sauce."
No?
I want to find a way to make this work.
I want to protect him emotionally and care for his academic future.
"Sorry, did you say protect him?"
Yes.
You're delusional.
You think I'm delusional?
"From what Finnegan tells me about you, it sounds like you..."
"Oh, listen Fiona, I know I'm a sinner, alright?"
"I know, because despite the enormity of what you're doing with my beautiful boy,"
I would fuck you in a heartbeat if he wasn't coming back in a minute.
Do you really want to turn him into me?
"The best thing you can do for Fuzz right now, believe me, is go downstairs, get in your car, and get driving and keep driving, preferably until you find some sort of elevated landform, and then keep driving a little bit more, OK?"
"Let's go, Fi."
"Fuck, Dad."
Fuzz.
Fuzz.

"Talking hard evidence, are we?"
"Talking hard evidence, are we?"
"More rumour, to be honest."
But you stuttered yesterday and the day before.
It was on one word.
It was on one stupid little word.
And you know what the word was?
Country.
Country.
And you know why I probably hit that word?
"It was because I was in the presence of Callie, who's a card-carrying c-c-cunt."
[chuckle]
Good for you.
You no longer have a speaking part in the trial.
"Okay, first of all, if I were to stutter in court, which I won't, but if I were, that would only serve to humanize me in front of the jury, which could run to the benefit"
of our very inhuman- and monstrous-seeming client.
"You put me on this case because I'm smart and I'm talented, and I have done great work, thanks to you."
"I've done it-- behind the scenes, maybe, but I-"
- I deserve to be seen doing it.
Shaken confidence does not serve the client or the firm.
My confidence is not shaken.
Mine is.
Come on.
I'm ready for this.
Let me do it.
Please.
You'll still be a valuable member of the team.
And a dear friend.
Are you breaking up with me?
[click]
- Good night.
- Good night.
Callie.
I hear you're back on top with Borns Tech.
Not surprising.
I know I never told you often enough.
You were the best goddamn center fielder in high school.
"And on ice, heh heh, tough as nails."
Not to mention the way you fight fire.
You put every other fireman I ever knew to absolute goddamn shame.
I should have said this shit when I was alive.
"But hell, I'm saying it now."
You are the best goddamn son a father could ever hope for.
You happy now?
- Yeah.
"- Well, get over it."
"Because if you believe all that, I got some land down in florida I might want to sell you."
Now give me a goddamn drink.
"Middletons, not that bottom shelf shit."
He was a pretty good center fielder.
"No bat, hell of a glove."
I'll take the bottom shelf shit.
- Jameson'S.
- What is that with you?
"Budweiser, jameson's, always the low-rent shit."
"Hey, you know what, I like the way it tastes."
I could give a shit about what people think.
He's a great fireman.
No bustin' balls.
He's too risky.
Gets the job done.
"You know how many people would be dead but for him breaking rules, taking chances?"
Lot of kids would be on this side of the bar.
"Most guys, they play it safe."
"Him, he pushes the envelope."
"Like, um, what's his name?"
Who's that quarterback?
Yeah.
Clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.
There were eight.
W-What are you talking about?
I discovered a fourth New York victim...
A man by the name of Pat Crews.
Are you sure?
Phillip Harris only knew about three.
There's a reason he missed this one.
Because this murder took place on the same day The Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.
But how can that be?
Unless...
"There are two serial killers, one on each coast."
[Knock on door]
- [Groans] Who is that?
- Castle:
I don't know.
"Whoever it is, I hope they brought coffee."

- Please come in.
"I expect to be screwed over by an asshat that I don't know, but not from one who's supposed to be my friend."
I take it that you heard about what happened at Austin Elektra's house last night.
You said you'd keep me in the loop.
"Look, we can explain."
"Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon."
And our lab tested it this morning...
it's clean.
Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?
Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse.
"They came up clean, too."
And according to the prop master...
They did it by mail.
- Mail?
-That's right.
"Little love notes between our security officer and von Scherbach with Schulz, the mailman."
Here's the flag.
They used to put a loop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?
And here's the mailboxes.
Hollow black queens.
"Cute, huh?"
"They delivered the mail or picked it up when we were out of the barracks, like for appell."
"And when there was a special delivery they'd pull a phony air raid to get us out like last night, for instance."
There wasn't a plane in the sky.
"Or was there, Price?"
"Brother, were we all wet about you."
Forget it.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you know?
Because I got my own ideas.
Let's have that civilian stuff.
"I'll look pretty stupid in this, yodeling my way across the alps."
"Now, let's have the wire cutters."
- You taking Dunbar?
-You betcha.
There ought to be some reward money from mama.
"Say about 10,000 bucks worth."
"I told you boys, I'm no escape artist."
"For the first time, I like the odds, because now I got me a decoy."
- What's the decoy?
-Price.
When I go I want you to give me five minutes.
Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank.
FredNolanspent more than six decades lookingfortreasure on Oak Island.
ItwasFred who first discovered themysterious collection of boulders knownasNolan'sCross.
Hedidextensiveexplorations oftheisland's strange triangle-shaped swamp.
"Andhealsomeasured and analyzed numerouscarvings, artifactsandotheranomalies thathecollected over the years."
"- I've been at it for so long now... - ...that if I didn't relate this kind of stuff,"
- who'd put it together again?
- Exactly.
"You know, I'm not sure how your father is gonna take it."
"Speaking of which, does he know?"
Not yet.
I think we should go tell Dan.
I'd like to.
"Let's do that, guys."
"Hey,Daniel."
"Hey,Marty!"
"Howareyou,partner?"
-Good.
"So, Dan..."
"I have some, um... some... what I consider to be sad news."
Fred Nolan has passed away.
"Formostof theirtime onOakIsland,Dan Blankenship and Fred Nolan were engaged"
-inanintenserivalry.
- Sit down.
Onewhichonlyseemed to grow even more bitter withthepassageoftime .
"Imean,it waslike the Hatfields and McCoys outhere,so now,regretfully,"
"Fred'spassedon , and it will bring change."
"Imean,thishas alwaysbeen  the Fred Nolan and Dan Blankenship story for 60 odd years and now it won't be anymore."
Do you remember when you first met Fred?
Yeah.
I came up here in '65.
Fred had been on the island several years earlier than I was.
I had quite a few conversations with him over the period of time.
"No, I've been waiting here to apologise."
"Well, well."
"Not to you, not now, but, well, to the United States."
We accept your apology.
Look.
I came here with good intentions and at another time
"I might admit you had provocation the other night, but for a grown man to..."
"Well, it's positively disgraceful and I ruined my best pair of nylons."
"Have you any idea what nylons cost these days, if you can get them?"
"Whatever it was, it was worth it."
"So help me, next time I have a bottle I'll launch that guy."
Hold it!
"Keep trying, Plotski."
Poletski.
"What's the matter, Cookie?"
I got my walking papers.
They're sending me back to my old unit.
You'll be the best cook in the British Army.
Not me.
I've applied for a transfer to the Commandos.
"Hey, you've got something there."
"Not a hope, McKendrick."
I couldn't possibly agree to a transfer.
Look.
Do you realise what it costs to train just one parachutist?
"Over £5,000."
"If I transfer you, what have we got for our money?"
Absolutely nothing.
"There are two ways a man can get out of here, by refusing to jump or feet first."
"Is that final, Sir?"
"Of course, you could refuse to jump."
"All right, you can fall out."
When I see him...
He will still think of me when he sees me again.
"Well, first take the money that we owe him..."
I don't want his money!
"I want...never, I want nothing more from him..."
And his child I don't want at all!
Why should it live?
He himself never wanted it but... he shall see it!
First he shall see it and know how it feels when all is taken from one.
"Then I will kill it and myself, too."
But first I'll go to this shit of a dad and throw the dead kid at his feet!
Let him see how his conscience is dead.
"He'll cry and curse, that dog..."
I don't know where to go anymore.
My employer has fired me.
I have no place to sleep...
"I have no money, no papers."
Nothing.
Nothing at all...
"Well, have the child first, and the rest will follow."
"Going by the laundry, small wonder that he's run off..."
- Did you eavesdrop again?
- My hearing is excellent.
Bring the suitcase to Mrs Kunze.
She has a room free.
She can stay there.
"- Well, when are you due?"
- That's none of your damn business!
For how long should I rent the room then?
- For as long as she works for me.
- Under the table?
With no money and no papers?
They did whatever they wanted.
They double parked in front of hydrants and nobody ever gave him a ticket.
In the summer when they played cards all night nobodyevercalledthe cops.
Tony Stacks.
How are you?
Tuddy Cicero.
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?
Tuddy.
Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria who was the boss of the neighborhood.
Paulie might have moved slow butitwasonlybecausePaulie didn't have to move for anybody.
It's your fault.
You started it!
I started it?
It's your fault.
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.
was sent to work at the age of 11.
He liked that I got myself a job.
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.
Henry!
Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
My mother was happy after she found out the Ciceros camefromthesamepart ofSicily as she did.
To my mother thatwastheanswertoallherprayers .
I was the luckiest kid in the world.
do anything.
and everybody knew me.
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would let me park their Cadillacs.
I can't even see over the steering wheel andI 'mparkingCadillacs.
it wasn't too long beforemyparentschanged their minds about my job at the cabstand.
it was supposed to be a part-time job.
But for me itwasdefinitelyfulltime .
That's all I wanted to do.
"Hutchinson, what would you say to tantalum foil here?"
"- Good idea, sir."
- Oh.
"After all, you're the doctor."
"Hey, old-timer, I'm lookin' for Colonel Potter."
"Could you speak up, sonny?"
My bird and I are a little hard of hearin'.
"Sorry, sir."
"Uh, I thought, uh..."
"Eh, that's okay, Sarge."
I'm subbing' for my company clerk.
- What can I do you for?
"- Sergeant Joe Vickers, sir."
Area retention officer.
I've got the names of your enlistees who are due for discharge.
I wanted to talk to them about re-upping.
I trust you brought your portable torture kit.
"[Laughs] No high pressure from me, sir."
I just wanna point out the big picture.
"You remind me of a ""feller"" who once tried to sell me a dead mule."
Said it'd be no problem to feed and it didn't kick.
"[Laughing] That's a good one, sir."
Uh...
"Oh, I have this, uh, memo for you too, sir."
"As, uh, C.O., you're obliged to try to get your officers to, uh, extend their tours."
You'd better talk to the commander about that.
I'm just the company clerk.
"## [Humming] Oh, Charles."
Read any good books lately?
Professor Hutchinson just came in.
Why don't you go over and thank him for that lesson he taught you today?
"Bandy your japes, apes."
Buy it!
"It will save you time and money, it'll save both because time is money!"
"You can't tie a tube around your neck each morning, that's impossible!"
You need this completely prepared thing.
If there is anything that the Dawes Plan didn't take it's your head... and it should tell you that you need this.
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, buy this, buy!"
You'll purchase cheap and genuine here.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50."
Look!
It doesn't tear or grind nor break.
"Don't laugh, ladies and gentlemen, don't laugh."
I just wanted to show how unbreakable such a small piece can be.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Buy this really genuine piece!
Buy!
How nice that you showed up here!
"- Wait a moment, I gotta get my stuff."
- I'll wait right here.
"Franz, you'd make a great dad."
A man needs a daughter and a son.
Why not?
Would you mind?
You're not getting anywhere.
Just wait and see.
Others are off much worse with their jobs or locked up in Tegel.
"What is it, girl?"
You can sit in a warm and dry place and do whatever you please.
I got something for you.
What do you have?
Nice.
- Where did you get all this?
- Thrift store.
Not that much.
Most people did what you did.
They saved or they paid down debt.
We don't want people to save and reduce debt?
"We do, but when the next guy's president."
- You win.
- I always do.
"Yes, sir."
- I'll tell you what I find interesting.
- What's that?
"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support and you gave $ 1435 to charity?"
I'm not sure that check isn't better off in your hands.
"Oh, I'm taking it."
Don't be ridiculous.
"When you get to your place, you're gonna find a DVD player and that wimp-ass Bond movie."
- Mr. President...
And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
- That was an incredibly nice gesture.
- I'm really something.
Mr. President.
"- Hey, John."
"- Could we have a minute, sir?"
- Yeah.
"- Charlie, get that woman on the phone."
I'm feeling magical tonight.
They're in the tunnel.
The readings show nothing beyond the predictable level of radiation.
"The flatbed's back on its way, and the Carlsbad is behind gates."
- So we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah.
"We pack this stuff in two inches of stainless steel, four inches of lead."
We rammed it with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't gonna protect us from the thing we haven't thought of.
- That's just me.
- Yeah?
"Well, I'm starting... the bottomless trend."
"Hence, the bottomless party."
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.
- Where are you going?
"- Bang bang, buddy."
Listen.
I'm really sorry to bother you with this.
- You all right?
- Not really.
"They were locked up for less than an hour, and they already escaped?"
Damn it.
Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.
Don't need the public thinking we're some two-bit operation.
"Got it, sir."
It must have been either al-Qaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.
Find out if they have any relatives in the country.
You probably should have done that in the first place.
"Do you have a problem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?"
I'm just saying that...
I've looked through the files on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.
"Other than a couple of traffic tickets, they're clean."
Right.
That's why they just broke out of prison.
But they--It's not even clear that they should have been there in the first place.
Shut your--
"You see this cute, little white girl, Beecher?"
Yeah.
"Well, yeah, that's why I didn't tell 'em."
"Growing up, I.A. was worse than the bogeyman in my house."
Then why take the job?
Because I want to be a detective.
"When I passed the exam, they gave me a choice--"
I.A. or back to patrol-- I took I.A.
Double chili cheeseburger.
You want something?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
You hate the streets that much?
"No, it's just not my goal."
I did patrol because it was required.
Then just wait for another department to open up.
For how long?
I've already spent five years of my life on patrol.
Now I'm required to put in two more years on the job before I can even think about moving up to homicide.
Homicide?
That's your goal?
So that's how it is?
I.A.'s just another requirement.
"The minute your time's up with us, you're history?"
And I.A. was always your goal?
No.
But that's completely different.
I was pregnant with my first son.
I had to get off the street.
"I understand, but why are you so upset?"
Because I love this job.
"I may have joined I.A. because of the great hours, but I stay because I believe in what we do."
"Unlike you, I'm not just biding my time."
I am not biding my time.
- Is that not okay?
"- It is, but I might have a date."
"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Should I cancel our trip so you can go on the date you might have?
"No, obviously you should go."
- What's that sound?
"- I don't know, Rob."
- You should be in bed.
- Mom?
That always happens at this time.
You just were never up this early.
"It's the lights, Robby."
See these street lights?
They're run by a big computer that tells them when to go on and off.
That's what that sound is.
"So, forthe purpose of this role-play, Shamus is holding a grenade."
"The juice is a grenade, so the worst thing we can do is act afraid."
"Because Shamus is already scared, and he's taking his cues from us."
We will want to exit in an orderly fashion... telling Shamus with our actions... that he cannot get our attention in this inappropriate manner.
Hey.
Hi.
"So, do you have anything new in the chest?"
"You know, the hope chest?"
- What's the hope chest?
- It's... nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ellen broke up with me.
What?
Why?
She thinks she's gonna die this week.
No.
"Out of everyone at Saint Tod, she is the least likely person to die."
Of course I'm gonna help you.
"Well, what am I, not gonna help you?"
"I just--like I said, I can't, I gotta--"
"I can't, I got the thing."
I-I got a shift.
"Uh-huh, and what would happen to the shift if I said I wanted to fuck you tonight?"
[chuckles]
"Well, I mean... ♪♪"
Could probably get it covered.
♪♪
Hi.
- [clears throat]
- What are we doing?
Diffusing the sexual tension that's ruining our friendship.
"Okay, so, you want this?"
"Well, if this is what it takes for us to become friends again, then yes, but this is a one-time offer only, okay?"
This is for you to get it out of your system.
"Well, what if I need more than one time?"
One time.
"[music continues, muffled]"
Okay.
No eye contact?
"Well, it's a tight space."
"Um, just the fumes are making me gag, so let's, like, move this along, okay?"
A little impersonal.
"Well, I'm gonna throw you a look over my shoulder every now and then like this."
"Oh, thanks."
"That's more of a ""I stole your parking space"" look than it is of, uh, arousal."
"[sighs] Well, I'll keep that in mind, try to make it better."
[chuckles]
This floor is disgusting.
[clears throat]
Okay.
"Look, you stay out of Vegas, and we'll be fine."
"Come now, Samantha."
"If your clients are truly happy, then I pose no threat."
"But when your service is less than exemplary, like with Mr. Harpel there, who I'm sure would have met you at the appointed time... had you only picked him up yourself in a jet, as I did,"
then you become vulnerable to competition.
"Oh, see, now you don't have to teach me how to service my clients."
I happen to be the number one host in Las Vegas.
A meaningless distinction.
What?
"You might be number one at the moment, but you've never had to compete with the best."
"Now that I'm here, you won't be on top for long."
Wanna bet?
A friendly wager might be in order.
Hmm.
What do you propose?
I bet that I can bring in more money than you can in the next 24 hours.
"And we'll even do it on your home turf, the Montecito."
Nice.
And the winner would say that she...
Or he.
Would be Vegas's best.
Why don't we make it interesting?
Please.
"Winner gets bragging rights, loser leaves town."
Deal?
Deal.
[Chattering]
Hey.
Is that the infamous Paul Logan I see at blackjack 22?
Yep.
He seems so...
"- No questions, Your Honor."
"You may step down, Miss Adams."
[Burger] I call Mr. Cyrus Potkin to the stand.
Oh.
I-
- I'm sorry.
"[Bailiff] Just one moment, please."
Will you raise your right hand?
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
And what was all that about?
Perry wanted me to see if what the girl was wearing was really mink.
- It is.
"- Typist in accounting, huh?"
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll check her out too.
- Right.
"- Goodbye, beautiful."
"Oh, miss, tell Mr. Mason if there's anything my wife needs-  you understand."
"- No, I'm afraid I don't."
"Well, there must be a bill at least."
Tell him whatever is necessary to help-- anything--
I'll be glad to manage somehow.
- All--
- I have a little money saved.
"All right, Mr. Potkin, you've positively identified the Sandover car."
You say it came from the cottage and went past you as you were working on your truck in the dark.
"Nearly ran me down, you mean."
Of course I was parked on the only road out.
Yeah.
You heard the written confession of the defendant's husband introduced earlier by the prosecution in order to clarify their case.
You heard Mr. Sandover's statement that he drove that same car
- out to that same cottage.
There are many such interesting and sensational cases.
"Now that we know each other, I'll tell you about it in leisure."
What are you doing tomorrow evening?
Nothing.
Why do you ask?
- l have some work with your father.
A good reason to meet you too.
No place for reasons.
You can drop in at any time.
"I must leave now, Miss Sheetal."
So early?
- Even I have to work for a living.
"And this fool had to drop in now, you see."
Bye!
"Sheetal, meet Vijay."
And she is my daughter Sheetal.
"My dear, he is a daredevil police officer."
I see?
"So, he is a police officer?"
"I don't understand one thing, daddy."
The crime is on the rise day by day.
What does the police do about it?
"Mr Sahney, our police force and the C.l.D has set an example for the world."
"But, this fact is known only by few educated people like you and me."
Fools and illiterate people just ty to find flaws in it.
But we must not take them seriously.
What do you think?
"Am I not right, Miss Sheetal?"
Perhaps.
"But Daddy, if our police force is so effective then why doesn't crime cease?"
"Mr Sahney, if not cease, crime can be reduced."
But the people must also understand its responsibilities.
"Thank you for calling, sir."
"Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away."
"Glory be, commissioner."
What's wrong?
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank has just been robbed.
- By Batman and Robin.
-Saints preserve us.
"Yes, indeed, saints preserve us if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked."
Which apparently they have.
Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed that this happened.
"Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units for the arrest of Batman."
"Hopefully alive, but we'll take him the other way if we have to."
Attention all units.
Be on alert for Batman.
First name unknown.
Caucasian.
"Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks, purple cape, purple cowl and a black bat insignia on his chest."
He has a masked accomplice whose alias is Robin.
Approach with caution.
They may be armed.
"I hate to do it, Caped Crusader, but I have to take you in."
You're on the wanted list.
"My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader."
Don't make me use it.
"Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper?"
Go on and shoot.
I dare you.
"What's happened to you, Boy Wonder?"
Even your voice has turned snarly.
"None of your business, Flatfoot."
"Now, go ahead and shoot, because you'll never take us alive."
"Batman, I'm giving you three to get out of the car with your hands up."
Sorry.
Bad joke.
It's just a laugh riot around here.
This all looks really good.
"Yeah, it's too bad you're leaving."
We never eat like this.
That's not true.
I cook all the time.
Dad...
"I'm sorry, honey."
Let's just eat.
We're not saying we want you to cook more.
"Hell, no."
You remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
That was brisket.
"Yeah, that's my point exactly."
"As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms."
They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or a guardian available.
So I'm now property of the government.
Nickname: 0382965.
"Hey, it's better than death-breath Seth."
Or so I would imagine.
"So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning, and she'll be the one to, uh... to take you to the group home."
"My contact at Child Services got you a room with only two other kids, which is good, because it can get crowded."
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
"And, you know, they do find foster homes for kids your age."
"Yeah, because everybody wants a brand-new teenager."
I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that'll state the obvious...
Seth.
"But we have all this extra room, right?"
We have a pool house.
Educational.
I left to escape my foes here and to confront another foe on the field of battle.
But I realized that my only true enemy had accompanied me all the way.
Who was that?
"Welcome home, brother."
You've changed.
Though I cannot yet see how.
You soon will.
How is your wife?
"Oh, you know her."
Bouncing through life.
"Well, that was fun!"
"Can't possibly see the King now, unless he likes being vomited upon."
You must see a doctor.
Tell His Highness to come immediately.
That's really not necessary.
I'm certain it was the pastries I had last night.
"Your Highness, you must see a doctor, given all that's happened of late."
"Oh, I see."
"Yes, perhaps, you should call for a doctor."
An invitation from the King.
An invitation from the King.
You must send a message to my dressmaker and the Monseur Cornereau in Paris.
Tell them they must come to the palace immediately.
Monsieur Cornereau?
"He makes fireworks, you idiot!"
"Queen of Versailles, that's what he called me, and I'm going to show him how Queens welcome home their Kings."
"This is most heartening news, Sire!"
I was deaf to your advice.
I shall not be again.
Even the Lord Jesus was lost in the widerness.
"In three weeks, we shalll celebrate Easter, Sire."
Do you have any idea why he left?
I'm not sure.
I'd only be guessing.
You hesitated.
Why?
I don't know.
You know what he did during that year and a half?
"He was in the Navy, he said."
"Do you imply that he came home from the war, from combat duty just to beat you up?"
"-We object, your Honor!"
The defendant has implied no such thing.
-Sustained.
-Did your stepfather... own the house you live in?
-My brother and I fixed it up.
"-Answer the question, please."
-It wasn't a house when...
"-Please, answer the question."
Yes.
"But it was a dirty shack, and nothing else!"
"But you had the freedom to come and go, and... invite boys in... and answer to no one while Lucas was gone, didn't you?"
"Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!"
"When you thought he was going to change all that, did you kill him?"
No!
Lucas was drunk and tried to beat me!
"The coroner testified... that Lucas was unconscious from the first or second blow... so you'd say you'd end the beating then, but you didn't stop."
Why?
I don't know.
You kept beating him until you crushed life out of him.
Why?
I don't know!
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
He appeared before me first time I presided over the moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
Is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge and you're sitting here rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, Captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry...
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
"Please, you know this is the last thing I wanted to do."
Then get the hell out of Internal Affairs and get yourself an honest job.
"Last month, I had to lay him off, two weeks shy of retirement."
Lawrence did not take it well.
What the hell was that?
"Doc, I don't have all year to figure this out."
I told you I needed to study Wickes.
You just watched him for two hours.
Yes.
And then you blocked my view at the critical moment.
"First mention of AUTEC, all I saw was the back of your big fat head."
I can't even confirm now that he was involved in the blackmail.
Looks like Ridgeway might be.
"Oh, you think Wickes was rattled enough to give up a partner just like that?"
"Or he's just telling us what he knows, and he's innocent."
I didn't try to block your view.
I didn't try to ruin anything.
That's it?
Is that all you have to say?
No.
Lawrence Ridgeway.
TONY:
Say hello to Lawrence Ridgeway.
"A spry 62, and loving it."
"Third-generation steelworker, hired at Wickes Steel when he was just a kid."
"Dedicated employee, sort of like yours truly."
"By the way,"
I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in the SECNAV op.
Thank the Doc.
She's the one who chose you.
"Yeah, I thought your game show host quality would be good for the stage."
Ziva?
ZIVA:
Ridgeway has had a rough year.
- Just the AV guys again.
"DC Sonic, they're replacing the surround system in the theatre."
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...
She's coming back tonight?
"Carol, is she coming back tonight?"
"Yes, sir."
Wheels down at 1845.
"Yes, of course."
"As many of you are well-aware, this is my last week here so I wanna make this clear to everybody:"
If there are any congratulatory cakes or any of that nonsense I will be compelled to use deadly force.
I hate you.
I hate you all.
Thank you.
No incendiaries in the White House.
"All right, baby, I just gotta get my weapon real quick."
"You're gonna have to sign out, sir."
Hello.
You guys here for the tour?
Do you think we can see where you'll be working?
"- Yeah, sure."
- Great.
"Gather around, everyone, gather around."
My name is Donnie and I'll be your guide today as we take a walk through American history.
"I wanna give you all a warm Washington, D.C. welcome to the White House where each year we get millions of guests from every corner of the globe."
Where are you folks from?
"Washington, D.C."
- Bad choice.
"What about you, ma'am?"
- Nebraska.
What brings you to the White House?
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
The baseball spring training for his Mets.
That Bill's a lucky man.
"You Russians, you got all the angles, you come over here, you bust your ass."
People are people.
Look at you.
You got every excuse to be in the bottle... and here you are designing websites.
What do you mean?
What excuse?
-Your--
"-No, what?"
"Come on, you know, that--"
My leg.
Of course.
I don't think of it right away.
There are worse things.
...digital countdown timer with automatic shut-off.
"Simply put your food in and set the timer, walk away."
Your new George Foreman Grill will tell you exactly... when your food is grilled to perfection.
This grill does all the work for you.
With my exclusive 20-minute digital countdown timer with auto....
"Heroin, you got only one option."
"A dog you love catches rabies, you put her out of its misery, Anthony."
Salute.
"So what do I do, Uncle Jun'?"
"The feds get him in his condition, who knows what he's liable to say."
"You go on trial, like me, you won't sleep at night."
All the more reason to clean him up.
"Still, he's...."
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else....
It reminds me of people's feet.
I don't know if I can do that other thing.
"If the d.A. Finds out ann dated him,"
He'll use it to make ann look like a prostitute.
Don't worry about al stirling.
I'll take care of him.
"I said we'd get paid for this case,didn't i?"
"Alden, handle the physical evidence."
See if the knife wounds are consistent with self-Defense.
I'd rather work with ann.
Her testimony will be our whole case.
"No,do the scientific evidence."
You do that better than anybody.
"Besides, you think she's a hooker."
"No,i don't,ron."
I've seen her place.
I think she's just a college girl that goes out
"With rich men so she doesn't feel like a loser... and she's hiding a gawky past, which i understand."
I've been that.
Okay.
Let alden take ann.
I'll take the physical stuff.
Ann's parents are coming in from nebraska.
I hate the families.
You handle 'em.
I'm going to see al.
"That was nice, him pardoning you,al."
"Well,if you'd handled my tax case,"
I wouldn't have been convicted.
"I told you, ""stop stealing from people."
"But if you're going to steal, pay your taxes."""
"It was free advice, but did you listen?"
So you know ann diggs.
I took her to some laker games.
What's with the gym bag?
"Just got back from a ""Boxercise"" class at the gym."
"""Boxercise""?"
What kind of queer shit is that?
- I'm learning self-defense.
"- You wanna learn self-defense, you come to Daddy."
"I mean, all during the '60s, before I met my whore wife, I was a boxer."
They called me Frankie Fast Hands.
"Frankie Fast Hands, everybody."
"Yeah, keep livin' in the past, Dad."
"Is this about that stupid Million Dollar Baby movie, Dee?"
"No, actually, Mac, it's about being left with a mugger... because my chickenshit brother and his friends ditched me."
- You ditched your sister?
- Absolutely.
- With a mugger...
- The guy had a knife.
Of course we did.
What were we supposed to do?
"If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique."
Technique don't mean shit out on the streets.
Guys have knives.
Yeah.
"In boxing, there are rules."
"On the streets, we ain't got no rules."
Ain't no rules out on the streets.
"- You guys got no rules on the streets, you."
"- Oh, please."
"Will you stop talking about the streets... you three jackasses, like you've been there?"
"I mean, any underground street fight in Philadelphia, you'd find tons of technique."
- You think you could teach me?
- In a month I'll have you kicking all their asses.
Right.
Where did he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes.
A headpiece like that one.
Except around the edges which were rougher.
"In the center the Frenchman had a bit of a crystal... and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They've made the calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig."
Out away from the camp.
"The well of the souls, uh?"
"Come, come, look!"
Look here!
"Sit down, come!"
Sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning...
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
What about the height of the staff?
Did Belloq get it off of here?
"Yes, it is here..."
"This was the old way, this means six kadams high - 'about seventy-two inches'"
Wait!
And take back one kadam... to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
I'm not sure.
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
I like cows.
That's not the point.
It was its own point.
Go on.
I'm a scientist.
My ability to think is my bread and butter.
"I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
"Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years."
My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
"Okay, I'm still trying to work this out."
How did Penny meet an astronaut?
I don't know.
The regular way people meet astronauts.
Most of those guys live in Texas.
"Obviously, this one doesn't."
Okay.
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.
"People meet, Howard."
God!
Fine.
"You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that."
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.
"Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't."
"Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?"
I'm sorry.
What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
"But there are better homes for those boys, elsewhere."
This is win-win.
"Good for the orphans, good for Charlestown."
"That Newman Home, it's as old as our city."
Old being the key word.
Your town is a rotten relic.
"Now, you can be seen as the man who finally helped save it, or be blamed for standing in the way of progress."
"Rest assured, there will be progress."
Why don't we have a meeting of the council before you leave town?
- Good idea.
- Super.
"- Good night, Your Majesty."
- Bye-bye.
Elbow to the head.
Elbow to the head!
"Show some bite, Hounds."
I'm warning you.
Do not make me come down there.
Do you know that golf is the world's number one vacation sport?
The average course provides hundreds of jobs.
And a pro-tour stop could mean millions of dollars in revenue for Charlestown's businesses.
A vote for Frazier Point is a vote for the future.
"And it's good for the poor little orphans, too."
"Can't wait to move into a good home, Ms Bernie."
"- That's right, Tommy."
- It's Timmy.
Timmy.
Frazier Point is a hole-in-one for all of us.
"That lady's not going to take us away from here, is she?"
You see these?
See these?
"Nothing gets by me, okay?"
We heard that you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us in.
I heard that you are Manwol pirates.
Is that true?
Yes.
Do you know the whereabouts of Yum Moon?
"I saw him in Yongeum, but I haven't seen him since."
How can we trust you?
"It's the head of Yong-su, the leader of the Manwol pirates."
"He refused our plea to surrender, and tried to go under the command of Head Chief Yum Moon."
It is a head.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
- Do you accept those terms?
"- Yes, sir."
We will attack Chunghae now.
We must kill Jang Bogo and his security officers to avenge the master's death.
Go to battle!
To battle!
ANGELS IN FAST MOTION
I'm a pusher frau from Jutland.
I'm having my period.
"It gives me a stomach-ache, and I feel nauseous."
I've got 1800 grams of hashish taped to my body   and then this happens...!
Asger had said there'd be no police.
He promised me there'd be no police.
It never went wrong before.
First I take the train to Copenhagen and then on to Christiania to get the stuff from our dealer.
- How are things in Jutland?
- Okay.
And here?
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are....
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Maybe it's where he was planning on taking his victims.
That's what I was afraid of.
Check this out.
That's a body.
What is it?
This is the fallout to his confession.
"What do you think, he was making Putnam watch it?"
STEVE:
That's exactly what I think.
And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.
"Thought we had lost you there, cuz."
(groans) Get off me.
What happened?
You don't remember?
We were just floating out there on that life raft.
And I spotted land.
That's right.
"You were so excited, you jumped up and lost your balance."
"By the time we got you back in the raft, you had swallowed so much water, that you passed out."
Doc had to do mouth to mouth to get you breathing again.
MAX:
Ah.
"Glad to see you back on your feet, Captain."
Where the hell are we?
"Now, that is a good question."
My best bet is we're on one of the uninhabited islands of the Hawaiian chain.
Most likely Lehua.
Lehua?
"Now, all we have to do is survive until we get discovered."
"Fortunately, I had a have a head start on building the fire."
I did it while you were unconscious.
At least we'll be warm while we starve to death.
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goody bags in your room - and other essentials.
- Are you going to tell me who you are?
"- You'll have to wait till tomorrow, now."
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red.
And don't be so cheeky.
Are you bursting with curiosity about the new recruit?
Yeah.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, no - when you decide the time is right."
- You know me so well.
- He's not gonna do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
- So when do you put him to work?
- I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
"Well, let's go eat and you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
- How's the cat?
"- What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one in them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
- You remember that?
- It was clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
That's quite the Friday.
"Trick, a pint, please."
"The Ash, he's pissed, huh?"
"I told him you got there after and that we both arrived too late, so you're off the hook."
So you covered for me?
This Jenny thing's a serial killer case.
It's scored me some big points in the cop world for breaking it.
Let's just say it's returning the favour.
Cheers.
Yep.
- Still a douche.
"- Well, at least he's not a thief."
I seem to be missing a 300-year-old bottle of buckthorn mead.
You Fae and your funny words.
Look at the time.
I should be going.
Stay and let me tell you how that bottle came into my possession and why it meant so much to me.
So I was thinking.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
- No. it's good.
Listen as recent events have suggested mixing emotions and sex can get kind of messy.
- That is what I was trying to avoid.
"- Yeah, well, I get that now."
"My offer does still stand, though."
I'm here whenever you need me.
How about for more than just healing?
- How about for fun?
- For fun?
Yeah.
"There's this ""friends with benefits"" thing that I have heard so much about."
- You don't say.
"Yeah, and you're actually kind of perfect."
No.
It's all right.
It's fine.
"Come on, come in."
"Um, I got your tea if you want me to make you some."
Sure.
"Yeah, that'd be nice."
"Of all the dozens of women you've been with, you must have fallen in love plenty of times."
Right?
What's this really about?
Neil.
"His, um, his other job..."
"We're working on being more open, but this little voice inside my head isn't so sure."
"So if I fell in love with you,"
"Neil could fall in love with one of his dates, too."
"Grace, you were the only one."
"Come on, I'm serious."
You don't do what I do and catch feelings.
It's the ultimate transgression.
You were it.
So you just sleep with all these women and you never feel anything intimate?
In passing.
It's that way with a lot of people.
Clients and escorts.
That's the fantasy.
That's... that's why this business is booming.
"When I met you, I was hungry for something more, emotionally."
But you were never going to leave Neil.
"It took me a while to figure that out, but..."
Neil's gonna be seeing someone tonight.
Someone I selected.
But I don't want to be the wife who sets rules and tells him what he can and can't do.
"Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade."
"So, wait."
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
"I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint."
Wow!
I can...
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...
"Oh, you think you are so s..."
"You can't decide how to storm off, can you?"
(exhales sharply) I am... (somber music plays)
(crying) Luke's first haircut.
He gave me bangs.
"- Well, that's it."
- (music shuts off)
Hopefully you're all cried out.
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow to catch the tooth fairy?
(sobs)
"Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation."
"Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face and wrap it up."
"Do you guys remember that ""Luke Loves Daddy"" rap?"
(rapping) ♪ My name is Luke Dunphy ♪
♪ And I'm here to say ♪
♪ I love Daddy ♪
(sobs)
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.
"Dad, please, you really got to stop."
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!
(sobbing loudly)
Ohh!
(sobbing continues)
"Mama, now my tooth hurts."
"Unless Emilie has come back to life, the meeting will begin in a minute, with or without you."
- I'll contact the Ministry of Justice.
- Do that.
I was about to suggest it.
- How the hell did he get away?
- I don't know.
- They're still looking for him.
- You were right.
Emilie wasn't shot.
She wasn't there.
"They're searching his car for clues,"
- What the hell have you found then?
- Louise Hjelby's crime scene.
It seems she was picked up by her killer in a black car on her way home.
"He took her to an old boat builder's yard, where she was held captive and abused."
- Then he faked a suicide in the harbour.
- And the perpetrator found this place?
"He's trying to find whoever did it, with a notebook he's acquired."
- What notebook?
"- A bay was writing down license plates,"
The perpetrator took the book from Borch.
- The Zeuthens have just arrived.
- How did Borch get that book?
You'll have to ask Borch or Special Branch about that.
There was a reason.
I'd like to explain.
I don't want...
We've searched the dunes and the beach with a team of dogs.
- They lost the scent by the stream.
- He's on foot.
He's wounded.
They think he followed the stream inland.
They're like d--dustbin lorries.
He goes round picking up every bit of rubbish he can lay his lobes on!
They're a lot nicer ears than many I've had to see to.
"Now, listen."
"As the person you're supposed to be engaged to,"
I don't much like this comparison of some of the things you've had to see to!
And I can well understand why!
"""And I can well understand why."""
"Granville, now listen."
Stand there.
"The minute Nurse Gladys Emanuel goes into her house, you're out again on the street."
"Oh, dear."
"Look, she's been caught by Mrs Pendlebury."
"Oh, dear!"
"She's a very peculiar sh--shape, is Mrs Pendlebury."
Can't be very convenient for Mr Pendlebury.
He often comes in here quite late of an evening for his six--pack of ale with a desperate look in his eye.
"She'll be there for half an hour, you mark my words."
"Ah, good."
A reprieve!
At last I've had a reprieve.
-
"- Not for long, Granville."
-
"- Oh, 'eck!"
Do I have to go out there?
They'll only laugh at me.
I know they'll only laugh.
"Come on, chin up!"
"You come from proud stock, lad."
"Waterloo, the B--Battle of Britain, the Glorious Double Gloucesters!"
"We are a stubborn race, when the chips are down."
And what have you got?
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
- How could that possibly matter?
"- What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
- It means everything.
- What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
You think you're not a part of this?
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
- Safety's off.
It's good to go.
- I don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
The pressure's off.
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?
"All last week, I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest."
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem.
Same names.
Which did not reflect well on their mothers' imagination.
- Mother.
- Mothers.
There were two Clems.
- 'Cause they were brothers.
"- Yes, so they had mothers."
You're drawing me into your drunken world.
"It's not a bad place to be, my friend."
Tank's empty.
- What is this?
- What?
This life plan book thing.
A gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College.
"Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?"
If you can't remember where the living room is.
I'm still good.
"Okay, here's an interesting question for you."
'Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?
'
"They're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure."
"I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock them out... and have nanny catch them and care for them... make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come near them... and then return them to me when they're 21."
What about me?
You are my favorite eldest child.
"Left or right, Sir?"
Left.
"Your left or my left, Sir?"
"But sir I came thought here, there are two doors... shall I go through here or there?"
Where is he?
"Brother, Buy a underwear."
I don't want it.
"Buy a underwear, It's awesome."
"I said, I don't want it."
"Buy it, once you wear it you'll become superman."
"Wear it and fly, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and fight, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and climb Kutub Minar, it won't rip off."
Jump off the Kutub Minar your everything will be ripped off but the underwear will stay the same.
This is the guarantee of Laxminarayan.
But your voice will rip my brain off for sure.
Should I write it down?
I already have one.
You have one!
Then you should wear it.
How do you know that I'm not wearing underwear?
You know about my nature.
And this is Laxminarayan Three.
I can tell the topic of letter by looking at the envelope.
I can tell the size of the son by looking at the father.
Wow.
He's been selling undergarments since he didn't even wear undergarment.
He's made a undergarments factory.
Bulbul loungewear.
What is this?
Who are these slim girls?
"Dad, they are our brand models."
- We were miserable together.
"- Yes, I kind of feel that way myself you know, Marie and I."
"See a couple of months ago, we had this big set- to and I moved out for a couple of days."
And I just found that--
I just couldn't imagine being separated.
"But I think I gotta really try to imagine it even with the kids, because we're really unhappy."
I'm not telling you it's easy.
It's not.
I'm not having a great time.
"With you, there were no kids involved."
"That's true, and I do miss her."
"But the interesting thing is, I found out a lot about myself."
"I mean, it doesn't make you happy."
Divorce doesn't make you happy.
"But in a weird way, it's made me eligible to be happy more than I ever have been in my life."
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
"I don't know if that will help you or what, but...."
Yeah.
It helps a lot.
"- Thanks, John."
- Yeah.
[COUGHING ]
You gotten the cold from hell yet?
- Maybe after we've spent time together.
- Let's get through this.
- They'll hit us hard on probable cause.
- Let's do it.
"On October 7, did you have occasion to arrest Julio Ortiz?"
- I did.
COSTAS:
Tell us the circumstances.
"No, there's no time."
"- Listen, I need a favor."
- What?
I need money.
How much money you talking about?
$2 million in cash.
"How about I throw in a Ferrari, man?"
"I'm serious, Isaac."
"Don't matter if you are, I don't have it."
Is there anyone else you know who might have the money?
"Well, ain't nobody got more money than the cops, so try them."
They busted a big heroin deal last week.
I heard they ceased 100 kilos and the money for the buy.
They got $4 million in cash.
"All right, so where would the cops be keeping the money?"
"No, I wasn't being serious."
"Where, Isaac?"
It's at the main precinct on Third.
"It's probably in some evidence lockers, but, look, ain't no way you're getting it out of there."
"Yeah, we'll see about that."
"No, look listen, listen."
"That money is surrounded by a hundred cops, all right?"
All kinds of security down there.
"Isaac, I got no other options, man."
So Nicole was right.
What?
"She, um, said you've been having issues since you got out the army."
That you're not happy.
She told you that?
Yeah.
"She thinks you miss what you was doing over there,"
"All the fighting, killing or whatever."
The Army has a new mode of transportation.
Did you hear about it?
Feet.
-Wise guy.
"-Oh, on the double."
"Hey, what's the-- here."
"Formation, on the double, hee-yah, line up."
"Ever-Everybody, look alive!"
"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll only take a minute of your time."
I wish to discuss the motor pool and the work... (chuckling):
Work.
"Now, look, men, I don't ask you to kill yourself, but every once in a while, move a little."
"In case an officer walks by, he won't mistake it for a painting."
"And Zimmerman... didn't get those brake drums on the half-trucks yet, did you?"
"-Well, you know, Sarge..."
"-Oh, I know."
"You've been too busy washing officers' private cars at a buck a throw, right?"
"-Well, Sarge..."
"-Get into those fatigues, down to the motor pool, get those brake drums, and out of here!"
There's been a lot of goofing off going around here.
This has got to stop!
Day sheet in yet?
HENSHAW:
Yo.
"Paparelli, you draw guard duty tonight."
I know.
What's this?
"""Permission-- ten days leave granted to..."""
"Oh, when it comes to asking for a furlough, they're right on the ball."
Let's see which meathead this is.
"""Ten days leave granted to Sergeant Ernest Bilko."""
I got it!
It calms his angry soul.
"You want to ask me about Trina, don't you?"
"No, I just wanted to say sorry for..."
"You loved your wife, didn't you George?"
You were happy?
"Well, we had our moments, but..."
"But yes I did, and um..."
"Yes, we were..."
Yeah.
I loved Trina too.
I don't think she ever really loved me.
Not really.
Deep down inside I always hoped she'd come back.
Even after all this time.
"You were the one who sent the postcards to the kids, weren't you?"
"I know people, plumbers, from all over the world."
"We talk, plumbing, you know, online."
I'd get them to send blank postcards from their country.
I'd copy Trina's bit of scrawl as best I could.
"Christmas cards, birthday messages, love Mummy."
And then I would courier the cards back to my plumbing mates and they'd post them.
I didn't want the kids to think that she'd just left them.
Forgotten them.
"It's bloody stupid, really."
I probably just made things worse.
You were trying to do something good.
We try to make up the loss as best we can.
"Yeah, well sometimes it's just not enough, is it?"
"It gets better, Bill."
"Not every day, but... ..trust me it does."
You hung another one of my paintings.
Yes.
"Corporal Barbella, you're a dreamer."
"Now, look, you guys, you got to get on the ball."
You understand?
I want guys that want to soldier.
"You soldier for me,"
I'll interfere with the old man for you.
I-I...
What is that?
I cannot...
You making faces behind me?
What are you doing?
"Now, look, if you guy..."
"You know, Sergeant, some of the officers paid me for washing their car, and I figured if you're still running the snack-in-the-sack raffle, can I have a couple of shots at it?"
-(overlapping chatter)
"-Me, too."
"Yeah, me, too, Sarge."
Two tickets for the next dance.
-Put me down for the motor pool.
-Two tickets.
"All right, is this the suite?"
"Yes, sir, the adjoining room is right through there."
Is that all the flowers they got up here?
"-Oh, I'll get some more, sir."
"-Oh, never mind, we'll rough it."
"Hello, get me the main desk."
"All right, get that champagne spread out, get those cigars laid out..."
"Hello, main desk."
"Uh, look, there may be some poor souls wandering around the lobby looking for Squad ""B"" reunion-- ""B,"" ""B"" like in ""Bilko,"" yeah."
"-Send 'em up to suite, uh..."
-BELLHOP: 32C.
"32C on the double, look alive, hey... all right, good-bye!"
-You got the champagne out there?
- He wouldn't have been pleased.
- Of course not.
He didn't like revolutions.
"Still, he was like a brother to me."
"We always liked the same women, but never the same politicians."
At least you don't take after anyone in your family.
That was excellent.
My compliments!
The worst is over.
"One more day, and who knows what would have happened."
I think you'll be able to get up again in a week's time.
"Give him some more morphine in an hour, but be careful with the dose."
Wait a minute.
Can't I do that myself?
Don't be silly.
I've been working in hospitals for 20 years.
I've seen worse things.
"Thanks, Pablito."
I don't believe it!
You should know you can't smoke in a hospital.
I'll go and relieve Getullio now.
I don't think there'll be any trouble here for a while.
You deserve a drink.
"Don't worry, it's not Communion wine."
Cheers.
"It's strong, isn't it?"
The Campesinos distil it illegally.
- Aren't priests banned from drinking this?
"- Yes, but some do worse things."
- When will this insanity be over?
- When we've succeeded.
"I'm really not opposed to your revolution, Mariá, but what makes me sad is that you use the same violence as them."
- Right.
- Grant would have slapped your face.
- He did once.
"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and, Mr. Vice President, I couldn't care less."
- But what about the campaign?
- What about it?
- President just got past an honesty issue.
- He's not past it.
- If it becomes public...
- That's a big assumption.
"No, it's not."
I think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done talking about the ticket.
The president wants the vice president to remain the vice president and he wrote down his one and only reason.
"""Because I could die."""
"Well, of course, he's right, sir."
It doesn't solve the problem of the electoral math.
I don't know what the field will look like after Labor Day.
"It'll be shaken up, but right now the math's tough."
"And I know you all think he's a punch line, and I know why."
But I disagree.
They're sure running the right guy against us.
Am I the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler and a hockey goal might get the job done?
I don't know.
I'm open to new ideas.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
"- Page me with the result, okay?"
"- Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss."
"Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon."
"The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff."
Keep me apprised of his condition.
"- Okay, the last one."
- Can I go see him now?
No.
We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
- They' re not doing anything.
- Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
"Six days a week, 10 hours a day."
Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They' re really happy though.
"I mean, she's lucky to have him."
- He's a good man.
- Luka no fragments in the x-ray.
Ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Put Polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed-off.
Too busy for personal hygiene?
"When I am focused, I am focused."
"You know, McGee like them gamey, but I'm not sure he'd go for this one."
"Oh, I clean up nice."
Why don't you put the computer down and step out here?
"Let's go, Animal Kingdom."
Come on.
"So, who are you working with?"
"Ah, um..."
I don't know.
"Well, we know some stuff about the blackmail and about the AUTEC account."
We also know that you're in cahoots with someone inside Wickes Steel.
Um...
Did you just use the word cahoots?
I did.
Nice.
"All right, somebody hired me, through Wickes, but, uh, I don't have a name."
Didn't want one.
Was it Ridgeway?
Did you kill him?
I don't kill people.
I hack.
I haven't really left the van.
No kidding.
"Next time, hacker, why don't you crack a window?"
This is all of Baylor's computer hardware.
No sign of the rifle used to shoot Ridgeway in her van or in the apartment.
"Abby, you do know that AUTEC is just a facility where they run tests, right?"
"No, Tim, it is a potluck of the unexplained, and this scientist is eating it up; you know why?"
Because there's a lot of really important things that can't be explained.
"Like what, Abbs?"
Like Atlantis.
Sorry.
I had a little bit of a kitchen accident.
"I was trying to get an avocado pit out, and I did the stab method instead of the chop."
- Took off like half my--
- Ahem!
...but I'm good to go.
I know.
I'm here.
"I'm here, you're here."
"Let's do this, right?"
So I am Patty Solis-Papagian.
I represent Jason Larson.
"So two years ago,"
"Ryan Larson, father of Jason, employee of Borns Tech, blew up on a boat owned by the defendant."
What was he doing on the boat?
"Well, he was dumping explosives into the ocean."
Completely illegal.
"Now, what were these explosives that he was dumping?"
"Well, they were parts of an illegal weapon that was being made by Borns Tech."
Get this: we have video of the explosion.
"Not only do we have video, we have the blueprints and the model of the weapon."
We found them buried in his backyard.
Guy had them buried in his backyard.
"At the end of the day,"
Borns Tech is no good.
- [clicking]
"- They're just no good because they do dangerous things with hazardous materials, and they don't care who it affects."
They could care less.
And this is a trend that happens with big corporations all the time.
Your Honor?
"Ford with the Pinto,"
"Big Tobacco, NFL with the--"
-Mrs.
Mackenzie...
She committed suicide over the kind of life Lucas brought them to.
We're not concerned here over Mrs. Cross' suicide.
But I don't see why not.
There was something terribly wrong in the Cross family life.
-Mrs.
"Mackenzie, if you please..."
"-Something wrong when a woman... had to raise her daughter up almost alone and trying to help her, and..."
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-...not being able to help.
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-Not being able to give...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I'm aware of your deep concern over the suicide... but that's not the point at issue."
Did your daughter ever tell you she had seen Lucas beating Selena?
No.
Don't you think that if she had seen such a shocking incident... she would've mentioned it to you?
-I don't know.
"-Well, wouldn't she?"
Well...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, didn't your daughter ever bring home her problems?"
How many times do I have to answer your questions?
Until we find out the truth.
The truth is... my daughter did bring her troubles home... and I wouldn't understand.
"Well, if she did bring her problems home, did she ever... I wouldn't understand!"
The court will adjourn for a short recess.
Come in.
-What have I done to Selena?
-You had no choice.
But I did have a choice.
We could've picked them off easy.
"Jacoub, we're good, if we stay in this direction, yeah?"
"Yes, that way."
No point in rescuing Clare if we can't all get out again.
"You do want to get home, don't you?"
See your wife?
"That's a wedding ring, right?"
What about kids?
Got any of them?
"Okay, no kids."
Your marriage is shit.
That's starting to make more sense...
Don't fucking shrink me!
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
I know self-loathing when I see it.
How reckless that can make a man.
That's why I'm here.
"Only I want to rescue Clare, not die trying."
"Now, we're professional fucking soldiers."
We got a job to do...
You're not a fucking soldier.
"You're a scumbag arms dealer, selling mass murder."
"So, yes, you should fucking hate yourself."
"That's why Clare hates you too, right?"
"But that's your shit to work out, not mine."
I don't give a fuck if she forgives you or not.
I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
And that's to get that information on Latif.
No...
Which I'm starting to think is just some bullshit... story you're selling...
I'll keep my part of the deal.
"Really, Crawford?"
Good.
What can you tell me about the prison?
I know about the prison.
We need all the information we can get.
I have to reach my crew.
Don't you think there are people in there
I'd like to get out?
Any sane person would tell youit's impossible.
Spoken like a coward.
"I've heard about you, old man."
You're the coward!
Enough.
What are you doing with this lunatic?
Has he been telling you stories of his brave deeds?
They're just fantasies.
Taking him along on this rescue mission of yours is suicide.
He's already saved me from the Mokra once.
And he saved you from those soldiers today.
"All right, stay with him."
"Go off to the prison, get yourself killed."
I don't have to get killed if you'll tell me what you know.
There are access tunnels on the north side.
"They'll get you in a little closer, but they're guarded."
Then I'll need weapons.
They're not free.
I don't have anything to trade.
Thas worth some weapons.
I can't.
"Yes, you can... if ill help to bring her back to us."
Thank you.
I can have someone meet you on the street in three hours to make the trade.
He'll be wearing a blue vest.

You wanted to hang yourself and be a burden on my conscience
"It won't work, Ermakov."
No!
But I can do much better!
"I kill human beings, sending them back to where they came from or I take their sight of the sun by blinding them."
I decide who lives and who dies  the city that I will build!
I will create an immortal Rome!
Not even the mighty Olympus will not be able to prevent the birth of this city!
Oh mighty Cesar.
"Now I know, that you are mad."
Mad?
Why?
Because I take what I want without asking?
Because I have everyone executed who hates or betrays me?
I simply wipe away the worms which are attracted by the fetidness of their souls and which they try to hide under their tunicas.
"No Petreius, I'm not mad."
I am free!
I am the only free man in the world!
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
Maybe.
It's a funny thing to sell your soul for... ..a new beamer.
Yeah.
Cars have never really done it for me.
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
"One you gave the full VIP treatment to, I'm told."
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could have hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Poor man had been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
We'd best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
With fishing rods.
Little ones.
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
What will this sister of mine do with rice?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast.
- Ou!
"- Oh, help me!"
Help me!
"lam robbed, sir, and beaten."
"Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee."
"Oh, good sir, tenderly."
- Oh!
- How now!
Can'st stand?
Dost lack any money?
I have a little money for thee.
"No, good sweet sir, offer me no money, I pray you"
- That kills my heart.
- Then fare thee well.
I must go and buy spices for our sheep-shearing.

I think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best.
"Yeah, let's go."
"[Man] In John 10:10, Jesus tells us..."
"""I came so that everyone would have life and have it in its fullest."""
"So, since God planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now... why are so many of us... hurting and angry inside?"
It's because we refuse to believe in God's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only... so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
The Lord sacrificed His only Son for us... paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment.
"It sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
[Chattering]
Oh.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
She's a blessing to us too.
- Paige says you work in travel.
- Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
- Mmm.
"- Yeah, we..."
"Yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips... see all the good her generous donations are doing.
"Besides, I need you."
You're the one who's going to tell me where Doug is.
Oh.
Here.
Your car is in the campground parking lot.
What are we gonna do to resolve our problem?
"Well, I think our problems are a little different, but, yes, let's resolve them."
"You know, you and I have a very special connection."
- I'm not even sure who I'm talking to.
"- Oh, we met... in a manner of speaking."
"Istanbul, about six years ago."
July.
Seven years ago.
You took out those two diplomats.
Yes.
You know how close you came to catching me?
That was impressive.
"And ever since then, I've kept tabs on you."
You might say I've become a fan.
"I heard you got burned, and I got this gig in Miami, so... the stars just kind of lined up."
I like the new look.
And your bruise- it healed.
Yeah.
"Well, that was temporary."
I've been studying up on you.
"It's not easy with someone as secretive as you are, but, uh... of course, things got a lot easier when you got burned."
- Not classified material anymore.
- Lucky you.
I learned something about your early years.
Your daddy was mean.
Mmm.
"So I figured an abusive husband and a troubled but gifted son- well, that would be motivating."
"Well, let's go eat and then you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
How's the cat?
"What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one out of them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
You remember that?
It's clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
Because when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice cosy cell.
And you won't be with me.
I'm still here.
"What do you do for them, Calum?"
"You know, pretty much what I've always done."
"Multitasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"Morning, flatmate."
I don't know.
I could teach you your abc's.
In that case I might be a willing pupil.
Are you one of those rich refugees coming here looking for more money?
And sympathy.
"Well, I 'm not in the sympathy market yet but I guess we're both in the money market."
What're you gonna do in America?
"Oh, maybe I'll steal a little."
What do you do?
"I float, I drift."
I look...
"That's the man, officer."
What's the trouble?
You were on the ship that just came in?
"I'm awfully sorry about this, but my wallet was taken out of my pocket while I was getting my baggage."
Would you care to search me?
With your permission.
That's not my wallet.
Clementi Sabourin.
Is that your name?
Yes.
Is that what people do to each other in America?
Everybody frisking everybody else?
I'm awfully sorry.
"Tell me, uh... did you have very much money in that wallet?"
"I had about five hundred in currency, a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars..."
Of course I can have that stopped at the bank.
But there was a very important document.
"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't find it."
And so am I.
"This man does not have your wallet, sir."
We'll have to go back to the pier.
Um... those are bluebells.
They're for my sister's bouquet.

Those are... those are lilies of the valley.
They're for sweetness.

"I missed you so much,my angel."
My heart... is so... full right now.
"So was he crying with... with sound, or just physical tears?"
A little sound.
Did he at least throw himself into traffic after?
No.
"After,we talked about the intense feelings he has for me and why he has them."
"Which should be fun,right?"
I don't know why I spend so much time on my abs when nothing turns women on more than indifference.

All it manages to do is scare people.

Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches""."
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"""
"in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break.
She's drunk.
"As soon as something happens, you automatically make them out to be saints."
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup.
They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
"The woman is no angel, believe me."
They talked about their rotten kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts.
But that their kids still didn't pay any attention.
"When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy."
I don't know if I could live like that!
"God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?"
Karen...
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
"Because he wanted to get away from her, that's why."
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail?
Nigger stickup men.
Know why they get caught?
"Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen."
"Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie."
Come here.
"We visited so many pool halls that day and night, I couldn't begin to remember them all."
Barbara's 24 hours were about up... that is...
until your figured our pool bets.
"According to my calculations, you owe me through dinnertime, which is 6:00 p.m. in Bayonne."
Right.
My paranoia was in full bloom.
"Every time we came out of one of those pool halls, the blue sedan was cruising by."
"Even after we switched from the bus to the car, his tailing didn't improve."
It was almost like he wanted to be spotted.
Barbara?
Hmm?
Are you a girl who gets nervous in a car?
Never.
Wah!
"Barbara,"
I'm going to the bathroom.
"In two minutes, you go to the bathroom."
But I don't have to go to the bathroom.
"Please, go to the bathroom."
But I...
I don't have to go to the bathroom.
Please.
Okay.
But I don't have to.
"When somebody drives a car that tries too hard to be average... and sports a haircut with white sidewalls, government."
But why would the government care about Barbara's missing fiancé?
That's funny.
Higgins usually has the dogs greet me.
"Yeah, me too."
"Except today he was in a really, really good mood."
Kept laughing and saying something about busing.
"Why don't you make yourself at home, T.C.?"
"Would you just name it, for God's sakes?"
What is it?
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.
What about your daughter?
No.
Why?
Have you ever heard of exorcism?
"Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit."
"It's been pretty much discarded these days except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment."
"But it, uh, has worked, in fact although not for the reasons they think, of course."
It's purely force of suggestion.
"The, uh-"
- The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it so in that same way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor.
Is that it?
Karl?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
-What?
-A man to see you.
- What man?
"Might your daughter remember, perhaps if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night?"
"It has, like, Compressed some minerals."
"Gold likes to travel,"
But gold gets stuck with Other heavies pretty easily.
So we're thinking All we have to do.
Is jack up one of these Boulders.
And that might give us a clue On where the gold deposits are.
"So we got to boulder here,"
But I got to get some straps Around the boulder.
Zeke will try To float the massive stone.
Using straps and an air bag.
I don't do a lot of Boulder floating so
I don't know How this is gonna go down.
"All right, Just don't be under the boulder."
When you lift it.
But hoisting A 200-pound rock 35 feet down.
In the bering sea Is easier said than done.
Is that Enough slack?
Yes.
I think I'm gonna try to lift On it and see what happens.
Whoa.
Off the coast Of remote sledge island...
I think I'm gonna try to Lift on it and see what Happens.
Zeke tenhoff Is trying to pull.
A 200-pound boulder from The depths of the bering sea.
Whoop.
Whoa.
I see it.
There it is.
Are you okay?
"Well, I just Lost a float bag."
Looks like you didn't Strap it on good enough.
"Um, well, I'm just gonna Look under this boulder."
The legend is beautiful.
That ship is also very amazing.
"I can go in there, right?"
But how come this ship is here like this?
Because it's bewitched.
"If you become bewitched to a beautiful place, you become like this."
Have you ever been bewitched?
"Of course, I have."
I think you know.
"♬ When I look at you, everything stops ♬"
♬ I'm not sure when it started ♬
"Now that I think about it, I still haven't heard your response."
Have you been well?
Are you still sexy in the surgery room?
I think you misunderstood.
I didn't come here to do the volunteer work with good intention.
A higher up dragged me down for a little bit.
The place he sent me to was here.
"And now, I don't do surgeries anymore."
Looks like I didn't have enough skills for surgeries.
I will go back soon.
I will have to go back to the place I was in after I go back.
I am very busy.
I see.
♬ My tear's confession ♬
♬ Your love which flutters in the wind ♬
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
Okay.
Here.
"When you come to a place like this, you eat like this."
You will have the memory of this taste forever.
Just then...
Seo Yoon Jae's spirit thought his body to be dead and selfishly rushed into my body.
Yoon Jae...is not the kind of person to selfishly take someone else's body.
Whatever.
"Without any choice, my spirit went into Seo Yoon Jae's body."
This all happened because Seo Yoon Jae went into the wrong body.
Yoon Jae is a person of discretion.
He's not someone to make mistakes about his place like that.
Whatever.
Whatever!
This one has to leave...
There will be some sort of a solution whether it be just another switch-a-roo.
Yoon Jae...
How did this happen?
Why did you go to a place like that?
What?
A place like that?
I don't like..places like this either!
"Yoon Jae doesn't drink carbonated drinks, so can you drink something else?"
What?
"This isn't your body, but Yoon Jae's body."
"Until things go back to normal, I hope that you treat it preciously."
Preciously?
How?
"Just like Yoon Jae's always done, when you're thirsty, drink water instead of carbonated beverages."
Also the weather is chilly and this is thin.
Don't you have anything thicker and warmer?
You weren't even examined thoroughly earlier...
Oh my...
"Oh my, you're scraped here."
What do we do?
Wait a second.
"When Lotus arrives,"
I'll ask Yan to let her sit on this chair.
Then Yan will get the tea by leaps and bounds.
Isn't it great?
That's great!
Am I smart?
"Master, how to kiss her?"
Take a seat.
"When she is all wet, what's next?"
She will be very ugly and she will scream!
"No, no!"
She will get changed!
"Master, how can she get changed in public?"
Look!
This door will lock up automatically when it's closed.
"At the same time, water will flush out from this hole."
"According to human beings' instinct, Lotus will..."
Stuff it with her finger.
"At the same time, another water-column comes from that side."
She will stuff with another finger.
But she can't imagine that... another water-column aims... at her face!
"Master, do you mean it?"
Lotus is so poor then.
She can't seek for any help!
She must be scared and doesn't know what to do.
"In order to stop the water, everyone knows she will... stuff the hole with her tongue."
"That's right, you stand in front of the changing room."
"When it's the right time, remove the hose, move forward and kiss."
So I can kiss her.
Smug calcultation!
"When you hear the bell ringing, go ahead and kiss her."
What's the use of kissing her?
- I'm not a dog.
- Stay.
- What happened to you?
"- Oh, uh, I blame you."
I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks.
All the fun we've been having together.
"Heh, well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo,"
I'd love to know what's going on here.
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
Department of Public Safety is trying to figure out what happened.
- Where's Chin and Kono?
- Inside getting background.
- That your sister in the car?
"- Yeah, I just came from the airport."
"If she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her."
"- Can we just focus, please?"
- Yeah.
Why do you have aneurism-face?
- I don't have aneurism-face.
- She gave you aneurism-face?
How many times can you ask me?
You gotta seek first to understand then to be understood.
That's one of seven principles of successful people.
"I will literally pay you cash to stop talking, okay?"
"Excuse me, officer?"
"My pickup is around the corner, there's a woman in it."
"It's my sister, I'm putting her in your custody, okay?"
"Get her some food, take her back to my office."
"Don't take your eyes off her till I get there, you got it?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Thank you.
You happy?
"Neil, tonight, Victor..."
I'm sorry.
It's not over yet.
I'm exhausted.
"Oh, thank God."
"Me, too."
"Hey, we never stopped at the cash machine."
That's right.
I still owe you a lot of money.
"Well, maybe you'll find some other way to pay me."
I'll see what I can come up with.
Whew.
"I like these parties, but they are a lot of work."
May I help you?
Hi.
I'm sorry to show up like this.
"- You're Adriana, right?"
- Yes.
"I'm Anika Truman, Grace Truman's daughter."
"Yes, of course."
I thought you looked familiar.
"I know she did some work for you a while ago, and she showed me the drawings of your house, and I'm just passing through town, uh..."
Of course.
Would you like to come inside?
Maybe you'd like a cup of tea.
- I'd love some tea.
- All right.
"I, Asseylum Vers Allusia, will take Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard as my husband, and proclaim that I shall create a new kingdom here in Earthspace."
"At this time, in spite of the best efforts of you daring and resolute knights, this war is giving every indication that it will become protracted."
"With matters having come to this, what should our course of action be?"
Is this a time for Orbital Knights to squabble among themselves?
What does she think of herself?
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!
What the fuck do you think you are doing!
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!
I don't know what kind of tuitions you have been giving.
But learn this from me.
Take out your sim card!
Stay away from them they are rich and connected!
They will get you busted so bad you won't know what hit you!
Give me the sim card I will throw it away.
If you throw my sim card then how will my sisters call me?
Give them my number!
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?
Use my card and give them this number.
I am not going to let her get away with this!
I will cut her to pieces!
Don't talk shit.
We are out of booze as well!
Come...
Come on...
This godforsaken town is a real shit hole!
You place your trust in people thinking they are your friends.
But the moment you turn around they ram it right up your ass.
I'll go give this number to my sisters.
"Ok, but now don't go stressing them out as well."
"Hello, Sonu!"
Are you alright?
Who's number is this?
"It's a friend's number, save it on your phone."
You're gonna be vice president.
- You'll talk about legitimate issues of concern.
- Right.
Where is the senator's monitor?
There is no monitor for her.
She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.
That is a piece of shit.
"We talked about this, Ray."
"If Peter's gonna be able to see her, she has to be able to see him."
- He's got a sensory advantage over her.
- You wanna pull her?
I'm not talking about pulling her.
I'm just saying it's bullshit.
She was just great in the hearings today.
Cool and collected.
- Steve Poullet.
- Hi.
Should I hear anything?
"Oh, I got it."
"Okay, great."
"Oh, it's that one."
"Yeah, I know."
Can't hear...
"Yeah, right, got it."
"Okay, I've got the intro now."
"Thank you for having me, Peter."
"Sure, that'd be fine."
"Well, it has been a taxing experience... but if we're forced to take the voters out of the equation..."
I think that the vetting system by simple necessity must be arduous.
Mmm.
"I have to plead motherhood on that one, Pete... but I not only served on the Foreign Relations Committee..."
"I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill which readjusted the War Powers Act... to allow the executive to respond to state-sponsored terrorism... like that of Iraq, Libya, North Korea, for instance."
"Whatever, dude."
Nice.
"So, I went to the big meeting."
In two months the town will vote whether or not to close us down.
"Now, that will give people time to think."
"- What if they vote, ""Yes?"""
- I don't know.
"Look, what's with you guys?"
Don't you remember who we are?
Sonny Newman founded this home before there ever was a Charlestown.
His dog Dexter saved the entire city from the great flood of 1938 with one proud woof.
"The amazing Hanson brothers, whose ferocious might and legendary skill won the Federal Cup for this town in 1977."
They lived in this very house when they were boys just like us.
"Gentlemen, we are the Hanson brothers."
We are the children of the great Sonny Newman.
"We are the princes of Charlestown, and we will never be forgotten!"
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Double dessert for everybody!
- Yes!
Except for you!
"Time was, we never had a free skate on a Saturday."
Everybody'd be playing hockey.
I'm talking from toddlers to old guys like me.
"Good or bad, it didn't matter."
People loved it.
When the Chiefs won the title in '77...
I won a couple of banners myself playing junior in the '80s.
- You know what they used to call me?
- What's that?
- Fireball Rick.
- Are you serious?
Maybe the phone call hadn't worked.
But it had.
All I had to do was wait.
He was right on schedule.
"I was thinking, ""Go ahead."
"Beat it to your big beach home. """
This is the same gag you pulled on me.
It's even the same corpse.
Only thing missing is a sledgehammer highball and a pair of snake-eyes dice.
There was one joker.
What if he'd left a goon to watch his office?
"Here I was again, back to the scene of the TNT highball with the pretty girl camouflaging the safe."
Martinelli left in a hurry.
He hadn't turned the radio off.
"Not that I don't like music, but I work better in silence."
"I'm crazy about you, sweetheart, but move over."
"She moved over, Father."
The safe was wide open.
Martinelli really had hauled freight in a hurry.
"After my trouble to get Martinelli out, this would be dandy."
"I kept thinking, ""lt had to be here somewhere. """
"Up to now, everything had gone like grief."
He had the letter.
He'd been working on it.
But he hadn't gotten very far with his homework.
He was doing research on that letter but good.
The Leising Book of Codes.
Here was the real merchandise.
I recognized Johnny's writing.
Martinelli!
Martinelli!
"Then, suddenly, I got a whiff of jasmine."
You're not on the run.
Licence is in order.
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't wanna live here.
Too many ghosts.
Door.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCO detective also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago... while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
"Yeah, the kids found the bodies."
I saw something about that on the news.
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of her bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
After that he wrapped this tape around her face.
Suffocated her.
Must have taken a while.
The man who organised it is called Jacob Gould.
A real high flyer.
But I think he had help from the inside.
From who?
Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
"So you're part of this Operation Merlin thing as well, are you?"
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"Who do you work for, then?"
"Oh, now, there's a question."
- As for you...
Rebecca.
Her name was Rebecca.
- Is that all you know about her?
"- Well, not too much more, I guess."
- Does that make you feel good?
"- No, it doesn't."
"Eric, every once in a while, let your brain in on what the rest of you is doing."
Are you two both clear on this?
"But if I can't use Eric's method, then how do I get a girl to say hi?"
- Cory...
- Yeah?
What did you know about girls before your brother's excellent advice?
- I didn't know anything.
- Why don't you just go with that?
"Um, ready to go?"
"Look, are you feeling a little funny about this?"
"You mean, about going out on a date?"
"Yeah, because we don't even know each other."
A little funny.
"So do you wanna, like, not go out on a date?"
"- Yeah, it doesn't feel right."
- I understand.
But we should still get to know each other.
"Oh, that would be nice."
"Yeah, because then, in case we ever did want to go out, well, we'd know each other."
"So, um, how do you want to get to know each other?"
"Well, we could go somewhere and talk..."
if you don't have something else to do.
"Well, I did, but, um..."
now I'm suddenly free.
Great.
-Yeah?
-Progress report.
Excuse me?
Progress report?
"No, ""Hello, how are you?"""
"Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming me up."
What?
"I love capitalism as much as the next guy, but this is off the charts."
"Your commerce is so far up my ass, I can't sit up."
"Listen, the Age of Aquarius never happened, okay?"
-Get real.
This is commerce.
-I want to tell you something for your soul.
Pushing for Christmas and radio play will only amount to shit and wrapping paper.
"I don't know what happened, Jane."
We really used to be on the same page.
"I don't know what happened either, Claudia."
I guess you started exercising.
Gotta go.
Bitch.
Cunt.
Can we just say how lovely Jane looks today?
Can we just have a moment of appreciation for our sweet lovely Jane?
Jane rocks.
Get the fuck out of my chair.
I had a math teacher in high school who was sort of my mentor.
"You know, I was one of those science geeks and my mother wasn't really around."
"So he took me under his wing, and he convinced me that I should be a doctor."
Which seemed like the right idea at the time.
"You know, I guess I needed to prove myself."
To who?
Who were you trying to prove yourself to?
He was crying.
"Very, very upset."
He wanted to go home.
To his mommy.
And I wanted to send him home.
But I knew I couldn't.
Then I told him I would take him.
"I put him in my car, started driving."
He kind of cheered up.
But of course I wasn't taking him home.
I was taking him... somewhere else.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
"Who else is lying about that day, Mark?"
Are you?
Are your friends?
Jesse was crying when I found him.
"Who made him cry, huh?"
The DNA tie-in with the missing kid is potentially huge.
For now this cannot get out.
We dig away until we know exactly what we are dealing with.
Don't want journalists banging on my door.
Danny.
The murder victim is yet to be ID-ed.
But we are tracing her mobile as it's possible the killer might have taken it with him.
Next.
"Now given the reputation of the murder location and the manner of her dress, we're working on the possibility that she was accepting payment for sex."
"So it could be a disgruntled client, partner of someone."
Or drug-related.
Every hooker I've encountered has been an addict.
We all know how many hookers Mickey's encountered.
"Yeah, it's very funny."
***
"Something with, uh, a lot of saturated fats in, please."
And yes to any questions about making it larger.
Alright?
Eating off the bonnet of your car.
Yeah.
"Cause you don't want the smell to get in the fabrics, do you?"
"Yeah, that's why I'm doing it."
Nothing to do with not wanting my family to know anything.
"Well, I can't take it back to the surgery cause Mary doesn't allow it."
"But you're the boss, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
So you allow Mary not to allow it.
It's policy.
Mary is very good with policy.
"We all dream of a world where you can eat burgers at work, and wear aftershave on days when it isn't your birthday."
"But work's never going to be like that, is it?"
"Yes, very used to dealing with large purchasing budgets."
And what do you think you can bring to the surgery personally?
If anything at all.
"Well I've had a look around, and it works."
It's fine.
Yes?
But no offense...
What do you mean?
"I mean first off the waiting room,"
I mean would it kill us to get a couple of plasmas in there?
I hardly think a doctor's waiting room...
"I'm sorry, I'm talking to the doctor."
No.
"No, it wouldn't kill us."
Where is she?
This did not happen on my watch.
"When she clocked in I was still in my pj's, jamming to Luther Vandross."
"Wow, this is a beautiful setup."
They're running themselves?
"No, Mrs. R."
They're being run remotely.
Amanda Baylor.
Are you there?
ZIVA:
"Amanda Baylor, 28, unmarried, freelance encryption specialist, graduated from MIT with a degree in applied mathematics."
What else?
"That's pretty much it, boss."
"With the exception of a few personnel files from the Iron Crypt, it's like she doesn't exist."
"Well, she existed enough to have stolen that file from AUTEC and set up a pretty good alibi."
How often was she logged in at work when she wasn't actually there?
Can we link her to Phillip Wickes?
We have not been able to tie Baylor to anyone at Wickes Steel.
Not even the board stooges.
Wickes is still only talking to them and only about pushing paper.
What about a line from Amanda Baylor to our dead guy?
ZIVA:
"Baylor does not have a history with firearms, but it is still possible"
(phone rings) that she shot Ridgeway.
"Yeah, Abbs."
Tell her you're on your way.
I'm on my way.
"There, there it is."
I don't see it.
She's right.
There was a bounce.
Damn it.
Just switching things up a little bit.
"You know, it's like having breakfast for dinner."
Mmm!
"Now, about this van, I mean, it really is a super-cool idea for the future."
"- I mean, it's like the perfect plan."
- I haven't told you the plan.
"Great, cause I do not understand it."
"I think I've found an untapped market that, if properly assessed, may be poised... to explode."
"Okay, I get it."
"It's like you have a huge pile of dynamite, and you just lit the fuse."
I can see it right now--
I still haven't told you the idea.
"Great, 'cause I still don't understand it."
I'm gonna show you.
"And, mom, trust me, this isn't some, like, get-rich-quick plan."
"Oh, like your dad's idea for the reverse microwave, where it makes the food cold?"
Reverse microwave's a good idea in a world where a freezer doesn't exist.
Mom...
"[ Sighs ] you believe in me, right?"
Of course.
[ Both laugh ]
You think you maybe want to put on some pants today?
Pants are for closers.
I'm a bum.
What are you doing?
I always do that.
It turns me on.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What is it?
I was thinking about how you lost your mayor's job.
Stupid city council impeached me.
Bad news.
There's more red tape around that thing than I have ever seen.
"The good news is, I have a talent for badgering people until they give me what I need."
Hard to believe.
Wickes is lying low for a reason.
I think he eliminated the only remaining connection between his company and AUTEC.
I think he saw us snooping around.
I think he sent us straight to Ridgeway's door.
"I mean, who would suspect him?"
You.
(phone chimes)
Your son?
"You're not the only one who can spot a tell, Doc."
Parker's a funny kid.
He's trying to wrangle fast food out of my sister.
(laughs) No.
You got pictures?
Your surveillance pictures weren't good enough?
"By the way, bad of me."
"Well, that's not the kind of Kodak moment I was thinking."
(laughs)
He was just little when he gave it to me.
He used to love boats almost as much as you do.
"He said it was the two of us, and that we were on this boat, sailing away, happy."
He wanted to take you away.
Who's playing doctor now?
(phone ringing)
"Yeah, McGee."
"Boss, I finally got the IP for the computer used to hack into AUTEC."
Belongs to a government consultant named Amanda Baylor.
So that's our computer genius?
An encryption specialist.
"Oh, doctor!"
Doctor.
Good to see you.
How is our Gyung Joon?
Ah yes...
I see...
That he hasn't regained his consciousness yet.
"They say his body is all fine, so why isn't he waking up?"
"You don't think he's going to stay in that state like that, right?"
They say there's nothing wrong...
So I'm sure he'll wake up.
They say that people can stay in a state like that for several years.
Then what do we do about him?
Do we have to keep on taking care of him?
Doctor...
"That won't happen, right?"
"If by any chance, that happens, what are you going to do?"
Doctor.
We don't have the relationship where we have to take responsibility for him.
We're just relatives who have been left in charge for the time being.
The hospital shouldn't be asking us what should be done with him in the future.
-Honey!
-What?
Doctor...
"Then, goodbye."
"Ugh, this boy..."
Isn't there somewhere in America where we can send him off to just in case?
Who would take care of him?
"Since he grew up there, there has to be someone he was close to!"
It's because there was no such person that he came to Korea!
What should we do with his belongings?
-Gyung Joon...
I am an Allied agent and I need your help.
- Is Major George Stirling here?
- That's me.
It's an honor to meet you.
"I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout."
The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.
I'm not risking these men's lives for anything less than a solid plan.
"If we're gonna turn things around, we need to do something now."
You can't just wait here to die.
- We're digging a tunnel.
- Danny.
You can trust me.
"I broke in for you, didn't I?"
- We're clearing a foot a day.
- When do you expect to finish?
"Three months, give or take."
Then we're all getting out.
- We don't have that much time.
- Time 'til what?
I can't say.
"But we have weeks, not months."
It's an important operation.
It could make the difference.
We need your most experienced men.
"Your strongest, to help train civilian recruits."
So what's your plan?
Next time on work detail
I'll give a signal.
My team will provide covering fire while we break for the woods.
Ahh!
They said you told them nothing at the gate.
"You are a mystery, and I am a curious person."
"If I go there, I got to shop around."
I'm too lazy to choose.
"You can go out, just to hang out."
It's fun.
"What do you mean, ""go out just to hang out?"""
Go out just to hang out you know?
I don't get it.
What are you saying?
Sometimes I think you are messing with me.
I'm not messing with you.
Why would I do that?
What do you find entertaining?
Hmm...
Thinking of new projects.
Hey that is work.
No.
Work is when someone hires us to do something.
This is thinking of stuff to do on our own.
Then how about sports?
Sports?
I like to play badminton but I have no one to play with.
You don't meet up with your friends at all?
I meet them sometimes at funerals and weddings.
"But I can't really invite anyone out, since my schedule always changes."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Dang!
This has anything to do with my rash?
Seriously.
"Some people think there is no link, but a patient's lifestyle has an effect on their disease."
"And if I don't, what is your medical opinion on having one or not?"
It actually depends on the person.
"Some people have one and it's good, but for some, it's bad."
- Go.
- Ain't you joining?
I joined last month.
"- Hey, I wanna ask a question."
- Yeah?
"If we joined up, don't we get a uniform or something?"
"Man, the Black Legion's got the doggonest uniform you ever laid eyes on."
"One that will throw fear into the hearts of all them rotten, ungrateful foreigners."
One bar ain't enough.
It goes to prove it.
The man was hungry and there should be two bars a day because--
He eats as much as we all do.
"Say, are you gonna let him bust in on me like that?"
"What do you mean, talking to the judge like that, you mug?"
"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but let me explain something."
There should be two bars a day.
One in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Do I have to put up with that little slug interrupting all the time?
You two guys better get along together.
I'll kick you both out of court.
"Okay, the state rests."
What do you do?
"Oh, we rest too."
Then the jury will retire and consider a verdict.
"- Hey, Butch."
"- Yes, sir?"
Come here.
- When did you see Jim last?
"- Oh, about an hour ago in the dormitory."
Yeah.
I'll look him up and have a talk with him.
Didn't I tell you everything would be all right?
"I use to told you that this Laxmi Narayan, will make her mother's dream come true."
I proud of you.
How many bullets you have shoot on throat.
None.
You much have cut him.
Kill by pushing the throat?
How cheap your mentality is Bhai... just like egg of lizard.
"Do not take life, give life to become Bhai(brother)"
You should learn some.
I am not cheep Bhai like you.
Who do business in diamonds and take others life.
I thought you have reputation.
But now i know that you have no reputation.
Did you kill her or not?
No.
Because i want to become Godfather.
"Godfather, even Chota Khujli can become father too."
But one can become God when he give life.
And today i saved her life here's your diamonds.
From today we have separate ways.
"Because i wont work for cheep Bhai like you, who sopil the name of underworld, for a underwear."
Check you diamonds and Chota Khujli marry your daughter with some Aslam Bhoda etc.
Now i don't have any interest in her.
What is this?
Diamond.
Is this diamond?
"Yeah see its written here too, pure diamond."
See this.
Where would i wear this diamond?
"Its you own choice, why you are asking me?"
"Check it carefully, Laxmi Narayan don't left any work undone."
What!
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"- Excuse me, the DEA?"
- Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
I understand that.
What does that have to do with the DEA?
They're after some mystery man some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up."
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Wait, wait."
"Look, I just..."
I think...
I just think that we should review our options.
Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
You got a grand total of two.
Option A:
Brandon takes the deal.
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
"Look, look."
What about reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge?"
What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about, ""If I talk, they'll kill me."""
Right.
You pointed the finger at Cole.
You led everyone up the garden path.
"Meanwhile, we've got two coppers murdered."
I'm not saying another word without a solicitor.
"Fine, we'll continue this conversation at AC-12 under caution, a date to be appointed by us."
Thank you.
Sir.
You have to shut this down.
I will not let anyone put you on the spot about Cole.
We both know why.
Shut this down now.
You know the secrets I can spill.
"Why don't you come into AC-12 with your solicitor, you tell us you heard the Caddy rumour about Cole off some old lag, dead or lost his marbles, and you leave me to do the rest?"
And?
There's always an and.
And... you turn over all the stuff you've got on me.
End of.
End of?
"The incriminating item I've got on you, that's my only insurance."
You need me to shut this down.
I'm small fry.
You're the big fish.
So what'll happen when they find out about all that evidence you've been sitting on?
Hm?
The contacts in that phone.
The call history.
"All in my past, mind."
"Now, that isn't something anyone could shut down."
"Now, you're what?"
Six months off retiring?
Four and a half.
"Once inside, I could direct the flow of electrons through the wires hidden in the walls."
I was able to find my way to Amanda's room.
"Finally, I got my message through."
"And finally, we would have our chance to talk."
Phase Three.
MEET ME AT THE RACK ALARM CODE 12154
You owe me... big.
"Trager, you really embraced your inner Hallmark card."
You've gone soft.
I know.
You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
All this for puppy love?
"I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?"
"I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set Kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced."
"God, that felt good."
Did you see where I put the napkins?
Is there a garlic convention in here?
Too much?
Never.
What's the occasion?
Take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
Um...
I'm incredibly hungry.
How about all of the above?
Stephen.
Hmm?
You mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
After five years it can be everywhere.
"Why did they wait so long until they sent us, anyway?"
Procrastination is like masturbation:
At first it feels good  but in the end you just catch yourself.
"I've got all the data out, Commander!"
"I'm a backup person, nasty killer machine!"
"I do not need no hand, to kill a Noid."
Because you've never seen one of those things take the man's arm.
You said it!
"If so my kill rate goes high, I like that."
I know the reports on AI systems.
The majority of patients are 10 years after implantation.
"So you have no problem, you're wrong."
"Sorry for all the shit about the death of your wife, sir."
"Between us, this mission is not about Noids."
Is personal.
We are his devilish dogs...
And we come back healthy!
"Hey Bishop, what are you doing?"
Shaving your legs?
If we do not have more energy and your blaster has become shiny black cock
What do you do then?
Then I put the bastard in the ass!
"I caught something warm, behind the snow."
"Okay, Kix."
- Warm the gun!
- Your best idea so far!
Kix waits for my signal.
"- You're the boss, Commander!"
- Go to your last team!
I thought this noid could fly.
"Hatta, do not continue."
"And then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud."
He'll draw every light from every goon tower.
It's our only chance to cut through.
"What do you say, barracks chief?"
"He's right, Hoffy."
It's either Price or Dunbar.
"He killed Johnson and Manfredi, didn't he?"
It's all yours.
"What's the matter, Price?"
"You said you were gonna save Dunbar, didn't you?"
So now you're getting your chance.
"So long, Cookie."
"You can have the department store, what's left of it."
"So long, Sefton."
"You're not disposing of those Russian broads, are you?"
Tell you what to do.
Get yourself 100 cigarettes for the Kraut guards.
Then get yourself another face.
- You could use a new one too.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Let's synchronize the watches.
It's 11:42 sharp.
Check.
Just one more word.
If I ever run into any of you bums on a street corner just let's pretend we never met before.
Shut off the moaning or you'll have the machine guns on us.
"Shut it off, lieutenant."
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly one minute and 20 seconds.
- Sefton.
"-What'd you expect, a St. Bernard dog?"
- Not you.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCA detective, also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
The kids found the bodies - I saw it on the news.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad.
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
"After that, he wrapped this tape around her face."
Suffocated her.
Must've taken a while.
"The man that organised it is called Jacob Gould, a real high-flyer."
But I think he had help from the inside.
- From who?
- Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
So you're part of this Operation Merlin as well?
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"- Who do you work for, then?"
"- Oh, now there's a question."
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post-traumatic stress.
- Yeah.
Unofficially?
- I don't think that's any of your concern.
- My job's to disorganise crime.
- Illegally.
"- I prefer to use the world ""irregular""."
"- Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
I've got to find some way to make money.
Why doesn't he just retire and let me run the business?
There's not a chance of that.
The business is his whole life and he's still in his prime.
Except for his absent-mindedness about appointments.
"You know,"
I think you've got something.
What do you mean?
The old boy is losing his grip.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
"When you can't remember business matters, it's time to retire."
John's got a memory like a file cabinet.
He never forgot anything in his life.
"Ellen thinks he forgot about my appointment, doesn't she?"
You know very well you never had an appointment.
I know it.
But does John?
Don't you get it?
He prides himself on his memory.
"If we can convince him that he is getting forgetful, then we'll be able to..."
"Oh, no!"
He'd be a nervous wreck in no time.
"Oh, what a horrible thought."
It was only an idea.
I think it's a wonderful horrible idea.
Something I can do?
Something you should've done three weeks ago.
Why haven't the contracts been sent to the Craddock people?
Just waiting for you to sign them.
What are you talking about?
I signed them a month ago.
"I'm sorry, John."
"Yeah, come on we got to go."
The last night bus is in ten minutes.
Don't touch me!
"Fine, sleep it off."
I'll see you later.
Sweet venom.
Blood Ties S02E04 Bugged
The reaper's influence has fallen over my sanctum.
"Sorry, the reaper?"
"Oh, the grim...reaper."
A dead body was found outside Lexia's club.
"My sweet angel, you read my mind."
Death's hand touches us all but this boy's passing might doom the Underground.
And the Underground is the name of your bar?
"The Underground's not a bar, it's more of a..."
Booze can for blood sucking wannabees?
"A sanctuary for children of the night, where they can congregate."
At nine dollars a drink.
I thought you said she was open to those who choose to live alternative lifestyles.
She is.
You are.
Believe me.
"Okay, here's the part I don't understand."
"If he died in the alley, what exactly do you want me to investigate?"
I have enough problems with the city already.
I don't need them trying to blame Dante's death on me.
Is there any reason to believe your establishment might be connected to his death?
My customers are like my children.
"I nurture them, like Coreen...my favorite."
The most spiritual of the night breed.
Okay I'll take the case.
- My fee is...
It says Robert Quinn?
"Until there is signed consent from Robert Quinn, the adoption of Callie Jacob is denied."
Told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt.
Your bones are shattered in several places.
- He's gonna need surgery.
- He's a pianist.
Our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all.
- What are you doing up?
- Can't sleep.
You?
I remember when you used to crawl into bed with me when that happened.
"Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, spare you tonight."
Hm.
"Then you'd end up sprawled out sideways, your feet next to my head, kicking me in the face all night long."
"See, I remember it as you headbutting my feet, actually."
Really?
Then Mama would viciously attack your elbows with her ribs?
Really?
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Sounds terrible.
Eh... it was pretty nice.
Back when that was all it took to make you feel safe.
- How's it feel?
- About the same.
Still numb?
"What if I, um  can't ever play again  like I used to?"
"Honey, don't think like that."
"You can't think like that, ok?"
"You just have to keep trying, keep at it, you know?"
"Don't you ever give up on your dream, you hear me?"
- We don't have any oranges?
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
"No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world."
Ten thousand dollars.
"Ten thousand, cash to you."
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
"What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?"
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"Yeah. ""Morally outraged, "" he said."
Threatened to call the police.
"- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?"
- Like the Exxon Valdez.
"So, what do we do about it?"
"Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
"That, and the fact that she speaks English."
- You didn't have to do this.
"- But it's teatime, and I wanted to..."
"Oh, no."
"Beatrice, I told you to doily-line the plates."
You don't have to doily-line the plates.
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.
"- Rory, you're already here."
- You're out of breath.
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.
Your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us.
That certainly justifies a run.
"All right, everybody, sit."
"Pour the tea, Beatrice."
"Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on... pouring the tea for just a minute?"
Thank you very much.
"Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you."
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.
But I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.
We won't get upset.
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.
And you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.
She's been hanging around you far too much.
"Rory, we accept your terms."
Please proceed.
Thank you.
"First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know I'm here."
"She'd probably be mad if she knew that I was, but I feel this is important."
Do you have no pride?
"You're like a cheap whore who'll do whatever her man wants, you know that?"
What about the honeymoon?
Did the director say anything?
"Come on, cooperate with me."
That man was mine since I was sixteen.
That can't be.
Have you been here before?
Have you been here?
I just passed by it on the way to a company workshop.
I'm really a bastard.
"Ever since that day, I think about having you half the day, every day."
I think that's all that's occupying my thoughts.
"Sometimes I wonder, how can I be less of a bastard and still hold you in my arms?"
"I was always like, ""What should I do?"" ""Can I make a move first?"""
But I was afraid that I would be embarassed.
Aren't you taking too much meds?
Why are you taking meds so often?
It hurts.
Is something bothering you that I don't know about?
There's no such thing.
-Why does it hurt so often then?
- I don't know.
Maybe something's growing inside.
Don't even say that!
It just comes too often.
-Could it be really brain tumor?
-Stop saying that and go to a hospital.
It will stop.
"Sis, did you go out?"
I thought you said you weren't going out.
Even if you shed tears over her.
Because I... am already yours.
Could that have triggered it?
No...
It couldn't be.
I always looked up to you.
You had everything that I did not.
So I hated you.
"Still, do not worry, sister."
"From now on, I will be truly be your substitute and I will be Slaine's support!"
Why...?
What's up with that?
Does that mean she got ditched here?
"""The captain left me in charge because she trusts me."""
"That's what she said, but Cdr."
Mizusaki has got to be devastated.
Why did she pick Lt. Marito of all people as her traveling companion?
Companion?
"Escort, more like."
What's this about Lt. Marito?
"No, um..."
"It's just that he accompanied the captain to the conference, so I thought it might be serious."
Ah.
"With that Martian proclamation and all, the situation is definitely changing."
I can't believe that the princess is getting married...
That's what you're interested in?
"No, but look..."
Isn't it possible that her change of heart was because someone around her felt that way?
"Like, she was seduced by him or something?"
Sorry.
"But we're still not 100% sure that the Princess Asseylum who said that was the princess who spent time with us, right?"
I honestly can't say.
"What does Harry have to say this morning, my dear?"
"I said, what does Harry say this morning?"
"Oh, nothing much."
I'll wager my gout hurts him more than it does me.
Does he send any news I can hear?
"Oh, he just says that he walked through the East End recently."
"""I have never seen such deplorable housing conditions."
"Surely the city fathers should find the funds to..."""
"Well, then he just goes on to say about the housing conditions."
They must be pretty dreadful.
He's quite right.
They're disgraceful.
I was saying at the club before I left.
"Now, there's a problem Harry could get his teeth into."
He's just the man to...
"Here, here, my dear."
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested in housing conditions at the moment.
You mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment?
Nonsense.
"A woman must learn to read between the lines, my dear."
"Yes, I like the tone of that letter."
"And what's more, my dear, I think my gout is getting very much better."
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
- Are you here alone?
"Yes, yes."
I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.
"Not me, nor you either."
We ain't got time.
"Get dressed, we're going out."
what is that?
- A really good movie?
- that's a tabloid tv show.
Come on. seriously£¬guys. she can't keep getting away with this.
we all just have to band together and take her down.
Serena we just graduated. gossip girl high school
All these people backbiting and conniving--
Don't you think we should be moving on with our lives?
Well high school's over
But--but they're still my friends. you're still my friend.
Yeah.
What you--you don't think so?
No no i do but honestly...
School's finished
And our parents...
That--that doesn't really look great.
Next year we're gonna be in different cities.
And when you think about it
What's really keeping us together?
So that's it?
You--you get your diploma and you're just moving on?
Well congratulations dan.
Have--have a good life.
So... doughnuts?
No let's just go home.
- I want to--i want to get out of this suit. - all right.
The number of posts in the last six months about constance and st. jude's is more than double
Of the next mentioned school.
number one on our hit list
Would seem to indicate a personal connection.
And i refuse to believe the students at our school are
Any worse than those at horace mann or spence.
"- I am innocent of what I am accused of tonight, but there is something else to which I must confess."
"From a young age, this man was not only my trusted physician, but the object of my lust."
He was a friend of my father's and forbidden to me.
"But in my innermost desires,"
I burned for him.
He is here tonight.
"In fact, he is the very man who brought me here to Rosewood."
Torrington... come.
Let us finally admit what has remained silent for so long.
Please... let us be married in sin together.
Come play our little game tonight.
You will be rewarded later.
- This is not the trial!
- Now it is time for you to play your part.
I can't wait to do this to you when we're alone tonight.
I've dreamed of this evening since you were a young girl.
- Isabel.
"- Tonight, the judges shall be judged."
"Dr. Cairn, this blade looks quite real."
"Calm yourself, Doctor."
It's all part of the performance.
"- Tonight, you will all be on trial."
"Aconites, you call yourselves."
"Playing with people's lives while you pretend to drink monkshood, wolf's bane."
"Well, tonight you drank the real thing."
- Dr. Cairn?
Doctor...
Dr. Cairn?
Get me out of here.
"Dr. Cairn, get me out of here."
- Run.
You run far away from this place.
Tell me...
"- Do you understand british divorce courts, Mr. Collins?"
- Sorry.
"UK law, elementary requirements."
Not at all.
My situation is such that discretion in this case with this single young woman is both financially and publically essential.
"So you, you do know about Zack Starr?"
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
"Only what Krista told me over the pillow, so to speak."
How did you two meet?
Social function.
"I was at a gallery opening, she walked in, and, I noticed."
It happened like that.
Did it?
So can you tell me where she is now?
No.
I haven't seen her in a few days.
"And to be quite honest, she finds me,"
"I don't have a number or an address,"
- just a willingness to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.
I tell you what.
"If you meet me at this park,"
"I've got a meeting downtown, I'll... have some of my people dig her up for you."
"I'm sorry, poor choice of words, but I'm sure once I get them onto it."
I'll be able to tell you exactly where she's been found.
"Now if there's nothing else, I think we're done here."
"There is one more thing, Mr. Van Sciver."
Do you know what this symbol is?
Should I?
That wasn't my question.
What was it that you asked me?
"Well, sir, it was only what you said about being fixed up with an alibi."
"I mean, did he have a reason to?"
"Lieutenant, would you mind speaking clearly?"
Did who have a reason to do what?
"Make an alibi, sir, your friend."
"I mean, were you watching the ballgame at ten minutes to nine, sir, with him?"
"Oh, I see."
Well...
"Yes, I suppose I was."
"I don't have an exact memory about time, that's why I have Mark."
"And if he says I was, I was."
He's very responsible about time.
That's what makes him a superior gofer.
"You think she was murdered, don't you?"
"I beg your pardon, sir?"
You heard me.
"Yes, sir, I did."
I mean...
"Yes, I do think it was a premeditated killing, sir."
"I mean, I think the robbery was staged to cover-up the murder."
"How did you know, sir?"
Why else would you be here?
"It could be just a routine check, sir."
"No, Lieutenant."
"They don't send a police detective stumbling around asking silly, fake-innocent questions on a routine check."
I know that from my show.
"Well, silly, fake-innocent questions like what, sir?"
(CHUCKLES)
"Like, ""Mr. Daley wasrt at home last night."
"""He wasrt there this morning."
They told me at the office.
And you?
I trusted you.
I had to do what was best for my family.
- Don't you ever call me again.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Not sorry enough.
What are you reading?
Seeing with Serenity:
How to Cope With What Life Deals You.
I took a trip to the self-help section at the bookstore.
"So far, it's just pages and pages of vague platitudes."
"Mom, you've been avoiding my calls."
I didn't know what I wanted to say.
I wish I could turn back the clock and make a different decision.
- But I can't.
- I know.
You seem angrier at me than Kevin or Tommy.
Am I wrong?
Probably not.
You hold me to a different standard than anyone else.
That's not fair.
Yes.
"You're right, it's not fair."
I just always felt this connection with you.
You raise a boy and you don't expect them to tell you anything.
You're lucky if they acknowledge you on their way out the door.
But you always confided in me.
I felt like you trusted me to handle whatever came along.
I never had that relationship with my mother.
I always thought I had it with you.
"Mom, we do have that relationship."
The last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette!
"Okay, Officer, I think we..."
we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
Let me check with my supervisor.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
"I missed you at Dad's funeral, Mare."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
You know the last time I saw you was at Mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.
"'Cause I was thinking it could've been cool to have a picnic in between, or something, you know?"
- A picnic?
- Yeah.
A picnic.
"Something that, I don't know, normal families do?"
"How did you say you were injured, again?"
"Well, originally, uh... playing high school baseball, but, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time."
"Anything traumatic recently, with the knee?"
"Yeah, actually."
I got a new partner.
I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, no, this-this guy is like a physical injury, Doc."
"Ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car-- not joking-- onto the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
He drove a car onto a boat?
How about that carpenter?
He treats me well
"But he wants a son, and I want an id card"
"When he got a son, and I get my id card"
He won't force me to be with him
He might even give me some money then I can do whatever I want
What do you want to do anyway?
I want to go to Taiwan
Then what do you want to do in Hong Kong?
Me?
"I want to be rich I want to earn a lot of money, and enjoy myself"
Can't you be rich in Thailand?
If I could would I have come to Hong Kong?
Then are you rich yet?
Do you know how to become rich?
"I know Hung Fist, and have learnt Thai Boxing too lf l combine the 2 styles they are no match to me"
"Just wait and see, I will win"
Does it hurt?
Do you feel the pain?
"This is Ah Mut Sha, your opponent"
He's testing the power of his opponent
"Watch out for his elbow, he's quick"
"He's Chan Kam Kong, represented Hong Kong last time"
His punches are powerful
Have you seen his knee attacks?
Very lethal
Within one round
"One, two, three, four"
Again
Catch it
"Lousy Japanese stuff, hardly used it for over a day"
Save some money
"Ah, kid was breaking our hearts, telling us about his girlfriend dumping him."
"You know, saying how much he had to win in order to buy her an engagement ring."
"We kept saying that he should just forget about her, but, no, he just kept playing."
Until you stole all his money.
I thought about giving some of it back.
Yeah.
That's right.
"But then, that kid-- he just went nuts."
"Flipped the table over, and he just ran out."
- Where?
- How should I know?
"Hate to break Rule 22, boss, but his lawyer's here."
Then I'm done talking.
Oops.
Got the same story from the blackjack dealer.
"If what he says is even half true,"
Petty Officer Adams could have left that game and picked a fight with the first person that he saw.
Could be anyone.
Thoughts?
"Well, with no security cameras at the pizzeria,"
Ziva and McGee are checking neighboring stores.
"Ye, I know that."
"I asked you your thoughts, DiNozzo."
My thoughts?
"I thought you didn't like my process, my yabba yabba."
Doesn't mean I don't depend on it.
Oh.
"Well, in that case, the pizza guys are slimeballs."
Thin crust beats deep dish every time.
"And every suspect in this case has an answer for everything, but one of them's got to be lying."
- Yeah?
Which one?
ABBY:
Welcome to AUTEC and the surrounding areas of the Caribbean.
What is this?
The Bermuda Triangle.
And an ode to my inner mapper.
I'm marking the site of each and every amazing thing that happened here.
"Well, you can't just say that and not give us a little taste."
I wouldn't dream of it.
"Okay, so this bullet marks where the USS Cyclops vanished in the Triangle, and this bullet is the Bimini Wall."
It's a possible location for Atlantis.
"And this bullet, Gibbs, this is the Tongue of the Ocean."
"It's like an underwater Grand Canyon, and we think that AUTEC is running cables down more than 6,000 feet."
To what we don't know.
"Any of these bullets have a point, Abbs?"
The bullet that killed Ridgeway.
I traced that back to a company called Vita Foras.
Vita Foras.
It's Latin.
Rough translation:
"""Great Outdoors."""
I'd guess we're looking at hunting weapons?
You would guess right.
"More specifically, extremely rare hunting rifles, the kind that crazy hard-core collectors would trade."
Hard to track.
Exactly.
"Love your triangle, Abbs."
I...
I just have to ask.
You're in the business of proving things with science.
Why this need to chart the unexplainable?
"Wait, you're in my head, right?"
I'm just going to answer you in my thoughts.
- Yun-hwa!
What are you waiting for?
Come in and take a good look.
"But if you do not find the man you are looking for, there will be consequences for violating the privacy of a maiden."
"No, wait out there."
Are you satisfied?
What more do you want?
Leave this room.
How much more contempt must I tolerate?
It's bad enough that you've force yourself into a maiden's room.
Do you now wish to tear it apart?
Leave now.
I will not tolerate any more disrespect!
What are you doing here?
Lady Yun-hwa has a message for you.
For me?
You wish to go to the baron?
Do you know who you are up against?
The baron isn't your only opponent.
"Imperial Attendant Ju Tae-moon, Prime Minister Yoon Won-hyung, this could be a fight against the King who would shield them!"
One man has already lost his life.
I have no other choice.
This is the only way to save my friend's life.
They will not release him that easily no matter what you say.
"In fact, they will try to hurt you as well."
I can't back down.
You may be disqualified from the exam.
You may never get the chance to realize your cherished dream!
I know.
"Master, it's Kyun."
Enter!
Brothers...
- Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth,but it was never found."
All right.So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean war.
Something bad happened in Wonju...
schoolchildren killed by U.S.land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
********
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh,my God."
"On March 21,1963,Alcatraz officially closed."
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
"You're checking her for TBI,right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly,I barely bumped my head.Thanks."
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore,so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,Hastings and Sylvain their guns."
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean,maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
"-This is the spot, you say?"
-That's right!
This is your spot.
So what's the standard for finding the rock?
Standards?
The standards are a little...confusing.
"For example, if the standards for finding the rock is the size, then in that case, since Choong Sik is the biggest in this family, this would be Choong Sik."
Then your wife would be next...
Gil Da Ran...
And you.
Then...if the beauty is the standard for finding the rock...
Then...since this is the prettiest...
your wife.
"Then next would be Choong Sik, Gil Da Ran..."
And you.
See?
The standards for finding one is confusing.
Father-in-law...
So...
"With me being the ugliest and the smallest in the family, you have a problem with me being the biggest, and the prettiest rock."
"No, no, no, no!"
It's just that I was curious about what kind of a rock would represent me as a person.
The standards for finding your rock...
Is about harmony.
Fitting in harmoniously with the other rocks that are sitting up here.
Harmony!
We just need to find that.
Whether you want to find one or not...
You do whatever you want.
"Whenever adults don't want to bother explaining something, they always make things confusing and just fumble over it."
Harmony?
What's that?
You happy?
-I've seen it.
-Ah.
One last time.
You can think of some priest who fits the bill?
-Come on.
"-No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
All right.
-You know who I think really did it?
-Who?
The Dominicans.
Go pick on them.
"I could have you deported, you know that?"
I lied.
You look like Sal Mineo.
"It looks like a type of disorder that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures."
"We call it, uh, somnambular-form possession."
"Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded by some alien intelligence."
Um....
"A spirit, if you will."
"Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum."
"-Well, it's out of--"
-And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away.
"Well, I'm sorry."
You're sorry?
Jesus Christ!
"Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is...."
"Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure."
"But, um, I think of it as a shock treatment."
"As I said, it's a very outside chance--"
It is possible.
A lot that would need to change for that to happen.
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
Why don't you stay at your own apartment tonight?
"My apartment is sad and has improper heating, which you know because we're standing in it right now."
So you don't want to be trapped by academia.
There are some people over there who I wish I could still call my colleagues.
They didn't want this life for themselves.
I told this to our boy here.
"You know, you have to be very careful."
Don't believe too strongly the structures they put in front of you.
This is good advice.
"For you more so than him, though."
Excuse me.
(WHISTLES QUIETLY)
You seem ill equipped to deal with someone like that.
We began by hating one another.
I think we're coming back down the other side now.
That's a very potent image.
You should write it down and use it.
"I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here."
I'm glad you approve.
"Oh, I do, indeed."
I should go check on her.
Excuse me.
I think you're being rude to Ike.
I'm glad his feelings are so important.
I think I need to leave.
The therapist.
What about her?
She's written her name in Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
Look.
Right here.
She did.
And this name...
Emile Sayles.
Same Handwriting.
"Looks like she signed him in, too."
Funny... she didn't mention that earlier.
"So, first, she treats the kid who committed suicide."
"Then a month later, she's at Kevin's funeral."
We got to find out what happened in those therapy sessions.
We got to go look at those files.
You want to get into the psychologist's confidential patient files off of a signature in a condolence book?
No.
"First, you look deeper into her and this Emile Sayles."
"Then we go to the judge, get a warrant, and then we go get her."
You understand?
Mm-hmm.
- Say you understand.
"- Don't... don't pull that ""say you understand"" thing with me."
That's... that's my thing.
"Well, don't you have a tank to get into or something?"
"""First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."""
"Yeah, right."
The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.
Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.
"What she was 12, this man..."
"Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does."
He pushed her until she broke.
Reproductive Biology Research Foundation.
"Did you, uh, check on top of the fridge?"
I already looked there.
"Well, then maybe Helen finished the frosted flakes."
But that's what I eat for breakfast every day.
"Well, then fry an egg, then."
Just don't leave the refrigerator door hanging open.
"Oh, I got to go."
Are you-- are you hiding from me?
Hiding?
No.
That would just be silly.
Because I-I just saw you talking with Virginia.
I'm hiding from you because I do not want to have this conversation.
Why?
What did Virginia say?
"First of all, there is nothing going on between her and Logan."
She said that?
"Well, of course she said that now."
"But what if you were to take her out for dinner, you know?"
- Maybe have a drink or two?
- No!
"My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them."
"Hey, hey."
Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.
"Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever."
The only person you can control is yourself.
"So, you got no relevant information out of her"
- about Logan.
"- Oh, for the love of God!"
Are you kidding me?
The placebo reaction.
"Oh, yes"
"Yes, grown up just like you"
I wonder if we'll meet again
Don't think too much
Go and get some medicine as per this prescription at Butterfly Valley
"Yes, guardian"
"Don't move, where is wu Ching Niu?"
what do you want with him?
"Never mind, just tell me"
"what, you're a girl?"
what are you up to anyway?
Disguised as a girl and looking for wu
My mother has been injured and I need Doctor wu where's your mom?
Mom
Mom
"Mom, how are you?"
How come you've been hurt so badly
Do you know where wu Ching Niu is?
Of course I do but he doesn't treat outsiders
I know
You're from the school of Ming Cult
You could say that because my name is Ji Shiau Fu
Then you are the heroine of Er Mei who gave birth to a daughter with Yang Siu ...1 8 years ago
Ashamedly yes
"Please Sit, wu Ji, fetch the medicine"
Yes
Doctor wu I haven't come here for treatment but have a favour to ask
what is it?
Since she's Left Guardian of Ming cult's daughter...
I was hoping you could deliver her to her father ...after I die
"Mother, you won't die..."
"Heroine Ji, what's your story with Guardian Yang?"
... fromstaffer to congressional assistant...
... untilthemayorofNewYorkCity came down to testify.
And he gave a speech that day...
... thatwillstaywithme for the rest of my life.
I went up to him and told him I admired him and what he stood for...
... andwhileIwas thankinghim...
... heaskedme if Ilikedstonecrabs .
"Halfway through dinner, I had a job."
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years...
"... andI finallyfoundaplace,where  you can make a difference."
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We gotta keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
"I gotta get that report, see where it leads."
"What if, while you're playing detective..."
... Wakeleydecides it'd be healthier to disappear?
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we gotta take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own...
... you'llfeelthefullweight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
It was nice.
"You know, my contract's up pretty soon."
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
- You're gonna be late.
- It's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
- I don't.
"No, it's not possible."
George is gonna kill me and so is Jim Jarmusch.
"Well, they can't both kill you."
Just call the dad and ask for it.
He will shoot me.
She's only 16 years old...
"Well, nearly 17."
Nearly 17.
"- You didn't sodomize her, did you?"
- No.
That's too bad.
You gotta be careful.
A lot of things fall under sodomy.
I wonder if kissing is sodomy.
Don't say that.
I need to get this screenplay.
I'm supposed to call Jarmusch and tell him what I think.
Ignore it.
Don't answer your phone.
That's what I would do.
But I don't want it to blow over.
I want this.
I can't work on my novel.
I need this job.
You let me know.
"Because what happened to me was, talking to you before, kind of stirred me up a little bit."
"Yeah, it did."
"And I realised that, you know, my opinions aren't generally taken into consideration."
"That's because in my line of activity, the attributes of loyalty are so much more important than your attributes of opinions."
"Cos, a bodyguard..."
What does a bodyguard do?
"He's gotta stay close to his subject at all times, all the time, and you're wondering what am I doing here right now, right?"
That is one thing that has gone right today.
"My name is Michael, and I'm here to help you."
"- Everything all right in there, Michael?"
- What is she doing?
She'll wait for us to make a move and pick us off when we do.
I need a screwdriver.
Shouldn't we call the park rangers?
"Unless the park rangers have been issued body armor... and high-caliber weapons, we're on our own here."
She must have disabled my gun when we stopped for gas.
Remove the trigger bar spring from a SIG Sauer P228... and you've got a nine-millimeter semiautomatic doorstop.
"I don't know what you think you're playing at, but this is not a game you can win."
"Doug, I need a paper clip."
Got one?
I don't have a paper clip.
"Well, do you have something like a paper clip,a thin piece of metal-"
Wait.
Never mind.
Kill him yourself if you want.
- We need to wrap this thing up.
- Oh.
Fiona.
- You fix it?
- Hardly.
I might get one shot off.
- You got one chance to shoot her?
- I'm not gonna shoot her.
- Wait.
- Is she leaving?
I seriously doubt that.
You have any duct tape?
Hold that there.
"When I say ""now,"" you're gonna open that door."
You're lost on this e?
Puzzled.
"They barely knew finn, yet they let him move in,loaned him money."
They trusted a man who took advantage of them.
"If you're in a relationship and the other person is keeping secrets, how would you know?"
You'd know.
I didn'T.
Who lied to you?
You did.
"Not exactly lied,but you just didn't tell me the whole truth either."
You're comparing me to finn?
I'm just saying that you can be involved with someone without fully knowing them.
How could you not tell me about your family?
Finish your e-mail.
You wanted my advice.
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.
Finn duped them.
And I shouldn't have brought up the past.
I know you had your reasons for not wanting to tk about it.
We're talking about it now.
Now is not paris.
Your priorities were clear on paris.
I had a job to do in europe.
"If I had told you about my first wife, would it have made a difference?"
"We'll never know,will we?"
yeah.Gibbs.
You went home early.
Stayed until 2130.
That's early for you.
"You called to talk about my work hours, Dr. Mallard?"
"No,agent gibbs."
I had a hunch which led me to trim lance corporal finn's nose hairs.
Please come in.
Miss Dashwood.
"Miss Marianne, it is both an honour and the greatest of pleasures to see you."
- I shall leave you for a little while.
- I am sure the Colonel would have you stay.
"Excuse me, I have much to do downstairs."
"Do please sit down, Colonel."
Thank you.
"Dear Colonel Brandon, I must convey my sincere gratitude for all that you..."
"Oh, let us leave that as said."
Excuse me.
I interrupted rudely.
I am embarrassed at being thanked for what was a privilege.
I only caught a glimpse of you the other night.
You're looking so much better.
You must be looking forward to going home to Barton.
"Yes, it seems a lifetime ago that we left for London."
Take things very quietly when you get back.
- Promise me.
"- I am grateful for your concern, Colonel."
Be assured I intend to do little but sit in the garden and read.
"Ah, Gothic novels, with their ghosts and ruined castles."
- Why not?
- I play the schoolmaster.
You read Cowper and Scott.
"You have heard of them, have you?"
I have studied them a little.
I think them truly wonderful.
"Oh, indeed they are great poets."
But have you not read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare?
"""Fear no more the heat of the sun"
"""Nor the furious winter's rages"
"We have a huge viral campaign push with cell phone cross promotion, playable demos that can be e-mailed with an embedded link to the site."
"We even posted game samples on Youtube, pointing towards the pre-purchase 10-day trial link"
- Brian.
- All right.
"I just wanted to add that Dave and I are scheduled to be on ""Game Gab"" tomorrow."
"Oh, that's great."
Half a million hits per day.
"Um, and where are we with your deal?"
"We haven't heard from your lawyer, Adam Hillman."
Right.
Uh... we're on it.
What about the bugs in the game?
"Dave, how are we doing on the bug thing?"
Dave?
The level three bugs?
It's bug.
Singular.
"It means, uh, it's all being resolved."
- We'll be ready for the duplicators
- Without a doubt?
We--we--just I.M.Ing the guys at the--at the shop.
It's gonna be fine.
It's all under control.
"""All under control""?"
That's the best you got?
It's a glitch in the code.
We'll figure it out.
"It could tank the whole game, Dave."
"Yeah, kinda like the fact that we don't have a signed contract which we would have if you actually talked to Adam instead of sticking his face under the sofa."
"Well, he started it."
"""He started it""?"
"What are you, 12?"
"Yes, Operation Sunshine, the protection of power and dam installations in Southern Norway, to prevent the Germans from destroying too much before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation with Parson as second in command and Skinnarland on radio duties.
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
Congratulations.
I thought this was what you always wanted.
"To go back to Norway, get out into the field again?"
"If you'd rather stay here just until the end of hostilities and then go and see your wife and children, it's no problem, I can..."
Of course not.
The war's not over yet.
"Thank you, sir."
Good man.
"Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get fishes like this in Norway.
"Not really, no."
Eugh!
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss the most about Norway?
"The horizons, wherever you look."
Yeah.
It's been a while.
You must come and visit.
My house is big.
"Well, that could be awkward."
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good bird-watchers.
It certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have a war.
Yes.
What else to it?
- Crusoe.
Robinson crusoe.
"stay right there, mr."
Crusoe.
Don't move an inch.
Why?
I said don't move!
You expect me to stand here while you try and shoot me?
So you can keep your secret and carry on living a lie?
Only so I can carry on living.
"Listen, I wish you no harm."
Then why were you spying on me.
I wasn't spying on you.
"I came to ask for your help, but you--"
This changes things.
I'm sorry I startled you.
"If you're in need of medical help, then my sex would be of no issue."
Are you planning something?
"Like I said, this changes things."
You don't trust me because I'm a woman?
I serve jacob moore because I'd be killed if I didn'T.
I do what I can for captain taylor because I have no wish to end up on the end of a rope should he regain command.
Self-preservation to the last.
"You're a castaway stranded on this island, mr."
Crusoe.
We're all slaves to self-preservation.
Takes courage to live as I do.
More than if I were a man.
I'll find another way.
What if I tell the mutineers you're out here?
And what if I tell them that you're a woman?
Whose life would become more unbearable then?
Pass!
Come here.
Why did you go alone?
Why didn't you pass?
But I...
"Don't ""but"" me!"
playing the game is a team responsibility.
Responsibility?
"Well, I definitely see how something could have slipped out of there."
Absolutely.
That would have fallen right out in the middle of the bed.
What about Charlie's hole?
"Just get into the bed, please, and show us how you sleep, guys."
"Well, right off the bat, I think there's a clear solution could have prevented this entire thing."
You guys need to get two beds.
"Oh, maybe I'll get two TVs and two refrigerators."
What are you talking about?
Do we come to your house and tell you how to sleep?
I sleep in a king-sized bed by myself.
"When I have to go to the bathroom, I use a toilet."
Look at...
He...
Dennis on his bed made for kings with his toilet made out of gold.
"Okay, guys, everybody calm down, please."
This is not about lifestyle.
This is not about judgments.
"This is about truth, okay?"
"Now, Charlie and Frank, show us how you were positioned the night of the incident."
Excuse me.
Incidents.
"All right, well, I'm pretty sure I was sleeping like this that night."
"It's just, like, no way it could have been me."
"That it made me realize that, uh,"
"I need to be honest, too."
"I made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor,"
But I never quite realized until now that...
The greatest sacrifice of all
Was my family.
So the most important thing that I can say here tonight
"Is not to all of you,"
"But, uh, to them."
"I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you,"
And I promise to do everything in my power
"To make it up to you, to make it right again,"
Because I love you.
"My, oh, my."
Did Dr. Van Der Woodsen
Just make a public pass at Rufus' wife?
Looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries.
"Well, I guess you were right about William,"
"But it doesn't matter how he feels about me,"
Because I don't love him.
"I love you, Rufus."
"I know you're comfortable with him, Lil, but I'm not."
I need you to find another doctor.
"Look, I understand why you don't trust him,"
"But surely, you trust me."
"Look, I don't want to fight with you, Rufus."
"Okay, we'll put it aside till tomorrow."
Let's get you home. you know what?
"Right now, more than anything,"
"I just need a quiet night, alone."
Lily.
"Please, just for tonight,"
With beautiful costumes and a full orchestra.
[slow-paced orchestral music]

Splendid!
Splendid!
"What do you think of it now, Tyler?"
"Uh, shouldn't Miss Chummy appear for Mr. Tyler's benefit?"
"You see, uh, Judge Peterby owns a small piece of the show."
"I've contributed, not only in the shape of money but also in the shape of, uh, Miss Chummy."
- Like it?
- It looks pretty good.
We have enough capital for a good show but we wanna put on a great show.
"Your 15,000 would allow us to do it."
"Hmm, well, I feel it needs certain changes."
"Now, the Bill Robinson number."
"I think if you played that in a street in Harlem, you'd get more out of it."
"Good idea, we'll use it."
Right Grady?
Right.
Miss Chummy brings a new personality into the theater.
"Uh, my advice would be to accept the boys' generous offer, Tyler."
"You don't have to sell me, Commodore."
"All I wanna know is, will I have a voice in the production?"
"As a partner, you'll have as much to say as Grady and myself."
"They've adopted a little idea of mine, Tyler."
"Low doses of methaqualone-- downers, ludes, disco biscuits."
Very retro but making a comeback.
It was just enough to impair
Petty Officer Adams' motor skills.
"I mean, these babies can increase your sex drive, but it also can cause drowsiness and slurred speech, low heart rate, vomiting..."
"Ah, well, so much for the sex part."
So the question is: who slipped it to him and where?
"Well, test everyone who was on liberty that night."
Can I borrow McGee to help?
Absolutely.
"And I swear, your grandma got these crazy eyes and took off after your mom like a cat chasing a mouse."
"Ooh, I can still see them eyes."
"Would Grandma have chased us, Mom?"
"Yeah, she sure would have."
"Nah, she'd be spoiling you guys every chance she got."
"Right, Jack?"
"Yes, Michael, she would have."
"Hey, thanks for letting me stay."
"Well, the kids miss seeing you."
I miss them.
"Just gonna let the old man sleep through the party, huh?"
"Uncle Mike's got great stories, Dad."
"- You finish your paper, son?"
- Yep.
"Nine whole pages, single-spaced."
- Nice.
- Uncle Mike fixed the dishwasher.
"Oh, just a loose valve."
No big deal.
"Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Fix-It, but let's go."
It's my day to drop the kids off at school.
Can Uncle Mike come?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were serious.
- At least you get letters.
"- Oh sure, Lily."
Most of the poets that come in here don't even want to see my face when they fuck me.
"- Rule number one is to make them cum, right?"
"They come in five minutes, they owe you for half an hour."
- Good.
What else?
"- Ah, but a professional always offer a massage, so the guy doesn't feel like a total loser."
- And
- it's the best way to get another half an hour out of the prick.
- That's my girl.
* And night falls on a weekend day
* And all the young and some old
* Come out to play
* And some of us drink to laugh
* Some of us drink to cry
* But everyone drinks to leave life
* For a while
* And anywhere's better than here *
- When were you last employed?
"- Um, well, I, uh,"
I do volunteer work?
"- I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't make myself very clear."
"When did you last cease full-time, paid employment?"
"- Paid, um."
It's about two years ago.
"- Well, that's the reason why you're currently under review for your Newstart Allowance."
We just need to be making sure that you're still actively looking for work.
"- Yeah, I have been."
I have been.
They said your father could be released.
"We compared out destinies, like young girls comparing dresses."
Now she was going to be reunited with a saint.
"A martyr, beautiful... noble."
"Her gift was living, and she got theater instead."
My gift was theater.
Instead I got snarled up in life...
So it goes.
She went back.
She died of love.
I waited here for a visa that's never issued to dissidents' sister-in-laws.
And I became as bad at acting as I am in life.
"""It's like the sky in the country""."
"It's the Atlantic, the wind from the ocean."
You know we have seagulls here in Paris?
"That's what I'm doing at the moment, The Seagull."
"Well, the play."
My daughter plays the lead.
"Nowadays, after two cheap porno films, you can even become a member of the Academy."
She arranged for me to have a part in the play.
Do you know it?
Not really.
Sea birds don't fly to Hungary.
And what kind of bird are you?
What do you do in Hungary?
I was told to work with my hands.
My head still hurts.
A bird of different feather.
"I'm sorry, you make me feel uneasy."
Nestor?
To the theater!
"The bird touches down on the mud, leaves his mark, more beautiful than his flight, than his life."
It's bad enough you let the guy go.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Assaulting a federal officer is always a big deal, and you know it."
The fact that you didn't arrest him tells me you're not thinking straight.
"Look, don't worry about me, King."
All right?
I'm fine.
Let's just get back to work.
"Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead on the stolen money."
"Yeah, I'm on it."
I don't see anything.
Where's the lead?
"Well, it's actually not my lead, so..."
"Took you long enough, Percy."
I don't exactly have all day.
"Yeah, sorry, something came up."
You called Gregorio.
E-mailed.
"And it was just some serial numbers, so this was all her choice."
"It's not a big deal, Pride."
"Well, actually it is."
"The bills came from a bank robbery in Biloxi, Mississippi, six weeks ago."
A teller slipped a dye pack into the money before the robbers took off.
Seems that makes our marine a bank robber.
Doesn't explain why Jared was stabbed or who'd want to kill him.
How many robbers in Biloxi?
"Witnesses said there were four, including a getaway driver, heavily armed, too."
SONJA:
"So, robbers turning against each other?"
What's going on?
"Oh, hey, Hannah."
Agent Pride.
"- Well, she hasn't."
"The guidance system malfunctioned at the point of re-entry, so instead of the Atlantic Ocean,"
- she may well be in this area.
- (MARSH):
Are you sure?
The American consulate in Nagoro just radioed me.
I've been out alerting all the village chiefs.
"Well, having been on a lunar orbit,"
"I'd say that at this moment,"
Sally is the world's most valuable chimp.
(SCREECHES)
"As soon as she's found, she has to be given a very complete examination."
"Now, the American consulate in Nagoro is sending out a truck with a military and scientific attaché, but they don't know the area as well as we do."
"Poor thing, she might've been injured in the landing."
Or what about possible attack by another animal in the bush?
"Uh, she has to be in an exhausted condition, so wherever she is she's in serious jeopardy."
"Mike, get me a dart rifle from the truck."
- Mmm.
"- Hedley, I'll go with you."
- Good.
"- Jack, you and Mike take a look down by the river."
"And, Paula, you stick right here by the radio."
(JUDY CHATTERING)
"Look, Judy, come on now."
This is no time for fun and games.
Come on.
Get over there.
"Go on, scoot."
(ENGINE STARTS)
(SCREECHING)
"Come on, Judy, we have work to do."
You heard the Daktari.
"Look, Martha Dumptruck, revenge of the nerds, and hello kitty -- they rode the same bus."
"Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"Well, that would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"Dean, there's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles."
"Then whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative -- well, that's super."
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty!"
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
"Man, I don't get it."
"No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here."
"Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair."
"I mean, hell, a hangnail."
Something's got to be tying the ghost to this place.
We just got to find it.
Yeah.
Got a new driving permit.
Issued two weeks ago.
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk McGregor sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
- McGregor?
- Yeah.
Why?
I knew his son.
Jesus.
What if I fall asleep and all the good stuffs taken away instead?
They'd have to find it first.
"I am your superior, you know that?"
"Harry, why don't you just stop gambling?"
"Look, I have patches for my addictions."
They have patches for porn?
Why are you really here?
You're making my girls nervous.
I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau.
Why has he called in my debt?
- Belshazzar was the king of Babylon.
- Here we go.
A man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends.
Just like Freddie Lau?
"One evening, he holds a fabulous feast for them all."
"But during the feast, Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall."
- It predicts...
- Belshazzar's own death.
"So, what, you're saying that someone's threatening to kill Freddie Lau?"
Why else would Lau be planning to sell up and leave London?
"Ah, come on, Kaleem."
Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out.
You're not telling me something.
"Come on, leave now."
I have to watch my girls like a hawk.
"Oh, did that um..."
missing stripper of yours ever turn up?
- What was her name?
- Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday.
- Matched her description.
I said ifs not Zaer Kheder's order
You will go neither to Zaer Kheder nor to Tangak_ That's it!
"So, sorry to disturb you, Bashirou's mommy."
- It's early to leave.
"- I leave, I have something to do."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye
- Don't bother yourself.
- Please.
"It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
What did you say?
"- It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
- Don't talk nonsense.
Did you look at yourself?
"They forced your father to drive out of Tangak, they did it to me."
"What the hell are you going to do there, as a baby boy?"
You are a little boy.
Are you such a man to go to Tangak?
So?
Donkey work!
"Pottering, minor works and difficulties are for mine and playing Ketfledrum for the others'."
Just you tell me is it fair?
"Bashirou, tell me definitely how much?"
"- Playing Kettledrum, definitely."
"- No, ifs not the way."
From morning to dawn.
You are headstrong like your father
"Obstinate, dogged, inflexible, tough."
"If I wasn't headstrong, how could I play Kettledrum till dawn?"
Ashoura is perennial; ifs not going to be finished this year.
"Next year, God willing."
"Don't say God willing, Zaer or say it in the way means ""yes""."
Now!
Shoot a propane tank and you'll just get a big cloud of cold gas.
You need an open flame and real good aim.
Get down!
"Yeah, Sam, I had to drive around, make sure we weren't followed."
She could be anywhere now.
Gotta go.
- What's happening?
- We'll get to that.
"- For now, I need to know why someone wants you dead."
- It's a long story.
"Well, that's a long story that starts with Greenway Cargo, right?"
- Give me the short version for now.
- I was the controller.
"Uh, mostly wrote checks, did invoices."
It was a job.
I've been a C.P.A. for 15 years.
- Need to get to the marked for death part.
- After a while...
I realized I was paying vendors I'd never heard of... for cargo that was never delivered.
- Front companies.
"- They were into all kinds of stuff- weapons, ivory, human cargo."
Th-That's what the F.B.I. said.
"Anyway, they came to my house, said they were investigating the company, investigating me."
- Unless you testify.
"- I didn't want to get involved, but they said I'd go to jail."
I said I'd think about it.
Then- things started happening.
- Things?
What things?
"- I had people following me... phone calls, guys watching my house."
Then my wife... goes out in my car.
"What was that, uh, legal stuff that Audrey wanted to talk to you about this morning?"
Nothing.
Just estate planning.
[laughing]
"Hey, listen, uh, there's no reason we should both be here waiting for the check."
Why don't you go get the kids?
And I'll see you back at the place.
Sure.
[ting]
Cheers.
"Hey, guys."
So what are we celebrating?
You guys being perfect strangers this morning and now fast friends?
How are you planning on robbing Audrey?
"- No, no..."
"- No, no, no, no, Lance."
You got it all wrong.
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
"Okay, then, Cousin Pete, explain."
Let's hear a perfectly reasonable explanation for how you came to be sitting here celebrating with the man who just bought your grandmother's farm for a price that would be insultingly low if the place were currently on fire.
- Get you anything?
- I'm good.
Okay.
"Come on, fellas."
You're caught.
"You can waste time trying to deny it, or we start to talk about what it's going to take to get me not to turn you in."
Gentlemen.
Two years ago...
"I was going through security at Sea-Tac, and, uh, all of a sudden..."
this is long story sounding...
TSA goes ape shit.
"The, uh, airport cops are hauling ass towards us."
All right?
"What if our guy knew her at church, work, or something... and he's obsessed with her?"
But she dies.
She donates her organs... and he goes after the people that have them.
"Now, postmortem wrist wounds... blood loss speeds the decay of the organs."
"The result is, they can't be passed on again."
I'm betting that this girl Davison... is the donor for all of our victims...
"Getz, Tattersall, and Emma."
Emma is not dead.
I heard back from Ned in Indiana.
The latest victim was a heart transplant.
"If you'll excuse me, gentlemen..."
Emma.
"Please, it's Dr. Pierce."
I've been trying to reach you all day.
"Emma, listen."
The donor I talked to you about... her family is threatening to sue.
Her mother had religious objections... to harvesting her daughter's organs... even though her daughter was a voluntary donor.
"I don't think they have a case, but..."
Are you listening to me?
Her lawyer just called.
She needs to see you.
She needs to see how her daughter's cornea... has changed your life.
"Because it has, Emma."
"Whether you like it or not, it has."
Where does she live?
Is this Leslie's?
"You're Russian, you go to a Russian church?"
Yes.
"Um, Davisovich is our ancestral name."
Where did Leslie work?
Illinois Masonic... on Wellington.
- Thank you.
And I also noticed a certain linguistic similarity with Bennet's recent work.
Well...
- That's...
"- Carrie, I'm not an idiot."
I know you wrote the parachute pants piece for him.
I just...
I really wanted to help Bennet out.
Stop worrying about Bennet.
Think about yourself.
Because this piece is going in the magazine under your name.
Mouse!
Have you seen Pete?
"Uh, no."
I thoughouyou guys were hanging out today.
"Well, we were supposed to."
"And then this morning, he called while I was out and told me my mom that he's leaving tonight."
And now I can't find him anywhere.
"Okay, don't panic."
I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.
Why'd I let you convince me to scare him off with my onion breath and my hairy legs?
"We were just trying to help, so you wouldn't make the same mistakes you kept making in the past."
"Great, well, now you helped me right out of a boyfriend."
"It's not too late, you know, to make your own mistakes."
How would I do that?
"Well, he took the bus here, right?"
So go down to the bus station and wait for him there.
And tell him what?
Whatever your instincts tell you to say.
"Oh, God."
That's probably my dad.
"Hey, Bennet."
"- Yeah, we have a great blooper reel."
- My God.
I wanna see it so badly.
- Click on over.
- Stop this commentary immediately.
"- Hey, that was my hand."
- Kat Dennings does her own inserts.
Because nobody else can do it right.
"I don't think that my hand acting in the scene with the toilet ended up in there, right?"
That was cut?
"- No, your hand is..."
- When she looks in the hole and my hand goes over it.
"- No, that didn't make it."
- They cut that out.
- That didn't make it.
"- God, your fault, so hard."
If anyone's gonna get raped in that van...
And this is so...
This gets a huge laugh.
"Sorry, I told you I didn't think that rape line was gonna work."
Yeah.
"No, it's fine."
Did you tell me that night?
"Yeah, because you guys started bringing the scene in..."
You started to re-create the scene and it was going really well but then that rape line I thought was never gonna work.
It was never gonna play funny.
But it's one of the biggest laughs in the film.
I think that some people definitely won't like it.
So I think your instinct was...
- I was playing it safe.
"- Well, rape isn't a joke, Michael."
- What'd you say?
Why?
I don't know!
"I was with Jonesy, and we were just looking Felix up on the net, just a something to do."
And his family was so stinking rich.
They just wound me up!
"People like me have to duck and die, for these blue-blood types have got it all!"
"It was just a laugh, you know?"
A little note to remind him that he wasn't so important after all!
"Not that he felt that way, as it turns out."
- You utter prick.
"- Oh, it was just a postcard!"
How was I supposed to know he'd bloody kill himself?
You couldn't have known.
He must have been unstable... like his brother.
It wasn't your fault.
See?
- Did you do that?
- Let go of me.
- Truth!
Did you do that to him?
- He did it to himself.
"I sat by him for days, weeks."
I knew that he was still alive inside.
"I knew that he'd be ashamed of what he did, ashamed of his weakness."
I knew that he'll tell me who's to blame
"Imagine being like Felix... paralysed, powerless!"
You'd hurt whoever you could!
You wanted Felix to name names.
We were the last people to piss him off.
But it doesn't justify his suicide.
And it doesn't justify this revenge.
Perhaps you're right.
"""He was so pleased that he held our hands tightly..."
"""and did not want to let go for quite some time."
"""But he was very disappointed that Grandma did not come."
"""He repeatedly asked us what was wrong with her..."
"""and we didn't know how to answer him."
"""Since Grandma had said no..."
"""we came to see Suzujiro on her behalf..."

-To Hawaii.
"""I also think it's a good idea."

"You should go, absolutely."
He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
"Run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us."
We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.
Why are you still here?
You're being cautious.
You're being... common.
When you don't give a crap about... how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?
Let me know when that happens.
Then we can have this conversation.
"It's just another case, huh?"
"Gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing."
"Boy, I wish I had your job."
Biopsy showed nothing.
How can there be nothing?
You cut out a piece of my brain.
It's nothing personal.
We just didn't find anything.
Can you up his morphine for god's sake?
"He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour."
What about toxins?
Everything was negative.
There was a cupboard above the stove.
Did you see it?
"I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis."
We didn't go back.
Follow right.
Who did?
House said we shouldn't go.
Too dangerous.
The answer's gotta be in that apartment.
Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, you want to grab One of those samples, sam?"
Yeah.
Zeke tenhoff and his brother sam.
"Are assessing the fruits Of their day's labor,"
As they work to secure A mineralrights.
Claim on the grounds.
With the state of alaska.
"Yeah, this is the sample That was from, like,"
Far away from the hole As I could get.
My immediate goal For the start of this ice season.
Is to collect enough samples To be able to prove.
That there is A longterm resource of gold.
Out at that prehistoric Beach line at hastings creek.
"Once I have that data, I can start."
"The claiming And leasing process,"
To have unrestricted access To the area for the longterm.
"I hate to be the pessimist,"
But this just looks like A bucket full of sand to me.
I do kinda wish maybe I was Panning from samples.
"That were full of red And black sand,"
Instead of just old Prehistoric pebbles.
It's in here.
I mean...
Okay.
We got one tiny little speck.
It's right there.
Speck of gold.
Tiny little speck of fine gold.
That's not gonna Pay the bills.
It's not gonna pay the bills.
"The first samples that I was Able to take, not looking good."
"I mean, by brother's not happy."
The vice president is scheduled to preside over a Senate vote today on President Sawyer's controversial Middle East peace plan.
"Then tomorrow, the vote will go to Congress."
Republicans and Democrats have indicated they will vote along party lines but some members have indicated that they may cross over.
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.
Carol.
He wants to do the thing.
- Really?
- Really.
"Mr. President, it isn't a good idea to deviate from the flight plan."
"Pretty please, Carol?"
"Leader of the free world saying ""pretty please""?"
That ought to count for something.
"Captain Johns, we are going to deviate from Route Omaha."
The president would like to do the thing.
Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.
Dropping to 30 feet.
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president who was in favour of women having the vote?
He wrote a paper on suffrage while he was still in the Illinois legislature.
"Yes, I did know that because you tell me every time we do this."
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
"We are short Foxtrot, one minute out."
- I need a go-no go.
"- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground all clear, three inbound."
"Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report."
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground."
You are clear.
Scanning sky south.
Clear.
England.
Not Birmingham.
The British bobby cannot be bought.
"- You, shut your face."
- Sorry.
- What are you offering?
- Nothing.
You must speak to my lawyer.
"What, old pervy Spurty?"
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
"Right now, everything seems to be in order here."
"I would stand by you, Richie, but lost causes depress me."
Toodly-woodly.
"Right, Spurty, do your stuff."
"Your Honour, I wandered into a garden, under the impression it was my garden."
"On seeing items of women's laundry hanged on the line,"
I naturally assumed that my wife had done some washing and I began to get it in for her.
"The fact that I live in a high-rise flat and am not married is circumstantial evidence and, hence, inadmissible."
Right.
"Well, we'd better escape."
Against Leon Brittan's law and order initiative?
Never!
No choice.
"The meat is in my trousers, Tarby is coming round to hear his golfing anecdote and you're banged up in the slammer."
Don't be disgusting.
I've never been banged up the slammer.
You're right.
We've gotta escape.
I have a plan.
What we have to do is set up a complicated system of stooges to find out exactly what the guards are up to.
"Then, we dig three tunnels and hide the dirt in our trousers."
Going back to that house is what Violet wanted.
You try telling her what to do.
"I'd like to, but I haven't had the chance."
You're handling it.
I need your help.
I'll stop by this afternoon.
Thank you.
I was eyeing that apple.
The pressure in his brain is still not coming down.
Continue the mannitol and hyperventilate him to a P.C.0.2 of 35.
Hey.
What happened?
Cerebral contusion.
He wouldn't stop seizing.
I had to induce a barbiturate coma.
"Neuro put a pressure monitor in, but I can't get the pressure to come down."
So he may die?
Yeah.
Little bit of justice.
I'm just saying.
"Sam, if he dies..."
Michelle could be charged with murder.
"And what, Tammy has a father who's dead and a mother in jail?"
"All right, well, now you're just making me feel bad, so stop it."
"Michelle, if you don't tell the truth now, you'll go to jail."
I am.
I just don't buy it.
You're still trying to protect some image that you have of your family or of Darren.
"It wasn't an accident, and if he dies, you will be charged with manslaughter or worse."
"You have to stop protecting him, if not for yourself, then for your daughter."
Think about Tammy.
I am.
I've been through all my clients and there's lots of prospects.
There's something about a group of tree hugging horsey people on a mission.
But have you even thought about what's gonna happen when all these people start showing up?
Matt's gonna know.
"I mean, they have to deal with him."
"Well, I've got time to talk Matt around."
"Actually, you don't have any time at all."
I just heard.
Meat truck's coming... tomorrow.
Hi there.
"Um, nice to see you again."
Will-will Clint be joining us today?
"Actually, my boss is on vacation, so all twelve of your emails were forwarded to me."
"Judging by the content of some of them, I'm sure you weren't aware."
So how would you like to go about these interviews?
"Well, protocol states that I should start with you and Peter."
Of course.
"Um, separately."
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, who would you like to..."
interrogate first?
You.
"And Mrs. Morris, this is not an interrogation."
This is for the good of your child.
It's okay.
There you go.
"That doesn't hurt, now, does it?"
You don't think I'd hear about what you're up to?
It's a small town!
You're just supposed to make sure these horses are healthy.
Not break them.
- What can you afford?
"100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once."
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.
"20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right."
I'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?
"No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company..."
How comfortable!
They will be much more able to give you something.
Marianne.
can you play something else?
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.
I meant something less mournful.
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne.
Elinor.
"- Mamma, we have nowhere to go."
- John and Fanny will be here soon.
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them?
Vultures!
I will start making inquiries for a new house at once.
"Until then, we must try to bear their coming."
"Margaret, are you there?"
"Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon."
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.
"Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter."
It is the law.
"- Come, we'll play with your atlas."
- It's not mine.
"Come on, dude."
The line is moving.
It's been half an hour.
There are extra classes at school on Saturday and Sunday.
We have to come to school 5 days a week and stay behind for extra lessons 3 times.
"Besides this, you still have a lot to catch up with from past years."
I've made a list of books that you should buy.
Be sure to get them as soon as possible.
"Preparation for Student Selection Exam, The Exam Questions of the last... 10 years, Writing Guide, Turkish Texts 1, Applied Math 2..."
Dictionary of Idioms.
What's all this?
Perfect for a start.
We should get started in an easy mode.
Easy?
Yes.
I got the Lotto Papers.
What do we do now?
Fill it out right away.
We don't have much time left.
Hold on a second.
Let's catch our breath.
You have a maximum of one minute for each question.
Pay attention to the questions.
The choices are full of tricks.
Which of the options below is not meant in this paragraph?
Which of the following is not even there at all?
Be careful with negative and reverse questions.
They will do their best to make us fail.
Bastards!
I never knew there were so many tricks involved.
I'm exhausted.
Let's sit down somewhere for a few minutes.
"""No, no, no, no."""
"""No, no, no, no."""
"""Blue eyes enhanced with Delhi's kohl invites me."""
"""How do I come close to you?"
"How do I hug you?"""

"""You'll leave me after bothering me."""
"""After you've finished lying to me."""

"When you work here, you don't think about home"
- and families and babies.
- That's not fair.
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year...
"Let me tell you something, Stephanie."
"Maybe you don't know how babies are made, because when people are trying, they know they're trying!"
I was wrong to say we didn't know about the case.
It's regrettable.
"What exactly does it mean, that Ussing is listed in that book?"
"In light of the prosecutor's negligence and the testimony you pointed out, it is something that we're keeping a keen eye on."
- As a suspect?
- it's a possibility.
Right now we're focusing on finding the perpetrator.
The book won't be of much use to him.
It only contains car registrations.
He's wounded.
We'll catch him soon.
Then we'll hopefully also know what's happened to Emilie Zeuthen.
Will Ussing be investigated?
We'll leave it to Special Branch and the police.
Focus on our duel with Ussing tomorrow.
I'm not slinging mud without more intel.
"You must admit, things aren't too bad."
- Lebech would like to meet again.
"- Bloody hell, is she serious?"
The Centre Party have made their choice.
Will you check on the event tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll go in five minutes.
See you.
"Thank you for all your efforts, Karen."
I want you to know they mean a lot.
- It's my job.
"- Yes, but anyway..."
Do you have a minute?
"No, not really."
I'm off to the Ministry of Justice to check up on Mogens.
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
Like what?
I don't know.
One of my favorite ones is the one about you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.
"Well, they have the decency to bury me, at least?"
Can't say.
Don't really keep track of the rumors I didn't start.
Got any rumors about me being made sheriff?
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna like you coming back.
"Well, he's gonna find he ain't got much room to argue."
Maybe I don't like you coming back.
"You know I always told you, you deserve better than this."
Marla.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
"Hey, how come that thing always stayed broken?"
Don't got a phone connection at my ma's old house anymore.
"Marla was good about looking after it, but..."
Use that one.
You ever hear anything about me getting murdered?
"Yes, sir, I believe I have."
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?
- Yeah.
- No kidding?
"Heard you was mouthing off like you used to, and... somebody just shot you right there how you stood."
"Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna welcome me back from the dead?"
Asshole.
Armor-piercing.
"- They call them ""cop killers."""
- Why is that?
On account of them killing cops.
"Do you need it for, like, DNA?"
Forensics lab is two weeks and 150 miles away from giving half a shit about this town.
- Water.
Firewater.
- Very funny.
Don't worry.
The man is trustworthy.
There won't be any problems.
"After his escape, we'll hide him here."
"As soon as things have calmed down, we'll take him to the cloister."
I'll be there.
"Hey, guys, we have a new guest."
"Well, I'll be damned!"
"If this isn't Smithy, Jaguar Carrasco's right-hand man."
How does it feel to be here as a European who is paid for playing a revolutionary?
"Amigo, we're your friends."
You look as if they've tortured you quite badly.
Why don't you lie down?
You can even have my bed.
This is John.
"They haven't treated him well, either."
They've pumped him with drugs.
"That's Alfonso, a journalist whose sole intention was to write about the truth."
"Joaquín, a poor fool who put up a banner in front of the palace."
"Come on, sit down."
- How long have you been here?
- A few years.
You can get used to anything.
"There's light and air, and sometimes you even get food."
"Some go mad, others cope."
You'll have to see which group you belong to.
Just don't think too much.
It's a great honour to shake hands with a friend of Carrasco's.
We've heard about the dam.
Jesus... can I just have a few minutes?
We wanna know who you are.
"We'll find out, you know."
Sooner or later.
You could save us some legwork by communicating with us now.
Are you a Satanist?
You in some kind of cult?
"Coz if there are others involved, we'll find them too, believe me."
What's the matter?
Is that it?
Is there someone you wanna tell me about?
I'm sorry.
The Nurse at reception downstairs is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.
Says it's urgent.
I'm coming
I'll be right back.
yeah
His daughter?
When was this -- is she still here...?
"did she leave any information, a phone number...?"
What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph..."
"There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might."
"Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal."
The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past...
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
Now and Later... the really tasty treat...
Now and Later... the flavor can't be beat..
Look at all those pieces
I heard that.
Hey you're not supposed to be talking while you're driving!
Well I already lost Jesse to Hannah.
And now I can't go to college.
Because I was busy selling out stadiums.
And meeting the Queen of England.
Instead of holding a spit bucket for the girls wrestling team!
Ow!
Look I know.
I was really thinking about this.
You know what if you said you were Hannah Montana's assistant?
I mean that way you still did all the stuff but as her assistant.
You couldn't have thought of that 200 miles ago?
"[Singing to the tune of ""On the Road Again""]"
In the car again.
Miley Stewart's back in the car again.
Driving places she has already been.
Miley's arriving back to school again.
Yee-haw!
Today our topic is heartbreak and disappointment.
Who out there has lost a boyfriend recently or a good friend.
Or maybe didn't get into the college they wanted to get into?
I.
Nice try honey.
I'm a visual manifestation of your over-stressed subconscious.
And I'm with you for the next 200 miles.
So you're a mess.
Let's start from there.
Hannah Montana's assistant?
That sounds fascinating.
Why didn't you include that in your application?
Miss Montana likes me to keep it very low profile.
I can see why you don't do this face to face.
It can be very awkward.
Hi.
And then you'd say...
"""Hi."
"How was your day?"""
"Oh, me?"
"I had a really weird day, actually."
And now I'm here... alone in my apartment.
You're probably in your big house... with your family...
and your dog.
And probably your dog has a family too.
You're probably all gathered around the fire singing carols... even though it isn't Christmas.
Just for fun.
"You will never, ever see this... because you'll never watch this far on the tape."
"You'll probably never even watch the tape, will you?"
I could do anything right now.
"If you are watching this... then just call this number, okay?"
"Just call this number, the number you see on your screen... and say ""macaroni. """
Okay?
That's all you have to do.
"Just ""macaroni""and hang up."
No questions asked.
I thought we'd have breakfast for dinner.
And then maybe sometime we'll have dinner for breakfast.
Just to mix things up a little.
But there's still ice cream for dessert.
It's fine with me if you guys want to continue this silent treatment.
It's like a Zen retreat for me.
- Can I see it?
- I didn't use the book.
I made it up.
Should I go on?
No!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Please!
"Take us to Schmidt, I won't say another word."
"Come on, Dixon."
I'm in a hurry.
Don't forget your Oreos.
"Counterintelligence, broadly speaking, is the practice of spying on someone who's spying on you."
"With a little patience, you can learn a surprising amount about your enemies just by watching their own surveillance teams."
"It starts with carefully observing who's at what location, when they're there, and how often."
"Once you have a list of possible candidates, you cross-reference with people from other surveillance sites."
"If anybody shows up more than once, it's a safe bet it's not just a coincidence."
It's a lot easier to keep your secrets if you know who's after them.
Gotcha.
Why can't we just knock on the door?
You don't know Calvin Schmidt.
He's not gonna open the door for five people with guns.
It's okay.
So I-I have to be your pretend girlfriend?
Come on.
Here we go.
Kiss for luck?
Never mind.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Hi, Calvin."
It's really --
Was I -- was I unclear the last time we spoke?
"I gave you a fat stack of cash, and I told you to forget my address."
"Yes, I know."
"But look, look -"
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
"Let the record show that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr. Hill identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document....
The hardest thing was leaving the life.
I still loved the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all just for the asking.
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because they will do anything to survive.
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.
-l know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay back the bookies.
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
When I was broke I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"- Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
- Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
- That's right.
"- It'll be very dirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
- Shall I give you the key?
- Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""masses-media"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
- The keys...
And now you think of something beautiful...
"Oh, my Lord."
it hurts so bad...
Bruno!
Check if the water's already boiling!
And bring the hot towels from the dryer!
A boy!
Where is he?
...And so I can only say:
my dear Mrs John... a la bonheur!
Thanks a lot.
"Look at it, Mr Hassenreuter:"
A seven-month-old child and already it looks just as big as my own.
"""Explain to me, Count Oerindur, this dilemma of nature!"""
"Why ""dilemma""?"
There is no dilemma!
"You're absolutely right, Mrs John."
With such a giant as father...
"Well, he'll be in for a surprise, right, Mrs John?"
Don't blow your smoke in my child's face!
Don't be surprised then if your child still looks like a seven month-old one.
That is not due to my smoking!
"That's all down to his father, that blue-blooded weakling who tried to prove that I couldn't bring up a child!"
But he lost the case yesterday.
I got full custody.
"- Well, I congratulate you."
- Thanks!
"Could we also look at the new one, Mrs John?"
"And the alimony too, 75 Mark monthly."
Learn to hate the alimonies that come from cultivated human hands!
"Little enough, when I consider that it was pure pleasure for these gentlemen, and for me just..."
"- Regardez les enfants, Madame Knobbe!"
Tony...
He's the owner of the delicatessen.
Saying that the voice was a mars.
"But, the below average height and the fact that the voice was disguised and it was muffled by the mask..."
All indicate at least the possibility of a doubt as to the gender.
"The lab is going to be running some more tests on that makeup, so I'll report tomorrow."
"You should be on salary, sir, with these hours."
I feel I am.
Good working with you.
Thank you.
(COLUMBO HUMMING)
(KNOCKING)

(CLEARS THROAT)
"I guess I just got carried away, sir."
I hope you don't mind.
"No, no."
It's all right.
"These shoes, sir, they're really terrific."
"Now I know why, Lieutenant Lucerne, he always look so tall."
"Yes, well, I would appreciate a certain amount of discretion in that matter, Lieutenant."
"Public image, you know."
"Oh, right, sir."
"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about a thing, sir."
"As far as I'm concerned, you're four inches taller than I am."
And that's the end of it.
"Thank you, Lieutenant Columbo."
"My pleasure, Lieutenant Lucerne."
"Sir, I got the second lab report on the mask, so I hurried right over."
Yes?
"It turns out that it probably isn't a woman, sir."
"You see, it was actor's makeup."
"We didn't know what it was, but people were terrified."
"Hurry, get in the house."
I went with some of the other men to investigate.
"We found the wreckage, a few wounded survivors."
We didn't know what they were.
We decided to take no chances.
"We slaughtered them, burned the bodies."
Wise decision.
"Unfortunately we didn't get them all, and although none of us saw it, evidently, one of them survived."
It took its first victim that very night.
"We tried to hunt it down, but we couldn't find it."
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
"Two years after the crash, it took my own son."
That's it?
"One wraith, in the forest?"
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"We'll all go together, in the daylight."
You're really going to help us?
"Well, like the man said, it's just one wraith."
It'd be downright unneighborly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
"Uh, well, let's not forget the food."
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daimos?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads, and it can turn you to stone just by looking at you."
"Well, you heard wrong."
Let's see what we find here.
"All right, looks like your basic super model diet."
"Diet pills, vodka, cigarettes."
Gabriel.
At least this confirms that she was here.
- No sign of a struggle.
- No sign of anything.
- What about blood?
- No.
All right.
"Well, I guess we're done here."
Somebody's coming.
Hey!
Hi!
"If you guys were planning a party, you could have at least put me on the guest list."
"All right, who's going to tell me what's going on?"
- It's best if you don't know.
- Best if I don't know what?
Telling you would kind of defeat the purpose of 'it's best if you don't know'.
"Okay, you two have been skulking around the city for two days."
I want to know what's going on.
I can't believe neither of them would tell me what was going on!
This is a little hard to picture.
Mike and Henry are hanging out..
"No, not just hanging out, they're working together."
They're investigating that fashion model murder.
You know what drives me crazy?
They didn't even want me involved.
"They didn't want my help, nothing."
"Yeah, there's nothing worse than when you find out somebody close to you doesn't trust you."
"It's not the same thing, Coreen."
Of course not.
"The killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control the gunrunning business in London."""
Where are you from again?
Hampshire CID.
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allowed Jacob Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for certain strategic reasons is information you might want to lose from your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Well, I must admit, talking to yourself and others, it seems your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner not Simmonds.
Have you seen that film?
What film?
The Untouchables.
Great film.
It's a great film.
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"They put one of ours in a hospital, we put one of theirs in a morgue."
- Right
- Iain...
A green light's on in the car like a little green exclamation mark.
Probably needs a service.
It's brand new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
Do you want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
So what's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
Mrs. hall!
Go on to your basket now.
"Oh, I'm disgusted with you."
Go on.
Mrs. hall!
"- I heard you the first time, Mr. farnon."
How did he get out?
I've asked you to keep the gate shut.
"Aye, you have."
- He nearly ended up under the wheels of my car.
"While the hole stays in fence, dogs will stray-- the hole?"
!
- So either you or Mr. Tristan must mend it.
"Till then, you've got nothing you can complain about, have you?"
Tristan...
You almost left it too late.
"Stick that round his neck, would you, please?"
He was running with that bunch at far field.
I had no idea it had gotten to this state.
"Wooden tongue, is it?"
"Yes, that's right-- actinobacillosis, to be absolutely accurate."
"It you don't catch it in time, the tongue hardens, and they starve to death."
"Can you do aught for him, you reckon?"
"Mmm, fortunately."
"There's a new treatment, Mr. Abbot-- sodium iodide."
It's a vast improvement on the old system-- painting the tongue with iodine.
Hello.
What do you want?
"Come to keep an eye on things, haven't you, lass?"
It's vital you get some nourishment into him.
Milk or gruel will do until the injection starts to work.
"If he'll drink it, that'll do him the most good."
And my adventures in this life won't mean anything... because you will have seduced my soul... and drawn me into your world.
"Goodbye, Tom."
Has his weight been varying much here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
"All right, Tom."
Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
"I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn."
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
"If this thing works the way I designed it... you should fall absolutely straight, stop, and make a half-turn to the right."
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
"Christ, you ain't going to drown me, are you?"
No.
You just step onto the platform... and your weight will activate a water valve... that finally springs the trap.
"All right, step back inside."
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
"You suppose that's what I've been doing all these years, Sam?"
"Don't ask me that, Tom."
Bring the scales.
"Come on, Mr. Julian."
Oh.
"Ah, we're almost done, aren't we, cock?"
"See you, mate."
Yeah.
You know what my first act will be when I run this country?
Make threesomes compulsory?
OK.
But my second act will be to abolish five-day weather forecasts and publicly execute those who give them.
Some might say extreme.
"No, Sunday night, some guy who believes he has a personality 'cause he wears a bow tie says,"
"'It's galoshes day Monday, folks!"
'
Then this lunatic pretends to tell me the weather for the next five days.
Folks might find this useful in the planning of a week.
"Well, folks would be deceived, because by Tuesday night, bow tie has changed his forecast for two of the five nights but won't admit it."
"Your point being if it's a five-day weather forecast, how come he changes his mind every night?"
"Clearly, he can't, you know."
Kill him.
"Compassionately, but yes."
I'm sorry but um...
"What have you come as, eh?"
What's the emergency?
Where's hero-sorry-tax boy?
I just abandoned him at Parliament House.
It was unbearable.
They want him to run.
"Oh, God, strike at my vitals."
What am I doing?
This is mad.
I should go.
"Come on, I just hauled my arse halfway across town."
I'm sorry.
I've been expecting something from work.
You didn't get an envelope for me?
"No, babe, just that."
"I'll come down in five minutes, have the croissants with you guys."
"I'm Just gonna finish up with some emails, okay?"
Okay.
- 24 - LEGACY
Previosly on - 24 -
"Six months ago, u.S. Special forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization."
Decorated Army Ranger Eric Carter
Bin-khalid's people found us.
Where is it?
"A strongbox that belongs to sheik bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him."
- Carter?
"- We're blown, the whole team."
Grimes and I are the only ones left.
Former CTU Director Rebecca Ingram
"Three people had access - the directors of CIA,"
"NSA and CTU, which is now Keith Mullins."
You're the one who chose me as your replacement.
You need to trust me to do the job.
"Rebecca, what is this?"
IsRebeccahaving second thoughts about giving up her career?
- You're gonna make a great first lady.
Senator John Donovan
Maybe part of her doesn't want you to win and have everything change.
You're overstepping.
"I think Amira's gonna do something bad, violent here at the school."
- Drew saw our messages.
- What?
Amira Dudayev
The Baroness was his mistress once.
"It was said, yes."
"I am sure of it, but it is precisely to deprive me of this suspicion that Norbert maintained the evening."
"You must get out of the bath, Princess, or you will be late."
"No, little Nadine, wearing an opal bracelet is old fashioned."
I'll take this.
And this.
"This way, you look like the Holy Virgin."
I am neither one nor the other.
This syncopated melody which contrasts with the constant rythm of the drums is really exciting.
"To dance, perhaps, but it's not worth Mozart."
"Dear friend, one can love Mozart and jazz."
The only thing interesting you is religious music.
"Dear Mr Fandor, I devour your articles."
This Dollon case is very exciting.
So you like that much crime stories?
"Yes, when I do not live them."
"It's true, you have been visited by"
Fantômas in your bathtub a few years ago.
"Do not talk about it, especially tonight."
I hope that he will be hanged very soon.
"Dear princess, I think you should not provoke him."
Even in word.
To hell with him.
Do you believe in the devil?
His supreme skill is to convince people he doesn't exist.
- Sorry.
- You're hurt?
"Madam, I am confused."
Excuse me.
It is nothing at all.
I'll freshen up.
Are these the same X-rays?
"Jefferson, Jefferson Reed."
"Mary, would you give me the blood vial on this patient?"
"""Jefferson Reed."""
The patient's name is Jefferson Reed.
"Dr. Jones, you're needed immediately... in patient Jefferson Reed's room."
Cut the bandages away.
"Oh, my God."
Let me have a mirror.
This is how I always look.
What we have here is another case... of a patient being diagnosed improperly.
He was suffering from third-degree burns... but there isn't any scar tissue anywhere.
Any real doctor might assume that this is... a rare case of the Stromburg theory... where badly burned tissue has an adverse reaction... causing the tissue to heal.
- Wrong!
Wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
Wrong.
"The Stromburg theory states... that minor burns could heal under stress, not third-degree."
"Look in the book... page 294, 3rd paragraph, middle of the page."
- He's right.
- Thank you.
Dr. Jones wrong.
He don't know what he talkin' about.
You really should reread chapter fourteen.
Chapter fourteen?
"Please, tell us why."
"In chapter fourteen, he starts out talking about..."
What was I saying again?
"Thank you very much for your medical tips, Mr. Reed."
I just want to run a few more tests... and you may leave whenever you're ready.
"Oh, no, Mrs. Johnson."
"They just called me, and I..."
It's ugly.
It's loud.
It's always moving.
I never feel still long enough to hold a thought.
I feel sick out there among the people.
"I need to remedy this, and an opportunity has presented itself."
I'm gonna take it.
I've got no money and no hope of another advance.
I'm doing what's best for me.
"Yeah, you're doing what you're best at."
You're looking out for your own self interests without thinking about how it might affect me or anybody else.
Typical!
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.
"Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice that I'm alone all of a sudden."
Why can't you do something that involves me?
Why can't we go somewhere together?
"You know, alone or..."
Is it the money?
Because I don't mind if you need to borrow some again...
"Put your money away, all right?"
I'm not taking any money from you.
Those days are behind me.
"Forever, I told myself."
I hope this will be good for us.
But especially for me.
You are selfish and unsentimental.
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
On the contrary.
"An admirable trait, if you ask me."
I come from an unsupportive background.
"Thank you, sahib."
"- Hello, boy."
"- Hello, mate."
"You're alive, anyway."
What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
"So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter."
"Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop."
Where's the troop?
"There's no troop, and the Guru has us."
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
"I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!"
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame?
They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
"- You didn't tell them, did you?"
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero.
Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
"- Untie him, will you?"
- Yes.
Untie me.
I said untie him!
"Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!"
"You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you."
Use his.
Where is Alexander?
Are you stupid or what?
"There were problems, OK?"
- Why is he on the ground?
- He had this on him.
Why didn't you take him in?
- We wanted to talk to you first.
- Oh?
We were a bit hard on a pusher.
The one who supplies your son.
We broke his rib.
And you're judging the case.
Can I take my son home?
- Get in.
- What about my car?
I'll get it picked up.
If word ever gets out...
PARENTS
I am sure my father realizes perfectly well   that stuff happens that shouldn't.
I don't think he gives a shit.
To him what matters is that I get some qualifications   and when I am with him and his people -
- I play ball and behave the way he wants.
What matters to my parents is that you do something with your life.
They aren't that emotional.
They have no idea what we do at weekends   as long as we get good grades.
It's off their radar.
We haven't had the close family ties everyone else has.
Lousy attention is better than no attention.
Do I feel neglected?
My father has never been to watch me play football or anything.
Some of these parents are unable to help their children to straighten up.
"Now, what do I do with this?"
I'm going through this one
Time for Mr. Carrington to unleash his charm offensive.
"Why, hello, ladies."
"Good morning, sir."
"Mr. Carrington, is there anybody here that you are particularly fond of or have a preference for?"
"Yeah, there is very much somebody"
I'm specifically very close to and feel an enormous attachment to and that's Miss Hopkins.
"As Miss Hopkins' chaperone, it's Lady Devonport's job to keep impoverished playboys at arm's length."
"But having experienced the pitfalls of Regency propriety herself, she's in two minds."
"And as you know,"
I support your interest in her completely.
So next!
No.
How do you propose to support Miss Hopkins?
"Um, with my massive amounts of charm and talent and no money."
And so modest.
"As the chaperones debate the charms of Mr. Carrington,"
"Mr. Everett soldiers on with his maze, helped by old friend Miss Braund."
And then this one here...
So what's this rounded one here?
"When Mr. Everett comes in,"
I know that he's going to...
"Yeah, I agree."
"In fact, either of them are perfectly wonderful."
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, morning."
Do sit down.
Thank you so much.
"The first question is, is there a particular lady here that you like?"
I like Miss Hopkins.
The questions that Professor Rahmi gave me for photocopying...
- Did you look at them?
"- Well, I did this time."
"So, you were just going to help yourself?"
"I couldn't say it, okay?"
I couldn't say it.
"Whatever, it doesn't matter."
Let's not talk about that now.
You are the only guy who's organized systematic on the clock.
"And we need you on this issue, okay?"
"Okay, but I'll only do the planning."
"I won't interfere with the rest, deal?"
Fine.
Are we going to rob Professor Fatma?
No way.
It's fine with me.
"You're the ones who are having difficulty in math, not me."
But it's the most problematic one for all of us.
I think it's ideal for a start.
"Sure, I think so too."
She irritates me anyway.
Let's just start from there.
How are we going to do this?
She was telling us to draw a trapezoid.
"Now, we'll make the best one."
Listen to me.
We'll steal the questions a day before the test.
"Professor Fatma has a bag with a code, right?"
She keeps all her files and grading books in that bag.
"The day before the test, our questions will be in that bag."
How are we going to find the password?
The code is with two digits.
"- Me, too."
Where's Riley?
Let's be honest with each other.
Charlestown needs a makeover.
"It's time to look toward the future, folks."
And the first step toward that future is the Frazier Point Golf Community Country Club and Spa.
Two hundred luxurious new homes!
- Thirty-six holes and...
- Twenty-five orphans without a home.
Who let him in?
Anyone?
He works for me.
I thought he should hear what you have planned for his home.
- Of course.
"- By all means, please continue."
"Yes, do."
"To survive hard times like these, we all have to make sacrifices."
Those making the biggest sacrifices are the boys at Newman.
"But we could use a Wii in every room, or some new dirt bikes, or even a year's supply of Lucky Charms, but other than that we're fine, thanks."
Is that so?
"Hope, the report please."
Rats in the soup pot.
Girlie magazines.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes."
"My dream is simple, folks."
"I want to help the orphans and create a new Charlestown full of life, energy and growth potential."
Help us?
By destroying the only family we've ever known?
"By shipping us off to dangerous big-city homes where kids have tattoos, piercings, and, God forbid, Facebook?"
"City Council, ask yourselves this."
Is a round of golf really worth an orphan's happiness?
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal."
They were fake.
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those...kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
Coffee?
"Thank you, yes."
Right now I'm waiting for Lt. Anderson.
I thought he ought to know about a call I got yesterday afternoon from this man Somers who was murdered.
Mind letting me know about that call?
I represent Axel Norstaad.
Norstaad?
Small world.
Somers wanted me to be ready to file an injunction this morning restraining a man named Norstaad from any future acts of violence and/or interference.
And also to put a private detective on the trail of one Latham Reed.
"I didn't take the case, though."
Too busy.
Who's Reed?
"Some building contractor that Somers said may have made off with a certified check for $50,000."
"When, do you know?"
Yesterday afternoon.
"Oh, there's Anderson now."
If you'll excuse me.
Certainly nice to have seen you both.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
[door closes]
[Axel] No.
It cannot be that you have not heard from her in all this time.
You must tell me where--
Have I interrupted you?
"Please, Mr. Mason."
Why do you not leave like I tell you?
"Well, it seemed obvious you didn't want to talk in front of Lt. Anderson."
But I do not need you.
"Axel, what happened between you and Somers yesterday that caused him instruct his attorney to file an injunction against you?"
"Oh, that."
You disappeared for a few days again and didn't even call.
What was I to do?
Who am I to you?
An empty place?
I'm sitting here in depression and you're waiting for me to serve to you!
Great King!
People who love you caught criminals!
"The people are waiting for you judgement, Solomon!"
Who are these people?
"They are your enemies, great King."
They have destroyed the new sacrifial altar that you built.
In darkness the earth trembles.
I said to them:
"""Gods, sons of the Lord!"
"You're gods but you live like humans and will fall like all the kings."""
The King has ruled to execute the criminals.
Execute them!
"You are the one who should be judged, Solomon!"
Let this execution be a lesson to everyone who dares go against the works of the great King Solomon!
Let justice be done!
It is easy to kill with other people's hands.
"Remember your fear, Solomon."
It will become your sentence.
Solomon!
Our blood is your vanity.
Today you will see us and tomorrow we will see you.
I think they deserve your mercy.
They are enemies of the state.
They believe in you.
And you make them believe in a sin.
I may forgive my enemies but not the enemies of the state.
Turn to the bureaucrats we know.
"I tell you, I will not fall for you!"
You deserve to be put behind bars.
You deserve to die in jail!
You are too bad!
"I tell you, you jinx!"
Serve you right!
Quiet
"Your Honour,"
I've proved that his motive is doubtful...
"Your Honour, the accused's look doesn't make sense with killing."
"By the way, the..."
Wait!
"You should wait, by the way..."
Listen to me first.
"Even he wanted to kill Chun, he would go some place else."
It's senseless to kill in the place where he is working.
What do you think the cause of Chun's death?
"I don't know, you'd better think!"
"Maybe, Ho Chun wanted to rape Foon."
But he failed.
So he committed suicide and made Foon be the scapegoat.
"Chan Mon-gut, this is the British court, not the poor court of you Chinese."
I don't know what you are doing here.
You don't know anything about law.
Please go back to study more.
"Even you don't think of your own reputation, you'd think of the face of your fellow people."
Sorry...
He always mentions the United Kingdom.
It seems he's forgotten that Hong Kong was leased to the UK.
They have to return it one day!
"Damn it, how dare he be that cocky in our territory!"
?
The investigation is ongoing.
Ussing's affairs are being checked.
I'm siding with Ussing.
I hope you understand.
"The public prosecutor was reluctant, but Ussing insisted strongly."
Step down of your own accord or we'll have to withdraw our support.
We're looking for someone who may have been close to Louise.
- She only had us.
- Did anyone else see her that day?
One of your colleagues called to ask about the same things an hour ago.
"Why would the perpetrator use your name, if he doesn't know you?"
- Was Special Branch involved in this?
- I wasn't involved in that case.
- Why don't you believe me?
- What are you talking about?
You shut everyone out.
"Me, us, your son."
No one's allowed into your life.
Her bike got broken that morning.
I think that's why she got a lift.
There was a man in a black car.
Those are all his notebooks.
He's crazy about car registrations.
- Where does that road lead?
- To a closed boat builder's yard.
That looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.
This is where she was taken.
Borch took the boy's book with license plate numbers this morning.
It was you and Special Branch who erased everything about the black car.
- I'm not discussing this.
- Why is that book important?
THE KILLING Ill
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please let me go.
I don't want to die here.
Please.
Please let me go.

JERRY:
Toast just did a sweep of Addison's laptop.
Found something the crime lab missed.
Spyware.
And she had it bad.
"I'm not talking about the kind that slows your computer down, and gives you pop-up ads for boner pills."
I'm talking about Cherry Bomb.
"What's ""Cherry Bomb?"""
It's like Microsoft Office for black hat hackers.
"It's a suite of malware that includes key loggers, root kits, and fingerprint evasions"
Real scary stuff.
"The thing is, we found the executable file that infected Addison's system."
It was installed over five months ago.
"So the spyware landed on her computer before she was catfished by Mintz, which means that it had to be her kidnapper who infected her."
"We find out who's behind the hack, we found our guy."
"Okay, guys,"
"I don't know who attacked Addison's computer, but I might know someone who does."
(hip-hop music playing loudly through car speakers)
"Dude, what are you doing?"
Just keeping it real.
I don't want the old crew thinking I sold out.
Why do you think we parked two blocks away?
DANNY:
I can't believe this.
(EXHALES)
(DOOR OPENS)
- Hey.
- I know you.
Do you know where he is?
I don't.
"Do you, like, live here now?"
I still have the keys.
"No, now I live in a depressing faculty apartment."
How is the college?
It's fine.
I assumed he'd be here.
- Seems I was mistaken.
"- Yeah, that makes two of us."
"Hey, you can stay if you want to."
That won't be necessary.
"NARRATOR: 'For reasons unclear to him, 'the exchange with Melanie caused overwhelming anxiety in Philip, 'who had driven through the night to get here."
"'In the weeks he had spent living with Ike, when Melanie was not around, 'she was never brought up in conversation."
"'Philip would have forgotten about her, 'had it not been for the smattering of photographs 'that still remained in the guest room where he slept."
"'Sitting meekly on the couch,"
'Melanie embodied the high cost of isolation and detachment from loved ones.
"'Unable to stand it any longer,"
'Philip excused himself and returned to his pitiful life at the college.'
Tell him I was here.
Your little protégé stopped by yesterday.
"He's not a protégé, he's a..."
He's a friend.
I still haven't read his book.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
My copy is in the city.
Should I read it?
"Well, it is remarkable."
Uncle Kwai likes you
"Honestly, here it's better than in those wooden huts"
What are you thinking about?
I'm an illegal immigrant I still owe people a large sum of money I've told Uncle Kwai before
He said he can give you $300 a month to pay your debt and another $200 as pocket money ls that enough?
Yes...
What if there are no children after the debt is paid?
I have no problem with that
But I don't know about him...
Then the three hundred dollars are for you
Five hundred dollars in total per month ls that correct?
Then you don't have to think about it anymore
Just stay here tonight to save yourself money and efforts youneedn'tworryaboutgettingyouridchecked  impossible
Why?
"Uncle Kwai, this bed is so small"
How can two people sleep in it?
Small?
I've got an idea
This should do it
That's good enough
A carpenter is well-equipped
Finish working?
"Wow, it's a colour TV"
I never thought I'd marry such a good wife
is he any good?
"His right hook is powerful, don't worry"
Get up
is it alright?
"One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten"
Now we invite the H'nble Chairman of Free Fighting...
Association Mr. Chan Chi Chuen to present the prizes
Mr. Chan Chi Chuen please
"You see something,abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean,it's tragic,but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a tv set?
It says it all.
"Well,it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
- Still got my eyebrows.
- Good point.
"I found finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he s probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
After being undergroun it's unlikely.
"Strange case,huh?"
I had th friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an nea grant... - abby.
"Um,next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Thing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
I sent the acidity levels to ducky.
I then inventoried finn's personal items.
- Got anything with a date on it?
- Nope.Sorry.
If the key was already in the keyhole... then how did your fingerprints... get on the middle barrel of the key?
"I mean, if you had only turned the key, like you just said... then your fingerprints wouldn't be there, right?"
The fact of the matter is... when you broke the pane and put your hand in... the key was already in your hand.
I...
I didn't do...
"Natasha Malhotra, you are hereby arrested on the charges of murder of..."
Don't even think about it.
Kabir?
No.
Lqbal Chand Malhotra.
The mastermind of this game.
That's right.
Place your pistol on the table.
Out.
"You too, Mr. Menon."
"If I had a pistol, you wouldn't have been alive right now."
"In that case, thank you for not carrying a gun."
Natasha.
Her gun.
"May I ask you something, Mr. Menon?"
When did you piece the puzzle together?
At the hospital.
If I hadn't seen the photograph...
I wouldn't have known that you and Kabir were identical twins.
"And they say, twins... don't give birth to twins."
"It's over, Malhotra."
Game over.
It's your game that is over.
Coming here alone was a huge mistake.
Natasha... go and wait for me on the boat.
Some things aren't meant to be done in the presence of children.
It could corrupt their minds.
Wait.
"Look, they only had a few seconds."
It wasn't enough time to get an exact location.
We're fine for a little while.
Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient in our medical unit to expect a significant skirmish between two towns in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
What is the location of those towns?
"CZ-12, Quadrant Four."
We've tracked the terror suspect to within 200 miles of that area.
Capture of this suspect is a top priority for President Tomarchio and the administration.
Do you understand?
"Should I re-prioritize, sir?"
Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
"Once the area's clear, we will begin our search for the terrorists"
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
She can't cook;
she's never seen nine innings of baseball in her life;
she hates my clothes... but I love her.
And I'm happy.
"Jake, I don't want to die today."
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Hawkins!
That's all.
Mandrian and I were together.
The first thing I knew was when I came out into the corridor and saw Rafford.
And you?
I am called Levett.
Did you see or hear anything?
I was asleep in my quarters.
Would anybody else have seen you there?
- Why should anyone else bother?
"- All right, there's no need for that."
"There are worse things than being alone, Sonheim."
Being with you is one of them
"We're getting away from the point a little, aren't we?"
You were all knocked out by Sonovapour.
"At some time in the last 12 hours, your pilot was murdered."
"And since you're the only people here on board, then I presume..."
"No, we're not."
Dortmunn isn't here.
- Who is Dortmunn?
- Flight engineer.
"Well, where is he?"
"I want him found, Mandrian."
Search the whole ship.
He's got to be here somewhere.
"Sonheim, Levett."
Whilst your people look for him I'll go and see how my people are getting on.
They're on the flight deck assessing the damage.
Will you come with me?
Right.
"Well, there's nothing I can do with that, it'll have to be replaced."
What's the situation?
"We can fit some of it back together, but there are a lot of components that will have to be replaced."
"Not modern, just something better, we're not so poor we can't afford it."
We paid for it and what happened?
Did I need a dance for that?
It was all your fault.
is this how one imagines life will be?
is this what you prepared for us?
"You invited me, so I went."
"We did, but what are you telling me!"
Then where am I to go with you?
It wasn't the expense I minded.
Should I go to the cemetery with you?
That won't cost anything.
And you can be sad there!
And you can be quiet there.
It'd be just the right place for you.
"All my youth, with you..."
What did I get from it?
Youth!
Did you think you'd always be young?
When did I have a good time?
When did I go to a party?
When could I afford anything?
I came from Prague during the Protectorate.
First I went to school and then...
You could add that first you were born.
Let's begin at the beginning.
"Go on, say it was a pity we went there."
So we were there.
That was all we experienced and then it was over.
Nineteen fifty-three came and we went broke.
"But you kept saying, it'll be all right..."
"You philosophized, speculated, until you overdid it and lost all."
What are you drinking?
Water.
Seriously?
"If it was a joke, would it be funny?"
"No, no, I mean, to each his own."
We interrupt this game to bring you this breaking news story right now.
"Jim O'Bannon, host of The O'Bannon files, a sometimes controversial news and opinion show viewed by millions, was found dead just minutes ago outside a downtown restaurant."
At this time...
Barkeep.
...police tell us that apparently he was shot to death at close range alongside two of his bodyguards.
Jim O'Bannon was 58.
We now return you back to the game.
"So Jim O'Bannon, huh?"
"That's kind of crazy, him getting killed."
"Him being a big TV star and all, don't you think?"
Fame doesn't make you invincible.
"Yeah, and I always thought he was a bit of a jackass, but nobody deserves to die, you know."
I'm Allan.
How you doing?
"What is this, some kind of fag bar?"
"No, I was just..."
I'm sorry.
"I was just trying to make some friendly conversation, that's all."
"It's like I got ""Everlast"" stamped across my face, man."
Like a human punching bag.
"Can I have another one, please?"
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
"Whatever, man."
It's cool.
"When I spoke to you earlier,"
I must have given off the impression that I was game for conversation.
One second!
What are you doing here?
"We're tutoring them, it's all completely legal!"
Where... did the previous tenants go?
I came here two weeks ago.
And I don't know the previous tenants.
"Oh, Tae Ho!"
Why are you coming out of that room?
Did you get them mixed up?
What are you talking about?
That room was just storage space for our equipment.
Since we had a lot of communications equipment...
"And because the rent was so expensive we sent the equipment to the head office, and let the room go up for rent."
How does that make any sense?
"There were two men, and this woman, both of whom you work with, in that room!"
The two men!
Where are they?
We didn't come here to play.
We are here because of a murder!
And I know you ordered them to do all of this!
You?
So this is how you're going to be?
- Jung In!
- Yes?
Have you ever been to room 866?
No.
"See, Tae Ho?"
What reason would we have to hire two more male employees?
When all we have to do is gather the agents whenever they showed up!
I know your job is to trick people.
"But try to do it in moderation, okay?"
"I'm telling you that I saw them, very clearly, with my own eyes."
really?
"well, you know that wink's gonna die, and you're gonna get promoted."
- i can't believe wink never promoted me.
he promised.
"baby, he promised."
- what a loser!
"you know, i thought, of all the losers in all the different trailer parks, that wayne was gonna be different."
"- he would've been, too, but behind every great man is a great woman."
- are you saying i ain't a great woman?
- you think it was better for him to buy you a harley than to go to college?
- it was for me.
"- oh, look around."
you really think that this was better for you in the long run?
- let me guess -- that's me in the box.
i ain't afraid of dying.
- look around.
funeral parlor's pretty empty.
- so?
it's not like i'd be around to care.
"though, actually, i did think wayne might be here."
he was pretty good about obligations.
- wayne died a year ago.
saw a commercial for i.t.t. technical college and began crying so hard his throat done closed up and couldn't get no more air.
strange occurrence.
suffocated to death.
- hmm.
see?
look.
somebody loves me.
here comes bob.
"he's always good about obligations, too."
"- i have laid awake many a night, thinking to myself,"
To commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there.
Both of you.
Is that a program?
Yeah. and smile.
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.
Way ahead of you.
This graduation is a celebration for us too.
No more mean girls.
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.
"Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom."
J. wanna throw your hat in the ring?
What are you talking about?
Queen. what else is there to talk about?
The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year?
What would high school be without hierarchy?
Bearable?
a nice place to spend time?
Ladies.
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.
- What's going on?
- your minions were just telling me
About the search for the next queen.
They don't get to choose the next queen. i do.
"And take off that hideous scarf, penelope."
You can see if from space.
Not so fast j. don't waste your time appealing to blair.
We don't listen to her anymore.
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold
Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.
The new girl emma boardman transferring in next year.
Nice to meet you little j.
Silence!
I made a program for you and you decided not to follow it.
You defied my instructions and you went off course.
"Why are we being held to a different standard, Marcel?"
You weren't here on time this morning.
"I was here before sunrise, sadly, by myself."
"Therefore, I chose not to wait."
"Marcel, I've got to be honest with you."
You know...
Silence!
"No, you silence!"
"Please, just..."
"I don't need some speech about moments, okay?"
"No more, okay?"
"I'm sorry that we kept you waiting this morning and that we didn't respect your program, but last night my wife and I, we spent some real time together, and for the first time in a long time,"
"we woke up actually very, very happy."
"So, with all due respect, sir,"
"I don't need you, or anyone else for that matter, to, you know, say anything, really."
I know.
Sorry?
You do?
Yes.
That is why I am giving you this.
I don't understand.
I could never reveal your true inner animal spirit.
It was always up to you.
"Cynthia, Jason, your spirit is the rabbit."
"No matter what obstacles are put in front of him, the rabbit will scrape and burrow and find a way to create his home."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Lucy, Joseph."
"For you, the wolf."
I have traveled to China on a merchant ship once.
Would you like to work as a navigator of our group?
"Yes, I will do my best if you'll hire me."
Same here.
I will build a brewery in Chunghae.
I need men to work at the brewery.
- Select the workers.
"- Yes, sir."
"If you work hard, you will be fed well and make money."
But I hate lazy men.
You will be fired the moment I catch you slacking off.
Hire the rest of them as our workers.
"Yes, sir."
We need to start trading in order to create more jobs.
And we need to wipe out the pirates in order to do that.
It will take more time to wipe out Yum Moon and the remaining pirates.
Grand Chief.
What is it?
The leader of the Palmi pirates has surrendered with his men.
My name is Pil-ryul.
We heard you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us into your care.
- You know Yum Moon?
- Yes.
Where is he?
I don't know where he is.
How could we trust them?
We can't show you our true mind.
We can't also make you trust us.
But we risked our lives to leave the base.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
"Oh, you're never like me, dear Elinor."
Look how calmly you take the news.
He opened his heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
"It came out quite unawares, quite without design."
I could talk of nothing but my child.
"He gave way to his feelings and he told me of his earnest, tender, constant affection for Marianne."
Everybody knows Colonel Brandon to be an excellent man.
Excellent?
"Oh, my dear, he remained constant throughout that business with Willoughby and he brought me here."
- Any man might do as much for love.
"- Oh, Elinor, do you now belittle him?"
On the contrary!
I am saying that what makes him so fine a gentleman is his constant goodness to everybody.
I have offered heartfelt thanks for all he has done.
"Oh, thanks are not enough."
One must help good causes along.
I have told him that Marianne will be well enough to see him tomorrow.
Whose idea was this?
"Mother's, I suppose."
You must thank him.
I mean to.
He is a worthy man.
"But worthy men are so uninteresting, especially men of his age."
And letting him see me in this state...
- You look lovely.
- My skin looks terrible.
"You are romantically pale, like the heroine of one of Mrs Radcliffe's novels."
"- Hmm, yes."
I see what you mean.
- (LAUGHS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Good morning, Colonel."
It was recently brought to my attention that I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
Honest question.
Do you think I'm a cynic?
Honest answer?
Absolutely.
You're Miss Possible But Not Likely.
About my own life?
Of course.
"But watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?"
"I mean, look at them."
Have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
Not in a while.
"Amanda, you said we need to talk."
Right.
You didn't think I meant-
Maybe a little.
After a few people weighed in.
The one time you didn't take my words literally.
Did you really think my feelings had changed?
Is that why you brought me here?
"I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you."
But no one was actually asking you.
That's why my feelings for you could never change.
Didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
Only for you.
You have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom- Save your excuses!
Your flight leaves in less than two hours.
My flight- You heard me.
But you haven't heard her.
You have nothing to say in the matter!
But I do!
I am sure that all this is very risky for our organization.
"Well then, we have to get ready for the meeting, we do not have much time."
Follow them!
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one, respond unit one."
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one,attention unit one,"
"Unit one, go ahead."
"You are being tailed by a car,You are being tailed by a car!"
Understood.
"Quickly, accelerate, we must loose them!"
"Ok then, go take a break, I will let you know if we have another test."
"Miss Diana, one moment, I must speak with you."
"Yes, Madame"
"Attention, attention, this is Lucrecia reporting, we have Adriana, you may pick her up."
"Yes, Madame?"
"Do not be frightened, Miss, you are only going to serve as company, to your friend Dinamo."
We do not want any risks.
"It is best for you to not resist, dear."
"Freeze or I shoot, darling."
Take her.
"I will take care of her later, personally."
Kill him!
I will.
Watch out!
"Are you ok, Dinamo?"
"I am, Inspector, this is bigger than you can imagine."
We are facing an S.O.S. cell.
S.O.S.?
Secret Organisational Service.
What are they looking for here?
"I do not know, Inspector, but we must not waste time."
"Have your men sorround the hotel and wait there, to await my signal."
May I use one of your motors?
"You were planning to recover the case for yourself,eh."
"Thanks,you have managed to show me where it is, my men will find it."
It is not the case that we seek.
"I don't know where it is, it fell to the bottom."
You won't get to see it.
Hold it!
Have you ever killed in cold blood?
"Go ahead, what are you waiting for?"
"Andres, no!"
Andres!
Andres!
Oh no!
The End?
Subtitled by Jose Jimenez 12/22/2011
"Nice landing, Uncle Bene."
Right on the 50-yard line.
Should've gone for a touchdown.
"Next time, I'll put it right between the goalposts."
Can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.
That's why we arranged this little vacation.
We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain that you two haven't had an opportunity to see what life in the big city is all about.
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.
There'll be another time for that.
"Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun."
- It's locked.
- Tia?
"Tony, come back here."
"Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary."
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
"That's class, eh?"
Not even lost her appetite!
"The best for you, my gem."
My black gem.
I'm not a black gem.
I live like my mom did.
"In expensive clothes, in luxury, in flesh, without pleasure."
"But it would be good to find somebody that loves me, a husband, just like in real life."
"The Venom family, you know there are four of them?"
I'll make Ancient Mariners out of them.
Impressed?
Me no high school!
A black gem in the hollow of dunes.
"Cold Venom for the vultures, and a gold toothpick for my father."
That's the lineup!
Now paint the town red!
Shift asses!
Shake heads!
Hey you!
"You don't care about turning up late to my engagement, making wallpaper out of my bro?"
"Sure Martine, you're pushing it!"
"Listen, I was in pain!"
Everyone has monthlies once a month!
"- Come on, eat, drink!"
You got here at 9 like everyone else!
- You're too rough handling her!
"Hey baby bro, feet too busy spinning in your oatmeal?"
"A cheap, pathetic fuck, that's tops for you lot!"
"Princesses for Princes, and trailertrash for flunkies."
You'll never get beyond that!
"That's not about you, Prince."
"If I hadn't used my brains to work my ass off for six months, we would never have pulled the job off."
Do you have a nice place to write?
"I mean, that's important."
"You'll find that, if you haven't already."
I rented a small studio.
Does it work for you?
"No, not really."
"In fact, I rarely go."
Here.
"I probably wouldn't have wanted to hear this either when I was your age, but..."
The city.
You can't get anything done here.
"It has a creative energy, but not a productive energy."
"Quiet does not exist, and I find that difficult."
"Do you know, I've not written a single page within the city limits these past 30 years?"
"You'll need a country retreat, if you can afford one."
I can't.
(CHUCKLES)
Well...
"Of course, I had achieved considerably more than you by now."
- Not to be insulting.
- Of course.
"But if I can be of any assistance, if I can help in any way, just ask outright."
Don't be shy.
I loved your book.
"- Yeah, it was OK."
- Don't denigrate yourself.
"It's really, really good, and it would be a shame for me not to read another one."
Hello.
(♪ UPBEAT LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING)
"It's a filthy system, the way it's structured."
You can trust me on this.
I'm not sorry if this kills any of your illusions about anything.
"Warm regards, nigga."
"O.G. Stinkmeaner."""
"By the way, you're not exactly the same as the original."
There were some enhancements.
"Hey, kids, welcome to the nigga moment reboot!"
This is where we're gonna do some shit we already did and just pretend you didn't see that shit the first time!
"That's right, nigga!"
We don't respect your intelligence!
"Hey, and welcome to ""Cooking with Stink!"""
"We're whipping up a nigga moment today, and here's what you'll need to make one at home!"
"First, you'll need two black men, age 5 to 122."
You can find these pretty much everywhere!
I've got two right here!
Then add one minor incident.
"Could be an errant look, incidental contact."
I prefer the classic shoe step myself.
After that you just need 25 years of
"The movie ""Scarf ace,"" which teaches irrational thinking."
Don't forget to stir in the crack!
And mwah!
Voil?
Delicioso!
"The best thing about nigga moments is, they never stop!"
"Every day for niggas is like ""groundhog day""!"
"Yeah, nigga!"
I hit your car just 'cause I wanted to!
I didn't even want to park in that space!
I just wanted to fuck your car up and then wait here to tell you I did it!
- What you gonna do?
!
- No!
- Two old dudes about to fight!
You know he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Doctor Jones.
Die herr in the bar Möchten mit ihnen Sprechen.
Kommen Sie bitte mit uns.
You're looking for me?
"Ha, ha ,ha.."
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other,"
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It wasn't I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.
Yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
"She was very nice, your girl."
"Yes, she is."
She's very nice.
"So like I said, I just want to cross a couple of T's, little stuff."
It's all just part of the process.
"By the way, sir, I was real impressed with your graciousness..."
- on the whole Senator Hanson thing.
- Oh?
"You know, in supporting her."
Real gracious.
"Well, as you know, I withdrew my name from consideration."
Right.
Right.
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.
How long have you known her?
"- Oh, well, actually, I don't really..."
- I'm sorry.
"When you said, ""Anybody that knows her""..."
- I know people who know her.
- Uh-huh.
"- I'm happy to give you their names, if you'd like."
- Great.
"I don't really know her, but I've seen her several times at functions... and, uh, I think she'll do a real good job."
"Sir, can I just say that..."
I was really hoping you'd go for the position... especially after what happened on the Apachaway.
"I think people would think, in the back of their minds..."
"""This here's a guy who takes risks when the right thing's at stake."""
- Lifesaver?
"- No, thanks."
"Anyway, some real bad luck, your being right there."
Not if I'd been able to save her.
"If Atlantis was real, it would mean rewriting the history books."
"I thought that was an archaeologist's job, to rewrite history."
I guess some people are frightened of change.
Yes?
MacGyver and Miss Carson have arrived.
They're about to open the Ark.
Good.
You know what to do.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
The words on the medallion and the Ark are identical.
Coincidence.
You can't expect us to believe these two artifacts are in any way connected.
"""The gods march in rank,"
"""and Hecate races in the heavens."
"""Enter the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages--"""
"""And the Treasure of Atlantis shall rise."""
"I've seen this riddle in the caves at Exeter, carved on an altar by the Cult of Solon."
So the gods are these figures on the side here?
Yes.
"Hermes, Aphrodite, Gaea, Selene,"
"Ares, Zeus and Cronus."
"This little guy on top, um, how do you pronounce it?"
Hecate.
Demon of the night.
"According to ancient legend, she was an omen of disaster and death."
I'm convinced that these are really instructions written by Solon to help find the Treasure of Atlantis.
Addle-minded bunk.
"The legend of Atlantis is just that, a legend."
I can prove it existed.
Sex with a human. it's beneath us.
- I feel dirty by association.
- No of fence taken.
"You know, if it had been one slip ..."
But it's turned into a full-blown affair.
He has feelings for her.
Found these in his desk.
They're from her.
They've been writing to each other for months.
- On paper?
- It has to stop.
"I'd kill the girl myself, but we Light Fae really are supposed to frown on harming humans."
"How generous of you, Olivia."
But you're unaffiliated.
It would be so nice and uncomplicated for you to get rid of her.
What are your rates for exterminating?
"It wasn't a coincidence that I ended up in bed with you, was it?"
I chose you because of the job.
My taste of you has convinced me you're strong enough.
"Well, problem, Liv, is that I'm not an assassin."
"One touch, and she's six feet under."
And you're for hire.
What's the issue?
"Oh, you know, how killing someone is wrong."
You're not hearing me.
I'm not gonna snuff out a life because it clashes with your drapes.
Fine.
"Screw the complications, I will take care of this myself."
We should probably find this Jenny.
And save her from a jealous Fury.
Yeah.
- So where do we find her?
[Tires screech]
[Train whistle blares]
What else did she tell you about this cat?
Anything?
"Just that Adalind brought it in, and it scratched her."
And she wouldn't believe anything I said about Adalind.
That's why I brought her to the trailer.
That's why I brought her to you.
"Okay, I get it."
"But I got to tell you, it was a little on the short side for a warning."
- When did she get scratched?
- Today.
"Look, Nick, I know you're hoping the doctors are going to be able to do something for her, but you saw what happened to Hank, you saw what happened to your sergeant."
"We got to get our hands on that cat, man."
- Detective Burkhardt?
- Yeah?
We have her stabilized.
"If this is an infectious disease, she'll need to stay quarantined."
"Normally, cat scratches are not that dangerous, so there may be something else going on here."
The tests are going to take quite a while to run.
There's nothing more you can do right now.
I suggest you go home.
"As soon as we know something, we'll call you."
"Look, Nick,"
I know you want to stay here and be with Juliette.
I do.
But that's not going to help.
Let's find that cat.
All right.
[Cell phone rings]
- Yeah.
- Nick.
"That big, stupid--"
It was my shop!
My office!
Who do you think everyone was looking to for running things?
Me.
Lisa Pedersen.
But I paid Mr.-
- Mr. Somers nothing.
Who else did you tell about those bids?
Who else could have had private dealings with Somers?
I don't understand.
I don't remember.
"Lisa, do you recall correspondence with a certain shoe company in Chicago?"
A company interested in obtaining a large building site?
A company who had written concerning the property occupied by Axel's cabinet shop?
"Oh, that."
I-
- I threw that in the wastebasket.
"Yet that company still expected to obtain the property, just as they'd already obtained the land next to it, the land once slated for Axel's Hospital?"
"Now think hard, Lisa."
Who else did you tell about the bids?
"It must have been a man who dealt with Somers, since he obviously knew what Somers had planned."
"It must have been a man who, on the night of the murder, told Axel where to find Somers."
"Now, it must have been--"
[Lisa] Yes.
"Yes, I told him."
Somers was a crook.
And out-and-out crook.
"Oh, yes, I knew it."
And what he was up to-- everything.
I paid him to tell me.
In return I was to have an option on the property he never intended to use anyway.
Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
"You okay in there, bestie?"
I'm fine...
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness;
the inability to pass uri...
"Yeah, I said I'm fine."
Stop talking to me.
She always this crabby when she urinates?
We're really not that close.
Screw it.
I'll go later.
And I'll be right by your side.
Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
"Oh, that's nice."
"No, it's not."
It's a strategic maneuver.
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group.
That bitch is crafty.
- You think?
- Of course.
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?
By going after its weakest member.
"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
"Okay, Amy, you're being silly."
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.
And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.
"Ooh, these are cute."
"Of course if I buy them,"
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
It doesn't matter.
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"- No argument, Lenny."
- And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3,000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor if you don't transport their employees BankExchange will dump this deal and forget about New York and put up their 60-story building in New Jersey instead."
So be it.
"The mayor loves BankExchange, but can't afford infrastructure."
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp it can't pay for them.
- Where are you going?
- I have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
Follow me.
Take a seat.
- I'm DS...
- Tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
"As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott."
DC Fleming.
"Mr Fairbank, we'd like to begin by asking you about a social worker who went missing in October '98, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd."
Doesn't ring a bell.
"If we may, sir, perhaps this report might jog your memory."
Blind as a bat without these.
Are you sure you don't want a tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
Sorry.
The report was copied to you.
"I mean, is there any reason you might take an interest?"
None at all.
Can you explain why you'd be sent this report?
"Well, I don't remember any of this."
"I mean, you're going back a good many years."
"We'd like to show you some newspaper clippings, if we may."
You appear to be quite close to Councillor Dale Roach.
Our paths crossed occasionally.
Usually at a charity event.
We weren't close.
"Well, we're looking into allegations of child sexual exploitation involving Councillor Roach."
"As head of Vice, did you ever deal with any complaints against Roach?"
"Well, there may have been some such saying,"
"""Councillor Roach has done this,"" or, ""Councillor Roach did that."""
And what would it be that the councillor did?
Especially you after you get your cut.
"What, I'm not entitled?"
I assume all the risk.
It's business.
You know how many bodies I see come through my hospital mortuary each week?
/ No.
Accident victims.
"Kids with healthy, beautiful transplantable organs at their loved ones won't sign a consent to donate."
That's their choice.
You wouldn't be saying that if it was your mother.
"Or your wife, or your child that were dying."
"You know, you'd be begging for my phone number."
"Well, your number's up."
Feds will be putting you away for ten years easy.
"But give us the transplant surgeon, and we'll see to it that you're home by Christmas."
"Oh, man."
"You guys didn't hear a word I said, did you?"
This guy thinks he's the second coming.
"Well, he's got a point."
- Are you an organ donor?
- Yup.
I thought Jews had to be buried with all their body parts.
I figure the Big guy will give me a pass if I leave a piece of myself to help someone else.
- What about you?
- I told Kathy I wanna.
Did you check off that little box on your license?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- I know why.
You're afraid to face your own mortality.
"- Well, who isn't?"
It wasn't human.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
And?
I haven't come up with anything conclusive.
"I'm not an expert or anything, but I have a theory."
Yea?
I figure...
I figure heaven...
"is probably a place where, nobody cares how big or small you are, or what you look like."
People probably don't even have bodies.
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.
"But if they do have bodies, everyone's gotta be naked for sure, cause that's we all showed up here in the first place, right?"
"And also, if you have a back problem... or bad knees or self-esteem issues."
That stuffs won't bother you anymore up there.
And everything's free too.
Or at least whole sale.
"I don't know if there's animal, but that'd be cool."
"Oh yea, and when you walkin' in to the gate for the very first time."
They're probably playing' that Louis Armstrong's song.
Somethin' nice like that.
Part of this came from this girl I knew.
She died.
It's a long story.
"Anyway, she thought everybody would be naked, that part was her idea."
- How did she die?
- I don't wanna talk about it!
"I mean, I do but... when I tried, never works."
Maybe someday.
Wow!
Sit up.
Who wants some snack?
You know what?
Wow!
- This dealer hasn't violated any state or federal laws?
- No.
- Hotel or Gaming Commission policies?
- I don't believe so.
"And there's no acts of moral turpitude, no guest complaints?"
What about the boss's complaints?
You have no grounds for dismissal.
And I assume I can't fire you for providing completely disagreeable advice.
I can't fire him.
Happy?
I'm so sorry.
"Well, don't celebrate too much."
I have a plan.
Can't wait.
I want you to find a cooler.
"Did you just say a ""cooler""?"
"Yeah, I just said a cooler."
Right.
"Monica, I know people talk about coolers, oh, and they made the movie, but, uh, there's no such thing as a cooler."
Did I hear someone mention a cooler?
"Hi, Monica."
Because I am one.
"Every time I go to a table, whoever's there starts to lose."
"Doesn't matter how much they were winning before, I show up, everything heads south."
It's wacky.
"Delinda, I want you to go over to that table... and stand as close to the dealer as you can get."
- I don't want to make people lose.
"- Oh, I guess I'd call it an order."
I'm just here to try to patch things up with my father.
We're not really speaking.
I work at Pure.
"Oh, my mistake."
Which is to our good fortune.
Still havin' you here with us.
"So happy to keep you happy, Daddy."
Livy and Ellie are waitin' on me.
We're goin' to the suffragette rally this afternoon.
"Do you want to come, Tootsie?"
I promised Abigail I'd baby sit little Camden.
"What about Annie Laurie's tea dance, Zelda?"
Isn't that today?
Those affairs are insufferable.
"More so than the ""insufferablegette"" rally?"
I find it gratifying that
Zelda has so many activities to choose from.
"Well, I'm off to march, wave signs and shout slogans that would curl your hair."
Nothing to love about women voting.
Sorry I'm late.
Your family takes forever to eat lunch.
- Livy.
"- Well, she's right, Ellie, they do."
I thought you changed your mind.
I wouldn't miss this.
"It's historic, and happening right here in little old Montgomery."
Not to mention it's something to write about in your next letter to Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.
"Dearest Scott, the rally was ever so amazing."
"Why do you keep writing him, anyway?"
"Well, just because I told him I wasn't gonna marry him doesn't mean I can't correspond, does it?"
"- Come on, Zelda."
- Whatever is the matter now?
"I'm comin', I'm comin'."
Woman:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.
You're lying.
"- Marcy, no..."
- Stop it!
A man broke into my car.
He warned me about you.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Believe me.
"You want to get away from your father, don't you?"
Not like this.
"It's for us, Marcy."
The thing is...
I'm gonna need that money back.
Where is it?
That man.
He took it.
Got your 911.
What's up?
Amanda McNeil.
The refrigeration unit shut down.
Must have some kind of short circuit.
That is crap.
"Whatever caused it, the accelerated decomp liquefied her organs."
Not much chance I'll be able to confirm cause of death.
That was not an accident!
This is Judy Nash coming to you live from outside the Collins Estate in Buckhead.
"Last night, the FBI launched a tactical assault on the Quarry Tunnel in connection with their search for Sara Collins."
"Although the cause is unknown, the assault ended in near tragedy with a structural collapse."
The FBI has released the identity of one of the men believed to have abducted Sara.
"That man is Mark Valera, found dead in the trunk of his own car two nights ago."
Anyone with information about Mr. Valera is asked to call the hotline.
The FBI is also continuing their search for Jessica Nevins.
"Since her divorce from Senator Collins,"
"The posts that you're referring to,"
Raina told me about them weeks ago.
She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.
But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
Not one word of what she wrote was actionable.
So if you think you're gonna turn this into a basis of a homicide investigation...
Tendu and I had a meeting.
Two days ago.
What?
"Well, I didn't tell you 'cause I thought if an attorney was there, it might scare him away."
"We met in my office, and we made a deal."
I promised to support indigenous seal hunting if he would come out against commercial seal hunts.
Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.
"Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble."
Can you prove any of this?
I have a draft of the agreement at my office.
We both signed it.
I can send you a copy.
You can ask other people at the meeting.
"My assistant, Tendu's girlfriend, Libena."
Libena-- that's a Czech name.
I guess so.
"I don't know, she had a thick accent."
Why?
Is that important?
(knocking)
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
You okay?
You don't look so good.
(lock clicks)
I didn't get much sleep last night.
"While you, mister... you have been cooped up at sea, eating nothing but broth and dry biscuits."
"Aye, but I still have the beating of a savage in me."
Especially when they cost me so much!
I do not think so.
You can't defeat us all.
Last blood for me as well.
You haven't shed it yet.
Now who's on their back?
What the hell's going on?
Get your scurvy arses back down below.
You have to go now.
Go!
Keep your gun on them all.
*********
He fell overboard.
He'll do well to survive with that wound he has.
Then good riddance.
"Well, at least they're stuck here a while longer while they fix our ship."
I don't think atkins and his men will travel too far into the jungle anymore.
"Today, the battle may have been lost, but the war is far from over."
"Have faith, my friend."
We will get you home.
Come.
"The reason Lian is able to treat Gong Xi seriously is she completely focuses on her acting, such that no one can tell her foot is in fact injured."
"Before the guest leaves, I can't collapse."
Gong Xi...
Gong Xi!
"Please give me another opportunity, let me have another try."
Please.
You gave me 100 points?
Despite having no talent you nevertheless go all-out.
We would both welcome an end to this war.
"By the way, you will let me have that book back if you've finished with it, won't you?"
Sir...
[Distant gunfire and men shouting commands]
[Airplane]
Your unit number?
"I need your name, rank, and regiment..."
[Men speaking indistinctly]
"I'll see if I can help, sir, if that's all right."
Go ahead.
[Airplanes]
[Speaking indistinctly]
I didn't expect to see you here.
"Well, they told me you were back."
And you thought you'd come for David before he scarpered.
No.
I've come to tell you that I know he had nothing to do with the murder.
We picked up 15 of our boys... 15...
And there were thousands of them there.
You've never seen anything like it-- white sand stretching out for Miles...
Ships everywhere-- hundreds of them.
"Motorboats, trawlers."
Picking up 15 here and 15 there.
"You know, we're gonna get the army out of there."
We're gonna do it.
There were bodies.
You saw them on the beaches.
"And as we went in there, the Germans were coming after us-- stukas, dorniers."
"I was lucky, though."
There was some sort of refinery burning and the smoke-- it protected us for a while.
Where is David?
I told you I'd bring him back to you.
I will kill him if he is seen again.
Send him away from here immediately.
Fine sir..
- Jai..
Coming Vasu
Good Morning madam
Good Morning Karthik.
How are you?
Where are you going quickly Mr. Muthyam?
New sites have come from Pune and I need to show them to Sir.
You said sites and why are there items here?
So are these what you show to Sir daily in the name of sites?
"No sir, these are the sales girls selling us the sites."
"They are not like sales girls, but look very indecent."
"Be quiet, you always get such waste doubts."
"Mr Macha, you please leave."
Not that madam..
- You please leave!
Thank you madam..
"They look a bit peculiar as said by Ratnam sir, madam"
"Looking at this, may be what they wrote in the magazines too is true."
Mr Ratnam!
I ate the salt of your father.
I cannot bear when something is going wrong.
"What is your intention, Ratnam sir?"
Do you doubt that those are not spouses and sir himself has set them up for acting?
"I was into a confusion till now, but it is now confirmed."
Doubt No. 1:
Some fellow had come called sir as brother-in-law.
Doubt No. 2:
"When she was hit, sir is shivering with anger."
Doubt No. 3:
You never said ...um...
the show is not gonna be ready today.
"If we would have known that we wouldn't be ready tomorrow, we wouldn't be playing tomorrow."
I'm slightly irritable beyond slightly... if we don't play tomorrow I'll be really really mad.
Nothing could have been left to fucking bullshit...
"Now, I've wasted all day in doing this, you know,"
I'll probably be up all night with you guys.
In terms of general looks.
Let me just...
do you have a pen on you?
That song should be super-moody...
Help Me I am In Hell should be... you're just watching a light show.
Let's just do this.
We'll start trying to get this to happen.
Tomorrow at noon we'll see where we are.
"You know, maybe everything's done, perfect in time, cool, by this afternoon..."
It's because we have the framework that works.
Here is the other challenge that we never done before.
"Normally the set is orchestrated, started out, come back up..."
"Ok, wait!"
"Ok, wait up!"
We'll be right there!
We're gonna do a little sideburn?
Am I good?
You good.
Check it out.
Hey Trent!
Awesome dude!
You fucking pigs
Fuck you
"Step right up, march, push."
"Crawl right up on your knees, please, greed, feed."
"A once in a lifetime, down and dirty, secret,"
"Prohibition party, in our old so humble ground."
- A what party?
"- A prohibition party, a speakeasy."
Here is how it's gonna work.
"Upstairs, there's gonna be the authority pleasing Great Gatsby party."
"Downstairs, will be a delightful, delicious,"
- Den of inequity.
- You've heard of the 18th amendment?
"You know, alcohol was illegal in the 20s."
Is that why they call it the Great Depression?
"This is absurd, Lizzi is never going to allow a speak-easy."
- Lizzi's never going to know about it.
- Where are we having this party?
What respectable fraternity is ever going to agree to this risk.
It's already arranged.
We're doing it in the KT house.
I still have aches from the last time we partied with them.
Score baby.
I can't believe Casey's endorsing a secret party.
Those girls are super hot.
Rebecca Logan is the hottest.
"Gentleman, please, come on."
Let's respect the ladies and try to stay on point here.
Who here is with me?
It's gonna be awesome.
We'll wear flapper dresses and garter belts.
So we throw this dangerous party.
What do we do if Lizzi finds out about the secret room?
We could loose our social calendar.
What?
That's not acceptable.
That guy who was just here.
He's a special cop trained to track down foxes.
Special cop?
Didn't you watch that documentary on TV?
Everyone knows after watching that.
We have no time to watch TV.
"Wait, wait!"
There's a way that the special cop tracks down foxes.
He was testing you before.
The 'yes or no' thing.
That's exactly his method.
"Yeah, I was really confused before."
You're dead!
Will we eat him or not?
- What?
- Let's eat him after we talk.
"My sweety, be patient."
"- Now, keep going."
"- According to America's MK report, the number of foxes pretending to be human came out to 3,824,790.5 across the globe."
What's the 0.5 for?
Did I say that?
"Well, that one's a mixed blood."
So they organized the F.T.B.H.
The Fox-To-Become-Human secret community.
They kill people at will.
That's nonsense.
We don't kill anyone at will.
"Since we have to eat human liver on the 1000th year to become human, we don't kill anyone beforehand."
Right!
Rumors are always exaggerated anyway.
"Anyway, if you kill me now, you will be arrested by the police who are waiting to find evidence."
"Fox fur coats sold like hot cakes on the home shopping channel the other day, you know."
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.
"And the fracturing of his skull: point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
The servants?
They have visitors?
Not at all.
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning...a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's it's very remote."
"No, never mind."
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
Thank you.
"It's called grieving, Shay."
"It got embarrassing, Arlo."
"Hey, hey."
"Look, what I'm trying to say is maybe her process hasn't started yet."
Did she tell you about the postcards?
The ones her mother supposedly sent from all over the world?
"Wait, so someone was trying to pretend her Mum was still alive even though she's been dead all these years?"
"Unless Trina sent them from beyond the grave, it looks that way."
"What, like someone was trying to cover up her murder?"
"Well, there are other explanations."
"Well, yeah, but not as cool."
Some revision still might be a good idea.
"If you want, I can help."
"It's Media Studies, Arlo."
"It's not like brain science, or whatever."
You sitting an exam today?
I kind of have too.
"Well, couldn't you get a dispensation, given the circumstances?"
"Nah, I did like no work all year, so if I don't pass the exam I am sunk."
Oh.
Eggs?
Poached not fried.
Two.
"With avocado, not tomato."
"But hey, the good news is this is the last exam, so once it's over it's party time!"
Yay!
My God!
"Your mother is dead, Lindsay."
You can't just pretend it didn't happen.
Shay.
Look...
"I get that you were all totally gutted when your Mum died, but mine chose to leave us."
- Height?
"- Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What colour hair?
- No hair.
Dude is balder than you.
"1963, James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine."
"1975, breaking and entering."
"1 982, grand theft auto."
"1 984, armed robbery."
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.
"City, state and federal, he's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside."
Entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
Sometime during the Clinton administration Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound of your finest meth."
"Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'll represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
Fifty goes to me.
We're going home now.
I want us all to have dinner together.
I want the whole family... to stay together.
Please.
The sixth day.
The heavens and earth were finished and all their array.
On the seventh day God completed His work.
God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work.
"Blessed are You, our God, Who creates the fruit of the vine."

"Alex, why don't you answer my calls?"
Are you afraid?
Are you avoiding me?
The play is about to open.
I didn't have time to call you back.
"Don't lie, I know you're avoiding me."
I'm not.
"It's not only me, it's everyone in the theater."
"We talked, I consulted with them."
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Publicly speaking, there's a problem here."
Publicly?
Do you want to hang him on top of everything?
I can't put a stop to the drift against him.
You are artistic director now.
You're just throwing him to the dogs?
I can't have him back until the trial is over.
And we all feel like we've been betrayed.
How did he betray you?
By fabricating expenses?
Didn't all of you fabricate expenses?
Not in those amounts.
Give me the whip!
"Adios, senor."
"Adios, Satipo."
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
And you thought I had given up.
You chose the wrong friends.
"This time, it will cost you."
"Too bad the Hovitos... don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
"Yes, too bad."
"You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos."

"All right, let's get back to this site:"
"Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton."
"Contains a central pas-passage and three chambers, or cysts don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow."
This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology..
"not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place.."
"no, I'm talking about folklore."
"In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find."
- Lord Kim Woo-jing.
"I can see that he harbors great ambitions, but he won't show it."
What is this great ambition?
What other ambition could a royal family member have?
It is to become king.
Please watch your words.
It could be interpreted as him plotting treason.
"It will be treason if he fails, but if he succeeds he will gain the world."
I will do anything if I can put a king on the throne.
You haven't gained your calm yet.
Your sword seemed to be thirsty for blood.
Our plan will fail if you act in haste.
Go to Chunghae at daybreak.
"Yes, sir."
Go to Chunghae?
Jang Bogo's men are guarding every inch of Chunghae.
It is impossible to penetrate into Chunghae.
I have a plan.
Do not worry.
Who are you?
We're pirates from Manwol Island.
We heard that Grand Chief Jang Bogo would spare our lives if we surrendered.
I need to go to Yangzhou.
Why?
I want to bring potters from Yangzhou.
"Kangjin, which is not far from Chunghae, has great soil for pottery making."
I will bring pottery makers and build a kiln.
We need to create jobs for the pirates who surrendered.
"If you open a pottery workshop, I will train them to be potters."
- Grand Chief.
- What is it?
The Manwol pirates have surrendered.
Let's see.
Here it is.
- Have you talked to her?
"- No, and don't go on about it."
"Good-bye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover."""
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Alfredo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy,"
"and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
"""You're selfish."
"You only think of yourself."""
"""I've got it!"""
"""It could be dangerous."
"I still haven't tested it on humans."""
"""Do you still think I'm selfish?"""
"""It's done wonders for you!"""
"""Don't worry, my love!"""
"""I'll find the antidote!"""
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Alfredo was shrinking daily."
"""I'll always love you."""
"To stop her suffering, Alfredo left."
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
"Look, both your brother and sister have entered the best universities."
"Kaan, if you tried a bit harder, you could succeed too."
He's got no discipline.
How was life in Germany?
It was like a ticking clock.
You grew up there too but this rascal isn't like that.
"Once he lifts his head away from the books, he instantly thinks of his guitar."
I can't control you all the time.
You have to want it yourself.
"I agree dad, you are absolutely right."
I feel ashamed instead of you.
It's such a shame!
Is this behavior suitable for you?
Don't you want to attent to university.
Of course There are many universities I can be registered at with my scores.
What do you mean?
How are you going to get into the Faculty of Medicine?
Stop pushing him.
"Maybe, he would like to study something else."
Is that so?
Don't you remember fantasizing when you were a kid?
You kept on saying you'd become a doctor like Aunt Nesrin's cousin.
"- Who's Aunt Nesrin's cousin, mom?"
- Don't you know?
What was it?
Mesut.
"Yeah, Mesut."
He graduated from medicine.
"Dad, he didn't finish medical school."
The school finished him.
Don't you remember him looking like this every time he came to us?
"Now, he's calling him an ox."
I'm Dave.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
How are you doing?
This is where we normally jam at.
Everybody know to come here when you guys start singing?
"Oh, yeah."
My grandfather was one of the ones who introduced the drums to the church.
That's right.
"You know, Ben told me about that."
"It's an honorable, respectable family tradition, so much that you have it passed down from generation to generation."
It just brings so much joy to all of us when we can just come together and be able to just play together.
I don't know if every city considers music to be that important.
"And as a musician, I mean, that's the holy land."
Right now the storm is 225 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.
We had a little gazebo in front of the house.
"Thank you, Killelea."
We will let your teacher know.
What do we think?
Mr Chandler?
Not quite up to it.
Mr Kirkby?
Button off.
He had a button off his jacket.
Slippery slope.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
Hey.
"There's auditions in here, hop it."
"No, I've come for the auditions."
"Well, they're over."
"Again I say unto thee, hop it."
- Okay.
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah.
"- You know, sometimes, if you just press on the temple--"
"You have a headache, don't you?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
"- Look, 'cause, like, your whole face is full of strawberries."
"You're sensitive, aren't you?"
Redheads are sensitive.
"- Yeah, I guess so."
- When's your birthday?
Are you a Virgo?
- Yeah.
"- I knew it, I knew it, see."
"I do just a little bit of palm reading and can do horoscopes, charts."
This woman taught me.
- Who taught you?
"- Yeah, she was a pill-popping, you know, astrologer, but she taught me how to read charts."
"It's fascinating, so I'm really good--"
Iâm really good with people.
I'm really great with strangers.
- So where did you work besides Chicago and Greece?
"- Oh, gosh, I worked in Vancouver for a while at this place called the Golfin' Dolphin, but they didn't have alcohol, but I served drinks, but it was just, like, you know,"
"water mixed with, like, flavored juice."
"I didn't work there long, but that was in Vancouver and that was a lot of fun."
"And then I worked in Iowa for a while and then Washington, D.C."
and then I worked in
"South Carolina, Charleston."
- Where are you from?
"- Are you-- Originally, Iâm from North Carolina."
"Raleigh, the capital."
You been there?
"You know, your old man, he loved them horses."
He absolutely loved them and you know that.
What is wrong with you?
Right now he's flipped around in that grave of his.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, boy."
"Matt, I think something that we can actually agree on is that we need to keep these horses healthy."
Because it's part of your deal as a permit holder.
- Correct.
- So it is in your best interest to make sure the horses are in good shape.
What're you saying?
"I'm just saying that maybe Ty, with his vet experience, should monitor the horses' condition while they're in your care, and I can help."
No.
They don't need to be monitored.
They're fine.
You don't know that.
"They're wild, right?"
So they could have any number of diseases.
Diseases that could spread to other stock.
To healthy stock.
"Come on, Matt."
What're you afraid of?
- Yeah!
- Let 'em check out the horses.
Fine.
Monitor the horses.
"But that's it, you hear me?"
"She said she loved me, Jeffie, and... she said I was just like my mom and she gave me all these pictures and stuff and..."
Okay.
"Well, can I call you once you're done work?"
Okay.
I'll let you know what it happens.
Okay.
"Hey Pakodi, Tiger Bhai has come."
Take Chilly Chicken and chilled beer.
['Sher'ishindiwordmeaning'Tiger']
"Yes, Tiger Bhai and Beer Bhai will come."
That Tiger Bhai will not come at all.
"It is Tiger Bhai, who came."
Why did you say Tiger Bhai then?
What do you say 'Tiger' in English?
- Tiger!
Have I served him for a year without knowing that?
What ?
Should I newly tell you the order?
"I should tell you a new matter, you are under arrest."
"Without knowing that you were Tiger Bhai, I fed the militants who crossed the border for a year."
Suzuki Subramanyam alias Peter alias Pakodi.
"Though I have no success, I did 16 undercover operations."
I was side tracked as bad luck is in my back pocket.
I will get into main track now by pushing you in.
"If you are undercover, all these are my cover."
We are the undercover to cover you sir.
Undercover for the undercover?
Excellent!
Do not underestimate diamond as it's light and department guy as he is short.
Thank you guys.
I am very happy about my first success.
This is your last mission.
This is the last job I will be giving you.
"That means, are you dying sir?"
"- Suzuki sir, last mission for you"
"That means, am I going to die sir?"
- You will be retiring next month.
My God!
-There are only three small onions.
-Three onions?
How many tomatoes?
-Two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.
Johnny Dio did the meat.
"We had no broiler, so he did everything in pans."
It smelled up the joint something awful and the hacks used to die but he cooked a great steak.
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.
Medium rare.
An aristocrat.
When you think of prison you get pictures in your mind of all those old movies with rows and rows of guys behind bars.
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.
"It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy, who was doing his time in Atlanta."
Give me two steaks.
"Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, all mixed together, living like pigs."
But we lived alone.
We owned the joint.
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
They deserved it.
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe wouldn't rat on the guys that we did.
People used to be able to leave their doors open.
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.
-We'll have to do something about that bastard.
-l took care of him.
What'd you bring?
Some bread.
"Vinny, I got your peppers and onions."
"Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese."
"Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"
"I did it all with my trusty flute and... oh, never mind."
You wouldn't believe it anyway.
Let's get moving.
You run into the portal.
I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.
"No, you're too hurt."
You need a healer.
"Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my fight now.
Korra.
I love you.
"I love you too, dad."
Yipyip.
"Once we're inside, you go find Jinora."
"Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape."
Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.
"So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you."
Are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?
"If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after harmonic convergence."
If not...
Let's go.
"Tenzin, go find Jinora."
Come on!
"You're running out of time, Raava."
I know you feel it coming.
You guys.
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady, and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
All that stuff we put on the table just now?
"Let's talk about it later, okay?"
"Right, yeah."
That's probably a good idea.
When the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble.
I'm gonna call Kirsten and Sandy.
Where's my jacket?
Gross.
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the apocalypse or whatever."
Got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods.
A space heater.
-And an extra pair of....
-I'm not--
"Hey, couldn't get reception in here."
I'm gonna step out in the hall.
Okay.
Okay.
"Yes, Orange County, as you've probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities."
"But power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
"As more information comes in, we 'll relay it to you."
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
"So we got our marching orders, or our staying-put orders."
So no one' s to leave the plaza unless they have to.
What are we gonna do with everyone?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
-What about looters?
-We just have to get organized.
"So keep the radio on, gather up anything you think might be useful."
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
AII of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
Some rituals used in the Black Mass.
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"Please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
That didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
"So, on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
Lewd pervert!
Even the other day...
Your illustrations are really erotic.
"You can't just say that to a girl, s-so suddenly!"
Do you have to get that angry?
I was talking about how I was requesting lewd illustrations from my little sister!
"L-Lewd illustrations are my job, and I like it, so it's okay!"
But you can't talk about stuff like that!
Why?
Th-That's...
"Big Brother, you idiot!"
Dunce!
Light-novel protagonist!
Fine.
I won't say it again.
It's fine if you understand.
"I-In the first place, Big Brother, you're all sorts of no good."
All sorts?
F-For instance...
That's right!
You stay at home too much on days off!
"Writing is my side job, so of course I'd be home working!"
Even during summer vacation?
Right.
"Back then, everything I wrote was getting turned down, so I pulled a lot of all-nighters."
So I forgot to make you meals.
"The despair I felt when meals didn't arrive even after thumping the floor do you know how that feels, Big Brother?"
Come out of your room and eat.
I think I've lost if I leave my room!
"Even if you say it like a famous quote, it's not cool."
"By the way, I noticed you blog and stream stuff."
I-Is that bad?
Adriana!
"No, wait!"
"Yes, he is quite free for the night!"
"Lucrecia,"
Lucrecia!
"Yes, Luigi?"
"Come immediatedly, I must speak with you."
"I am coming, just a moment."
Luigi?
"What is wrong, why so nervous?"
"Its one of the models, I remember her from somewhere, but don't know where!"
Which one?
The red headed one.
"You are imagining things, Luigi, she is one of our must trusted models."
"Do you think that all the precautions our organisation has taken, are useless?"
Its that we must not take any risks.
"Has it dawned on you that it is insane for all of us to remain here, together?"
"Any slight error, can finish our organisation, with one blow."
You know it is necessary.
"I have been working here for the last two months, and nothing abnormal has happened."
"All is rolling along, please Luigi, do not worry."
"Say, Lucrecia, when do you go on stage?"
"In just a moment,"
Don't you enjoy seeing me as an entertainer in a night club?
You would enjoy it even more to see me as a designer of swimwear.
"can you help me , please?"
May I?
Thanks
I must congratulate you.
You swim quite well.
"I have already thanked you, what else can I say to you, Mr. Dinamo?"
"Ah, you know my name, that means you have heard of me."
We neutralized the last zombie specimens.
"Thanks to Hybra Tech, there hasn't been a single zombie outbreak in over 10 years."
"Hybra Tech, chemical solutions for the entire planet."
THE RETURN OF MORTOS PART 4
- NECROPOLIS
Entry to the exclusion zone without permission is forbidden.
You like the singing?
Nathalia Lavina.
She is the Russian Britney Spears.
How much further?
"Don't be so nervous, we will be there in a couple of minutes."
You are sure that they are here?
"Yes, they are here my friend."
This is the best place to keep them safe.
This is it.
"Don't worry, the Geiger-Counter is a precaution."
The level of radiation is the same as a ray-x of teeth.
Bullshit you hear about this place...
Just to get more money from you Americans.
What was that?
Don't worry.
Suppose someone finds us here?
Everything is fine my friend.
I have made arrangements for the security for this place.
We are in the base of the main reactor.
"You can make a ""tour"" if you like."
Would you like to see the place where they make the big boo-boo?
No!
Let's cut the 50 cent tour and tell me where the hell they are.
Behind you.
The last of the Trioxin-5 canisters.
Is this all of them?
I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the hurricane straits.
"We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses."
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now.
This is serious.
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.
But I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops.
There's a problem.
Mom!
I'm so happy you're here.
Where's dad?
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.
I'll get him back.
Where is my mother?
She's in the healing hut.
So many injured.
What happened?
Her soul is trapped in the spirit world.
"Oh, my goodness."
How long has she been away?
Almost a week.
"I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away."
"You're the only one who can help her now, mom."
How much longer can she survive like this?
I don't know.
But she's very strong to have lasted this long.
I talked to the rebels.
They said Unalaq's got the Southern portal surrounded.
Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away.
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
There's no use in talking anymore.
We know what our mission is.
News waits for no one...
Not even Chloe.
"You texted her, you left her, three voicemail messages at the apartment."
She's not Helen Keller.
She'll get the message and meet us there.
It wouldn't kill us to wait a few more minutes.
I agree with Mr. Olsen.
Why are we outside of the kitchen?
"It's a little late for a snack, isn't it?"
"I've seen you around here before, haven't I?"
You work for Lex.
He has nothing to do with this.
I'm here about that photograph you took.
Which photograph would that be?
Because I take a whole lot of pictures.
L. Luthor in his office before he killed himself.
I want that photo destroyed.
His death was tragic enough without it being sensationalized by the media.
You could have said that before you broke out the heavy artillery.
"As soon as we saw it, I immediately jumped on the delete button."
This is all a big misunderstanding.
You're lying.
I deleted it.
"After I saw your text message,"
I went into the mainframe and pulled it from your hard drive.
But the transfer log shows you uploaded the file to a second server with a cloaked IP Address.
I want to know where.
- You shot me?
!
- You weren't cooperating.
- How about a warning?
- Tell me or she dies.

"""My dear friend Baldev, We're fine here"""
"""We hope to God that you, your wife and the children are well too"""
"""You will be pleased to hear that my son has graduated in arts"""
"""He has joined my business."
"By God's grace, it's time now... for us to let our childhood friendship mature into a relationship"
Let's make good the promise we made to each other 20 years ago.
I hope... you will come here at the soonest for Simran's wedding to Kuljit
Read on
She's shy!
See Lajjo?
"That's our etiquette, our culture"
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure
"In the heart of London, I've kept India alive!"
Still staring?
"Lajjo, your daughter's wedding!"
Celebrate it with sweets
Chutki!
I'm so happy today
Can I say one thing?
- Say four things
It'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?
"Ever since she was a baby, she has known that she is engaged to Kuljit"
That she knows.
But20 years...
- Don't you worry!
Simran is going to be so happy... you'll pray that she never gets the evil eye!
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God!
It was rigged to explode.
A S.W.A.T. agent was killed.
- Was anthrax involved?
- No.
Then that's not the final target.
"You look troubled, my friend."
You killed one of my men.
I was here with you.
The second location was a trap.
One of my agents was killed in the explosion.
This is war.
We expect casualties.
Shouldn't you?
- He was a good man.
"- Well... if he would convert, there would be no reason for him to fear death."
What do you say to his family?
I say:
Where... were you to mourn... when my son was murdered?
- His son?
- Did you see that?
"When he told the story about his childhood, the bomb landing in the bazaar, his behavior changed."
We know he was lying.
Garcia couldn't find any record of a bombing during the time Jind Allah was a boy.
"Exactly, but this time when he mentioned his son, he looked at his hands, like he had to concentrate to control his anger."
That first story wasn't about him.
It was about his son.
Which means it must have been more recent.
Garcia.
"I need you to look for a bombing again in Egypt, but this time anything in the last ten years."
On it.
"We're looking for civilian casualties, an 8-year-old boy."
Okay.
You were so funny last night.
- Ohh.
I was wondering if you could help us out?
Oh I'd be delighted to share my... comedic expertise.
We who are clowns are known for our generosity.
Maybe you can help us settle an argument we were having.
Shoot.
What's funnier?
This... or this?
Or... is two at once funny?
How about... this?
Is this funny?
I think... this.
You are so right!
That is funny!
Thank you so much for helping us.
I'm glad I could be of service.
"Now if you'll excuse me,"
I have a class to teach.
"You know, it's a remarkable feeling to be able to make someone else laugh."
"It's almost as if you have the power to get inside their brain, and tickle it."
I can do that with a chopstick.
"Imagine how different war would be, if instead of trying to kill each other, people just showed up armed with jokes."
"But you could still have guns, right?"
"Because, you know, eventually you'd stop laughing, and want to get on with the killing."
You know what I found out?
Humour's subjective.
What do you mean?
"Well, I thought the fact that no one was laughing at you at the comedy club was hysterical."
"Oh, I loved that."
No no.
"No, that wasn't funny."
"Selena, I'm so very happy for you."
"Selena, I'm so happy for you."
Mother?
"Come on, Norman!"
We finally discovered that season of love... it is only found in someone else's heart.
"Right now,someone you know is looking everywhere for it."
And it's in you.

"Where I was born, time was told not by the clock or the calendar but by the seasons."
Summer was carefree contentment.
Autumn was that bittersweet time of regret for moments that had ended and things that were yet undone.
And then winter fell with a cold mantle of caution and chill.
It nipped our noses and our arrogance and made use move closer to the warm stoves of memory and desire.
Spring was promise.
But there was a fifth season of love and only the wise or the lucky ones knew where to find it.
"Hey, mister, which way to Peyton Place?"
"Go up this road, about two miles."
You'll come right to the town.
Thanks.
Lucas stole my money.
He drinks everything in sight.
I saved for a year and a half for a course.
"Don't go, Paul."
You was my firstborn... .
- Hitting everyone in his way.
Even you.
- Only when he's drinking.
That's been every night.
Why did you marry him?
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of Kara and Brainiac.
I can't let Lana sit in that asylum in pain.
Only way to help her is to find Brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
There's no bogey or blip unaccounted for.
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about Brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, Chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at Luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was Lionel Luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you.
You killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but Lionel Luthor left a lot of damage in his wake."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"He did a lot of things, but he'd never commit suicide."
I don't know about that.
He was beyond disturbed
But who sees it in your eyes?
How am I going to behave?
"Those boys are only friends, aren't they?"
Do you think they like it when someone clings to them?
"You'll see, someone will appreciate that more."
Maybe. I haven't yet met anyone who appreciates it more.
They always talk to the kind who cling to everyone immediately.
"The other day your registrar said they pay sixty crowns in Moravia, and us only fifteen."
My sister-in-law's sister said that in Central Slovakia they even pay a hundred.
- l've heard that too.
- Us fifteen...
That's despicable!
"I'm telling you, it's only in Nitra they pay so badly."
"Elsewhere, as you say, it's at least fifty."
"You understand, we're qualified, you're in that society... the Committee for Civil Affairs."
"As a member, they only got me from the music school just to..."
- l feel so worn out...
- You're tired?
- How many more?
- lt's dragging on today.
- Nothing's on time!
- They're saying goodbye at home.
- And have they even paid?
- That photographer...
"Yes, yes..."
- How lovely!
- What's lovely about it?
Really.
What do you see in it?
Look at this... here...
"Don't take it off, if we put..."
"We'll put something blue here, blue buttons, that'll make you a bit slimmer..."
- You cannot break the Internet.
- Um.
"He was scared at first, a little panicky."
"He paced, slugged away at the form, swore a lot, but once he figured out his way back to the home page, there was no stopping him."
He was surfing the Internet like a 17-year-old.
"- So, what did you think?"
"- Worst form in the world, pain in the ass,"
- but it took me places.
"- In the end, the form itself became a personalized website, a profile page full of photos, life experiences, and friends."
"The senior volunteers were scared at first, but they all booked repeat sessions."
They loved that they had a place on the Internet.
Thank you.
- When will you come to Halifax?
- Oh.
You need a bigger team.
My office in Hamilton
"- serves 81,000 seniors."
- Oh.
"This is your whole life now, you realize that?"
Would the same thing work on kids?
I mean really young kids.
"Uh, would you just excuse me?"
"Mr. Renn, what are you doing here?"
"I came to see your presentation, of course."
It was excellent.
"- It's wonderful to see you, Mr. Renn."
- We're all very proud of you.
You had such poise up there.
"When you were working with us,"
I was worried about you.
You had your anxiety issues.
But look at this!
We'll have our own religion in our own building.
"Oh, this does not seem very attainable."
"You should set your sights a little bit smaller, like"
- A new shoe cubby for the mosque.
"- Yeah, I'm with Baber,"
"But to be fair, I don't really care."
"I thank you for your honesty, Rev. Baber, you have wanted this for years."
I just don't think now is a good time.
People will think we're up to no good.
- Why?
"- People will see the minarets and think,"
"- ""Uh-oh, Muslims!"""
- Naturally.
"And then, they'll see innocent old Baber buying some lawn fertilizer and blamo!"
They'll think we're going to blow something up.
Why would they think that?
And why would you be buying fertilizer?
Your lawn is full of weeds and crabgrass.
"Well, that's exactly why I would be buying fertilizer."
My point is proven.
Point not proven!
No one's even going to think you're capable of blowing anything up!
Challenge accepted!
You will see the authorities will be right at my door!
- AMAAR:
"Salaam alaikum, Sarah."
"- Hi, Amaar."
- You wanted to talk to me?
"- Yeah, I needed your help with a presentation tonight at the town meeting for the new mosque."
"Look, Amaar, I would love to help..."
"Great, I will get you the plans right away."
"No, no, no."
STEVE:
"Oh, of cour..."
"I'm sorry, right."
So somebody else killed him and you covered it up?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's the truth.
Is it?
We didn't want anyone connecting Cutler back to us.
"So, yes, we covered it up."
"Look, Cutler was feeding us good intel."
There was... there was no reason to kill him.
"In fact, we tried to save him."
What?
What are you talking about?
He called us for help right after he'd been shot.
"And-and I can prove that, too."
We had a burner phone that we kept in touch with him...
We know about the phone.
What happened next?
We sent a medic.
"But by the time he got there,"
Cutler had been dead for a while.
"After that, we were just, you know, worried about controlling the situation."
Damage control.
"Well, maybe you ought to start worrying about your legal defense, because right now you're looking at obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact."
Okay.
"Yeah, you got me dead to rights."
But... maybe... we could help each other out.
How do you figure?
"Well, what if I were to say that, um... in the course of cleaning the crime scene, my people... may have gathered evidence."
Evidence that could help you catch whoever killed Cutler.
(sighs) What a mess.
I like a man who can answer his own questions.
Saves me from stating the obvious.
Look after her.
- Hmm.
Fresh straw and everything.
You think he's joking.
Have you spoken to him?
"- If this is what he wants, we can't stop him."
You forgotten how old he is?
- I was a year younger.
"If you were my son, I'd have stopped you."
You wouldn't have had the option.
"Young men are drawn to war like moths to flame, Mim."
It's their chance to prove themselves.
Or be blown to pieces trying.
From a bullet or regret - more than one way to die.
"Spare me the glory of the battlefield, Bryn."
It took us years to get through it.
You still can't pour a jug with a steady hand.
"That said, I'd sooner have gone than not."
David isn't ready.
- No-one is.
You're not listening.
It's not a choice.
Not for most.
"Well, now your precious Institute's closed, perhaps I'll have your full attention."
"You've always had my full attention, Bob."
"- No, no."
Your mind is frequently elsewhere when it should be focused on ensuring that the only breadwinner in the house is looked after.
"But if you'd allow me to work,"
I could alleviate some of the financial worry.
We've had this conversation.
INTERVIEWER:
So what are you looking over here?
"It's a short-term, I believe, contract-- 21 days."
And it looks in order.
But I'm gonna read it just to be sure.
Make sure I don't have to give up my first-born
Or something like that.
INTERVIEWER:
And what will that be for?

"Yo, you're supposed to stop"
People from going up here.
"You see, if they fall down, break their neck with babies."
So stop them from going through.
[Chatter]
We're gonna have a little problem
"Today, because people are going to be going up that step."
We're shooting now.
"If somebody goes up the steps when the cameras are rolling,"
"That's very bad, because it means we waste film."
Yeah.
"Because you know what'll happen,"
"They'll look at the camera behind them,"
And then that screws it up.
Because then people know that they aren't
Supposed to be in the movie.
"So have to make sure that the pedestrians, very politely,"
"Are told to go around the back, that we're making a movie,"
That we're going around the back.
"I don't want women with tiny babies coming through here,"
"Tripping over wires, bumping into people."
But we're still going to have to keep moving.
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
- That's all right.
- It's okay.
I won't think you're any less macho.
Someone else might need it more later.
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms.
The weapons I was sending to save you.
So I struck a new deal.
"We help get you out, and he gives us valuable information about a terrorist."
"Which he knows about, how?"
And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
"Colonel, we're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun."
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
If Stonebridge had managed to engage the Janjaweed then this would fit that scenario.
"Right, send through the image."
Julia thinks that lunatic might still be alive.
Really?
"It's probably nothing, it's an oil burn, or a blip."
Let me see that.
That's not nothing.
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Unfortunately I don't have the resources.
"- Oh, hey."
"Say, did you get Gene Hansen's toxicology report back?"
I'm looking for any evidence of narcotics.
I'll check and see when the results are due in.
"Okay, thanks."
Hey.
What's up?
You working that beetle mania case?
"Yes, I am."
I have reason to believe the club owner might have known about drug dealing in the establishment.
"If the drugs led to the kid's death, she could be held responsible."
"Uh-huh, you got it."
"Speaking of which, I need you to check some names for me - her and her staff."
See if they had any priors.
- Do you mind running them?
"- Sure, let's go."
"Yeah, I'll even throw in a little lunch, maybe a few..."
Wait a minute.
It usually takes a few minutes of sparkling repartee before you'll give up anything.
I'm trying to be nice.
Is that a crime?
"No, no."
Who's the customer?
"Hey, we doing this or not?"
Let's go.
All right already.
"Oh, glasses."
Hi.
"You know...when you're around someone long enough, you can spot their little clues, their 'tells'."
And this is apropos of...?
"Well, I was in the morgue today and Mike was there, you know, investigating that Jane Doe, and he offered to help me gather information, no questions asked."
That was nice of him.
Oh!
That's kind of devious.
"They might have, who knows?"
Were you in any kind of position where you could pretend that you weren't having sex?
Let's see.
You tell me.
"Johnny, tell me about the Catholic newsletter than you inadvertently subscribed to."
You don't have to.
We were having such a fun time.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Very religious household.
Three brothers.
"My dad, the only man who never actually had any porn in the house."
We went into other people's houses and their dad had a stash.
It was almost like being a dad meant having a stash.
"In the '70s, definitely."
"Inside the bath, the bath's plastic panels."
There you go.
"Mayfair, that sort of thing."
In the shed.
I could literally give you a tour of Carlisle of where all the porn was.
"I was a little girl, you know."
Cos there's nothing else to do.
It would be in a hedge.
"I used to walk dogs for the neighbours and walk round, because blokes who got rid of it hastily would throw it across the field."
Why is it always in a hedge?
Always in a hedge.
Porn would find you.
I feel sad now walking my dog.
There's no porn anywhere.
"You always think, ""Oh, God!"""
A badger attacks you.
"Now, he knows that you're part owner of Denver-Carrington."
He's trying to buy up that stock to gain a controlling interest in your company.
So he can drive a wedge between the two of us.
And then what he'll try to do is position you.
So that you have to side with him on anything at all relating to that pipeline.
Doesn't surprise me.
Doesn't surprise me one damn bit.
- Thank you for telling me about it.
"- Oh, well, I hope it helps."
"It does, it all helps."
"Well, I'll talk to you later."

- Good morning.
"Oh, could I see you in my office for a minute, please?"
"- Of course you may, Adam."
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
"Dominique, you know Jason Colby's chief counsel, Garrett Boydston."
I knew him once.
"No, thank you."
"Well, I need a complete fix on him."
"How he works, everything."
A personality and career dossier.
Yes.
"I'm sorry, Adam, but I am not in the dossier business this season."
"Look, anything, any little thing you can tell me will help."
"I've got to work with him, and at the moment, I'm flying blind."
I am no authority on Garrett Boydston.
You'll just have to find your spy elsewhere.
Dominique?
I didn't mean to strike a nerve.
Wanker.
Why don't you just stop being such a fucking pussy and let the fuck go?

"Mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination."
"I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol."
All were negative.
Don Flack did not kill this boy.
Find out what did.
"Now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?"
That's correct.
And what was his demeanor?
He was fine.
"So the kid's calm, perfectly healthy."
He agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
"He's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room."
"And then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead."
That's exactly whatappened.
"And if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you."
Did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
- Bruises?
- No.
Was Detective Flack ever alone with him?
"In the car, maybe?"
I drove.
Detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
We were together the entire time.
What about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
In the locker room.
Who accompanied him there?
Detective Flack.
Detective Flack.
Doesn't look good.

JACKIE ROBINSON HAS PUSHED US FORWARD.
"FOR HIM, THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION"
WITH SIMPLY BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM.
BARACK OBAMA:
PART OF WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON IS
PRECISELY HIS ABILITY TO APPROACH BASEBALL
AND THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF INTEGRATION
IN WAYS THAT WERE CONTRARY TO HIS CHARACTER
OR HIS FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG
IN SERVICE OF A LARGER CAUSE.
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN.
HE HAD PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND MANY TIMES OVER.
NARRATOR:
"ON APRIL 15, 1947, JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON BECAME"
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MODERN AGE
TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
[CHEERING]
"IN HIS FIRST SEASON WITH THE BROOKLYN DODGERS,"
"HE HAD SILENTLY ENDURED RACIST TAUNTS,"
"THREATS, AND ABUSE,"
PERFORMING SPECTACULARLY ON THE FIELD
AND BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEN IN THE COUNTRY.
"LATER, UNBURDENED OF HIS PROMISE TO BRANCH RICKEY TO KEEP QUIET,"
"TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,"
"AMERICANS WOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE REAL JACKIE ROBINSON,"
AND THEY WOULD NOT ALWAYS LIKE HIM.

Jacob is communing with his God right now.
There's nothing that you could label as abnormal in the scans.
But we haven't got all the tests results back yet.
Something is wrong.
This makes no sense.
Jacob always rebelled against his parents' religion.
Were his parents orthodox?
"Oh, yes, hard-core."
A tendency to believe in God can be inherited.
"There's... there's even a specific gene,"
"VMAT2, linked to religiosity."
Maybe your trip to Jerusalem triggered something that was already there in him.
I always knew his parents would ruin our marriage.

The 32 year old woman was taken from her home by homicide detectives and is assisting them with their inquiries.

It was a nice dream-- a cologne scientifically proven to attract women.
"First of all, it should be marketed towards women, not men."
"A perfume that a woman could put on to help her feel more sexual, perhaps even awaken a whole part of herself that's been dormant or repressed."
"You know, it is what's happening out there in the real world-- a sexual awakening."
That's exactly right.
"So, if we could tailor this research and turn it into a perfume"
- for women...
- But--
Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.

Not anymore.
He's a saboteur.
He's a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
"Come now, you threw a time bomb."
How could I have had a time bomb?
They searched me when they took me prisoner.
"And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely."
All I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.
I am not.

In the beginning aliens were spotted in places with large amounts of heroin.
"Later, aliens appeared in specific sub cultures, punk cultures."
Still around heroin and in these punk cultures many more strange deaths have occured.

"And if we did, she's armed, remember."

Then we have to get her to come out.
Well she's hardly likely to do that.
Oh yes she is.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
I want all the troops assembled at once.
"Yes, sir."
Damn it!
Any news?
The commander who represented Heng-In during that transaction was a man called Bae-Mang.
He defied orders and tried to embezzle the gold and weaponry that was to be used in exchange for our goods.
"His act was brought to light, and he was stripped of his position."
He then gathered a group of followers and renegaded.
A renegade?
You're saying those people after Miss are outlaws?
Yes.
I should have killed them all when I had the chance.
That's not all.
"They might be outlaws, but they were also soldiers and officers trained in the Heng-In Military."
"They will be well-trained, and battle hardy."
This is bad.

"""that all the family members were 100 percent Americans."""
Terrific!
This is a cadillac limousine!
"His son clark and wife, natalie... and their children michael and emily."
This michael and emily look like they are just about our age.
"And emily, she's a very beautiful girl."
"-Tateo, are you falling for her?"
-Stupid!
"""But all of them speak broken Japanese, which set our minds at ease."""
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with english.
"""After a comfortable drive of about 20 minutes..."
"""we arrived at Suzujiro's residence."
"""immediately we met Suzujiro, who was sick in bed."""
Is he Grandma's elder brother?
"""Suzujiro looked better than we had anticipated."
"- A neurosurgeon, one of the finest on staff."
- I want to speak to him.
"He's waiting for us, Mrs. Rickman."
I don't judge the living or the dead.
Antibus.
"I grant wishes, prayers and dreams."
Guardian of the gate.
Am I going to die?
This is Kingdom Hospital... which stands on uneasy ground.
"Here, the cold and damp have returned."
And as the gate swings open... the dead may also return.
"I'm going to give you a few moments alone with your husband now, if you'd like that."
- Would you like that?
- Yes.
"- I would like that, Doctor..."
- Hook.
"Now, you can speak to your husband, but... he will almost certainly not answer... although he may open his eyes."
Is he in a coma?
"He's not conscious or responsive now, but that is not unusual after trauma and surgery."
"Now, time may prove me wrong, but I don't expect him to be in a coma."
Is he awful?
No.
"You handled that brilliantly, Hook."
And thanks for putting him in the...
The Presidential Suite is what they call it up here.
Excuse me.
"I'll just let you handle this, then, shall I?"
Make one of the Kingdom apartments available to her... if that's appropriate.
There are lots of vacancies.
Peter?
Look at you.
Just look at you.
"Same as you, admiring the bikinis."
"Well, I doubt you would have come to Quito just for that."
I also doubt you came for the same.
"You know that wherever there are beautiful women, I shall be there."
I'll buy you a drink.
Lets.
"And, tell me, Inspector, how did your ...."
You where saying?
"No, I have a prior engagement, I will see you later."
Did you have any problems?
"No, everything is rolling along, Ms. Bristol."
"Except for one thing, that girl, I have seen her somewhere else."
Which one?
The red head.
A member of the International Service?
"I do not know, but it is something we must find out."
"There is no time for that, there is but one solution."
"There is, we must not take any risks."
"Truly, I am having the best of luck."
This is my first night off.
What did you say your name was?
I didn't say.
"Well, it does not matter, a name is not that important."
It seems you do not like to waste any time.
Of course not.
Then what are you doing here?
you will accompish nothing here.
"Well, It will have to be enough to just admire the view."
I tought you would have been more daring.
"You are right, I am actually quite shy."
"Tell me, are you still free tonight?"
Of course!
"Mandrian came in, discovered whoever it was, and had to be silenced."
"The murderer then went out, taking the saw with him."
"Sonheim's story is true, he just happened to be the one to discover the body."
Then who did kill Mandrian?
The same person who killed Rafford and Dortmunn.
And I know who that is now.
You know?
Yes.
"I should have seen it right from the start, but my mind had conditioned itself to see the wrong thing."
As Cally has been saying all along.
You found the meaning?
Yes.
Just before he died Rafford managed to scrawl this out.
54124?
Precisely What's it mean?
Absolutely nothing.
"As a number it has no significance at all, but in the filter plant just now, I noticed one of the instruments."
"Liquid crystals show a number, then the confirmation circuit translates those numbers into the written word."
"From the start, we thought that those were numbers."
"They are not, they are letters."
Letters?
Rafford was dying.
It's difficult to be neat under those circumstances.
Let's start with the one and the two.
And the first letter.
So now you know.
"It doesn't matter, you'd have known soon enough anyway."
"Sara, why?"
I wanted the neutrotope
Or at least the money it would give me.
It's that simple.
Was Mandrian in it with you?
It's been a Iong time.
I can't remember all of it.
Do you understand the Iyrics?
"No, I simply learned it by heart."
I think it's a childrens song.
A lullaby...
My sister and I used to sing a song.
We had two versions.
One we sang to our mother.
About the countryside and flowers.
The other I made up with my sister.
We only sang it when we were alone.
It went something like:
"""My slut mother fucked a bishop... in Heaven, they ate a piano and two children..."""
It rhymed in Hungarian.
It was funny.
Why tell me about your childhood?
To entertain you.
"When he was told of his impending execution, he accepted it with resignation."
Like sort of a relief.
From confessing to all the crimes.
"The real ones, as well as those"
I think were products of his fantasy.
He was taken to the firing squad at dawn.
Among those present:
"his defense lawyer, the judge who sentenced him, a priest... although he didn't ask for one... and a firing squad of 10 soldiers."
Only half of them fired real bullets.
The others shot blanks.
"That way, no one knew who fired the fatal shot."
I was present at the firing of the rifles.
He collapsed onto the ground.
The squad leader approached him.
Go.
"Well, Juliet..."
I will lie with you tonight.
"As to the means, I will not wonder long."
I do remember an apothecary who lives not far from here... if it is life... where there is neither gold... nor food... nor rest.
"Hey, there!"
Apothecary!
Who calls so loud?
Come over here.
I see that you're poor.
There is no crime in that.
"Nor pleasure, neither."
"Now, listen, I seek a kind of poison so powerful that swallowed in one dram, it stops a man and drops him in his tracks before he may but mark the consequence."
"If this be murder, the answer's no."
The victim's one I have right to kill.
I have such mortal drugs.
But Mantua's law brings death to any man who issues them.
"Are you so thin and full of wretchedness, yet scared to die?"
Famine is in your cheeks.
The world is not your friend.
"You will not find that cherishing the law makes you rich, be not poor, and break the law for this."
"My poverty, not my will, consents."
I pay your poverty and not your will.
I'm looking for Lord Romeo.
He is gone.
Gone?
And in great haste.
Back to Verona.
What purpose had you with him?
Nothing now.
You've had a wasted journey.
Who can say?
"He's a racist and a little shady, maybe, but a murderer?"
"It may be just a feeling, but I know he's in this."
We just need to figure out how.
Iayudame!
Iayudame!
Shot execution style just like all the others.
Why put him in there?
There must be something symbolically important.
There's something inconsistent about the staging.
"It's not remorse, and it's not a forensic countermeasure either."
Each of these families were registered gun owners.
That must be how he's selecting his victims.
He wants them to fight back.
It's propaganda for his race war.
He's turning the families into martyrs.
And the fall guy takes the blame.
"But now he's lost control because his fall guy got away, and he's devolving."
His name's Ramon Gomez.
He's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico City.
And he's pretty freaked out.
"Well, that's understandable."
Was he able to give a description of the unsub?
Just of the vehicle.
His English is not good.
We put an APB out.
Hola.
Mi nombre es Emily Prentiss.
Preston campaign headquarters.
This is...
And please tell everybody that I appreciate all of their help.
"Sometimes I don't have a chance to do it personally, so it's really great what they do."
"Hey, uh, Clark, you got a second?"
"""Immediately we met Suzujiro, who was sick in bed. """
Is he Grandma's elder brother?
"""Suzujiro looked better than we had anticipated."
"""He was so pleased that he held our hands tightly..."
"""and did not want to let go for quite some time."
"""But he was very disappointed that Grandma did not come."
"""He repeatedly asked us what was wrong with her..."
"""and we didn't know how to answer him."
"""Since Grandma had said no..."

- Going to...
- To Hawaii.
"""I also think it's a good idea."

That's right!

You think we're being bugged?
[Beeping stops]
"We aren't sure exactly what or who we're looking for out here, so I figured, we can't be sure who's looking for us."
"So, what tripped the alarm?"
Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.
"[Beeps, whirring]"
"[Beeping] Ah, ha ha ha."
I'll be damned.
Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.
Mm.
[Sighs]
Hello.
Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter to the watch's battery.
"You think it's CIA, left over from my Thailand mission?"
Possible.
Doubt we'll ever know for sure.
Can't we track down where it was purchased?
No.
"I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible."
"But we have to try, right?"
"I mean, it's why we're here."
[Knock on door]
Kendall.
Wow.
You certainly have baited the hook.
"I had to, especially considering it's gonna be two against one tonight."
What are you talking about?
"Come on, Rick."
I know you're gonna sneak into Austin's house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him.
"I'm no fool, but you are if you think your little plan will work without these."
Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.
Where'd you get those?
I have Pyrellic poisoning.
Sleer's doing.
There is an antidote that prevents the poison's spreading.
"As long as I take it daily I get no worse, but Sleer, of course, controls my supply."
- So long as you manufacture Pylene-50.
- That is the threat always over my head.
To work for Sleer or to die in agony.
"But, from time to time,"
"Commissioner Sleer comes in here to taunt me, to gloat."
"Now, thanks to my outdated nitroglycerine, Dayna,"
I am ready.
I hope Leitz comes as well.
He usually does.
- Leitz.
- Almost as vile a sadist as Sleer.
"Yes, I should like Leitz to be here."
Is something wrong?
But Leitz told us he worked for the resistance.
"But he didn't tell us about that booby-trap door, did he?"
"And he must have set Hunda up, too."
"That story about the monorail tunnel, it's all a trap."
We've got to tell Hunda and warn him.
"Forbus, we came here to get a sample of Pylene-50 in the hope that someone can devise..."
"Somebody already has, Tarrant."
"These block the effects of Pylene-50, but unfortunately can't reverse them."
And this is the written formula.
- Forbus...
"- Don't waste time thanking me, my friends."
You must hurry.
"- Flight commander wants clearance to launch, sir."
"- All right, go ahead."
"Strike leader, this is Control."
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
And no more car privileges.
"All along I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return, as your Major Sinclair can confirm."
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shootout."
The shootout?
"No, no, no, no, no."
Although there is still a fatal traffic incident about which we must question Mr Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes."
But complications do occur.
"- Hmm, may I visit him?"
"- Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
"As for Mr Stonebridge and Mr Crawford, tomorrow we will send troops into the desert."
I only pray we find them before the bandits who have his daughter.
"It would be deeply regrettable if all my men brought back, were their two corpses."
"Rest assured, Minister, that if none of them make it back, then the photographs they took at the exchange"
will tell a story that I think most of us would rather keep private.
"Thank you, Minister."
Major.
"Yeah, I've got your back."
Move.
- What is it?
- Arakee.
Drink.
And then we shall eat.
"Come on, get it together."
Do you wish to know how much your father thinks you are worth?
I have no father.
You are all of his world.
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.
- Who?
- In accounting.
"You know, that Mr. Sandover whose dumpy little wife used to be Mr. Devro's boss lady."
- In accounting?
- He's been with us almost 20 years.
Mr. Sellers says he's the only man in the company who's never had an expense-account trip.
"All right, all right."
"You're the #1 spark plug now, so spin the wheels, roll 'em down the runway."
"Your necktie is crooked, Mr. Banks."
"[door opens, closes]"
Sandover?
Sandover!
Sandy?
Sandy?
"White paper, three reams;"
"yellow, two;"
"ledger books, seven."
Now let's see.
"I have one full box of black pencils, four red, one, two, three extra pen fillers, seven air-mail stamps, and a full roll of 4¢."
"Sandy, old boy, what in the name of--"
Level of my sherry is precisely at the top of the letter S.
"Sandover, why the devil don't you answer?"
"Shh, Mr. Sellers, we're busy counting paperclips."
And let me warn you-- if a single one is missing when my desk buddy returns--
"All right, never mind."
"Here, Sandy, you won't need this."
I'm having a briefcase loaded with all the estimates.
"Yes, I expected that, sir."
"I'm taking along some work of my own, that's all."
Oh.
"Well, if you're a little overweight on the plane..."
"I plan to travel by rail, sir."
He already told you he doesn't know anything.
No.
You're the one that said that.
He hasn't asked a damn question.
"Look, I know it doesn't look good, but there's not a law against having a dead snitch in your trunk."
So that's why you killed him?
Because he was a snitch?
"Yeah, that's it."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I killed him, I threw him in my trunk, and then I called you guys."
God damn.
"Be real, man."
"Look, he has an alibi."
All right?
All you have to do is call Donald Cooperman.
That's it.
"We called, and his assistant says he doesn't want to get involved."
"Great, but you still have the photos that show that he was serving Cooperman a subpoena at the exact time that this guy was getting stabbed and put in my client's trunk."
- This guy.
- That's right.
What time was that?
Uh--
You said you knew the exact time.
- Did I?
- We don't know the exact time that this guy was stabbed.
Cool.
Neither do I.
But I would like to know why are there people sticking dead bodies in your client's trunk.
"To frame him, obviously."
We have motive.
Karl Stoltz was investigating two of your clients on a drug deal.
You want me to give you some more motive?
You're neither and I don't think I like it.
Another drink?
"You pride yourself on it, don't you?"
It's important to you.
Very important.
What?
Being brave all the time.
Loads of physical courage.
"What is this, truth or consequences?"
"You're quite right, let it pass."
I didn't know you were interested.
"It's purely academic, I assure you."
You don't look academic to me.
"Mr McKendrick, it may interest you to know that a great many women are not partial to the superman type."
They prefer a little human weakness.
A little humility.
Look everybody's scared of something.
That coming from you could be quite an admission.
I gather you two gentlemen know each other.
"Pinky, this is Mr McKendrick."
Pleased to meet you.
"Sit down, McKendrick."
Here is the news.
It was announced from Washington today that President Roosevelt has transferred 50 American destroyers to His Majesty's government as part of a Lend Lease grant.
Lend Lease.
"In exchange, leases have been to the United States for the construction of airfields and naval bases in British Commonwealth Territory as part of America's Defence Programme."
Defence.
What are the Yanks defending?
Who's shooting at them?
That's right.
50 stinking tin cans.
Lousy old tubs that ain't been at sea since WW1.
Okay.
Here he comes.
Tonight I'm offering a reward of $2 million for any information leading to my wife's safe return.
Go in tight.
I urge anyone with information to call the 800 number issued by the FBI.
I would...
"For the sake of my family, for the sake of Sara's family,"
just please...
Please give her back.
Senator!
Senator!
"And that was Senator Jeffrey Collins speaking from his home in Buckhead, Georgia."
The disappearance of his wife Sara has aroused national attention.
"Judy, does the FBI have any leads in this investigation?"
"Well, Jeff, all we know is, Senator Collins' ex-wife, Jessica Nevins, is being sought as a person of interest."
Officials now confirm she was registered at the Biltmore Hotel on the night of the current Mrs. Collins' disappearance.
Officials urge anyone with information to contact the Sara Collins hotline immediately.
"Thanks, Jeff."
"All right, thank you, Judy."
That was Judy Nash...
"Cap, forget about it."
It's not her.
"Messages of support and concern have been flooding in from around the country, as Sara Collins' disappearance approaches the 48-hour mark."
WCN has been covering the story since...
Sara Collins hotline.
Yeah.
I have information about the missing woman.
What is the nature of this information?
I know her.
Or I knew her.
But she had a different name:
Nicky Johnson.
Why should I wait for that?
- Did you find anything?
- Searching the containers takes time.
- Then hire more people.
- It's not people we need.
We're still negotiating with a few less-than-cooperative shipping companies.
- Just solve the problem.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
I've spoken to the Board.
"Everyone wishes you the best, but we have no managing director, prices are dropping, rumours are rife."
"They can voice their complaints to me, otherwise, just do as I ask."
"I'm paying you to do as I ask, so, do it!"
That wasn't necessary.
- Here's the TV script.
- Thank you.
Neither the nanny nor Cart and Emilie's teachers have heard of the gap.
Isn't it just a game they've made up?
- Are they ready'?
- Yes.
The police called.
They advise against doing it.
No.
Come.
You can help save Emilie's life.
- I'm sure your voters will forgive you.
- I've already answered questions.
"As you know, Emilie's kidnapping is closely tied to an old murder case, which your friend, Assistant Public Prosecutor Schuitz was responsible for."
"I was appalled by the whole story, but I have explained our meeting."
- According to a witness...
- The meeting was about Louise Hjelby.
Seifert is totally unreliable.
Is he really the cause of this meeting?
"What are you talking about, for Christ's sake?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"There haven't been more than 1 00 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there.
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.
In other words: normal.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
I mean to L.A.
"No, I...."
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
"When I touch your forehead, open your eyes."
"Are you comfortable, Regan?"
Hello?
"Well, not to be impolite, but, you know, sometimes a gal will be kissin' around on, like, the area near your genitals, but not quite on your genitals."
Makes me ticklish and insecure.
"You know, not to be impolite, but sometimes a gal will do some kissin' on the ears, which makes me uncomfortable, because even though I clean my ears, sometimes a tater will just roll out of there unexpected."
(CHUCKLES)
I kind of likes both those things.
"Yeah, it's why you're called ""Squirrely Dan."""
"Yeah, reason fuckin' five million."
"Well, nots to be impolite, but..."
This gal suggested that maybe I should have some attentions paid
to my butts hole.
That ever...
Ever happen to you guys?
Did you ever have a gal suggest that you need some attentions paid
to your butts holes?
"I'll take that as a hard no, I guess?"
She put a couple of fingers up there and...
It turns out you got a...
An erogenous zone up there.
Found...
Found the hot button and...
"Gaves it a tickle and, uh..."
Yeah.
"Feels, uh..."
"It feels pretty good, you guys, okay?"
- Pop fly.
- I really liked it.
It felt...
Felt very natural.
Nice.
That's how you get the body in front of it.
- Get the body in front of it.
"- They call it ""milking the prostate."""
You were really there to meet this traveler that veritas wanted to protect.
"I remember everything, dad."
those are the memories of a small boy in shock trying to cope with the trauma of a meteor shower.
A trauma brought on by my own father!
My life changed forever that day.
You sacrificed me for the traveler.
why?
"Who is it, dad?"
Who is it?
What if I told you now that you are you traveler?
You're right.
Your life truly changed that day.
I told you in the helicopter that you were destined for a great future.
"That's why I've been so hard on you, trained you so relentlessly."
"Think, lex."
Think.
You have survived mortal injuries so many times.
How else can you explain it?
Because I was trained never to accept defeat.
"When I get my hands on that box in zurich,"
I have a feeling all my questions will be answered.
I know how strong it is...
The attraction of the dark power.
But it will destroy you.
I can't let you go down that terrible path.
You must not open that box.
I can't open it...
Because I need a second key.
Give it to me.
I've swept every possible place you could have hidden it.
And I finally realized there's only person you would trust it with.
Yourself.
"Come on, snap!"

"You should see a doctor, Arthur."
Too much sand in the lungs.
That's the real curse of the pharaohs.
I'll be fine once we're away from Egypt.
I shall miss it dreadfully.
(Soldier shouting orders)
Monsieur Carter.
I am sorry that it has come to this.
I must ask you for the key to the tomb.
The refusal to work is in contravention of the terms of the concession.
My department will now take responsibility and overall control of the tomb and the excavation.
You mean you're kicking me out?
"I warned you, Monsieur Carter."
I've already spoken with the minister.
He's in full agreement with me.
"The key, if you please."
"The soldiers were hardly necessary, you know."
"Have I done the right thing, Arthur?"
You did what you believed to be right.
(Phone ringing)
Carter.
OPERATOR:
"Mr Carter, I have Monsieur Lacau for you from Cairo."
HOWARD:
The situation in Egypt has changed.
The nationalist campaign of violence has backfired.
The government are concerned.
The hotel trade is vital to them and they're worried about losing tourists.
Lacau is keen to reopen the tomb.
But he needs an international team to do it and he's asked me to go back.
"Under his proposal,"
I see that I remain responsible for the costs of the excavation.
You put it on a meridian of the ear to quit smoking.
My mom tried everything.
Then I'm almost certain it didn't belong to the vic.
His lungs were pink as a baby's.
"Alas, his spine was not in such pristine condition."
"Same marks as on the flesh, but it looks like some sort of thermal burn on the bone."
Kinetic energy.
Whatever the killer used to dismember the body was starting to heat up.
So he must have dismembered the too last.
That explains why we only found burns there.
I also discovered trace in the victim's chest hair.
Looks like sawdust.
"Sawdust.Between that and the thermal burning on the bone,"
I'm thinking some kind of chainsaw.
But what type of chainsaw leaves jagged wounds like this?
ÇúÃû:
I Need To Know ¸èÊÖ:
Marc Anthony
Mind if I cut in?
Prostitution?
"Come on, Ms.Love, I got a rap sheet here says you've been arrested four times for solicitation."
"I'll see you next week, George."
"Mm-hmm, okay."
"This isn't what you think, Detective."
"This isn't what you think either, Ms. Love."
I'm not Vice.
I'm with Homicide.
And we have your fingerprint on this acupressure disc.
I bought one of those to quit smoking.
I lost it.
"Well, we found it near this guy."
You know him?
I know that I say that I could make a haul worldwide delicious parking in the city.
But I am not a good God
"I am his secretary, all."
One more thing.
I am not as those of your world.
Come.
Did I leave it where you want.
Tell him that your friend Minister
I clean up the city by yourself?
Who defend the law against the law?
"Instigate those carrion against each other, is an art ... seldom rewarded."
"Then, about a medal?"
I tell everything.
I can not leave you more closely.
A sweet?
Do not swallow the pit.
You still lack one last detail.
"Marie, I found less than one year."
I am his father.
"Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,"
"Albania, Egypt, the war!"
"Albania, war!"
"Egypt, Nicaragua!"
I often dream this strange and shocking for a woman unknown and I love and who loves me ...
"Do not miss this tender time, sweetness to be or not be ... because I have lived nell'attendere and my heart was not that your hand."
"Be wise, my pain, stay more calm."
"Relied on the evening falls, here it is."
"A dark envelops the city bringing about a peace, to those who worry the ..."
It is from within hours with the dog.
I do not want to disconnect?
"Do not open more eyes, does not say anything."
Try to shake shit.
Two feds and an unnamed party.
"Got to be a foreign leader, protected witness or fugitive."
All possible targets for someone.
That changing flights at Dulles would be a vulnerable moment and the killer's one chance to exact revenge.
"It's a great catch, Abbs."
"They're escorting Hector Gomez, a high-level member of Cartel Dominguez."
Wanted for the murder of a rival cartel dealer.
"Gomez was captured hiding out in Wales, of all places."
Colombian authorities were extraditing him this morning.
"That outgoing flight to Bogotá, do we have a manifest?"
There isn't one yet.
Must have been a private charter.
Who in that terminal is Colombian?
"Tell me about recent trips to South America, e-mails, anything."
Cross-referencing DEA and CIA.
That's a needle in a haystack.
A haystack controlled by the world's most dangerous drug cartel.
"Hey, so, are those your fancy flying pajamas, or just your everyday casuals?"
"Dude, I'm not getting re-screened."
Uh-huh.
Why's that?
What...
Don't.
That's not mine.
Go get re-screened.
Dude.
"Um, it's the London flight, Tony."
Our killer is waiting for it.
Who's the target?
Hector Gomez.
Who?
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now de-boarding at gate 212."
Ask him.
"More incredible, he now places the body under a street light."
"Would you do that, Mr Shrimpton?"
"If, in the terribly unlikely event you were to have killed somebody, would you do a runner, or would you take 15 precious minutes to drag the body so that you could place it under a street lamp"
in full view of the street?
"Hey, listen, I haven't killed no-one."
"You've just confessed to the court, Mr Shrimpton, of a Clintonesque interlude with a minor."
"Have you been charged with this offence, Mr Shrimpton?"
No.
Really?
"Have you done another grubby deal with the police, Mr Shrimpton?"
Objection!
I withdraw it.
"Thank you, Your Honour."
That was better than sex.
"Then you're not trying hard enough, cock."
I've gotta make way for another couple of beers.
"Congratulations, your name in the papers yet again."
WOMAN:
Good result.
"Lorton did do it, you know?"
"Well, then, you should have made a better case, mate."
Couldn't.
Hands were tied.
There you go.
You know how your bloke did time for that statutory rape?
"Yeah, he was 19, she was 16."
It was bullshit.
Exactly.
"I kept asking myself how it ever made it to court, so I checked."
Turns out your boy slashed the girl with a knife.
Both breasts.
I'm angry.
I thought it would be a nice surprise if you showed up and saw a friendly face.
"I confided in you, and you took advantage of me."
- Do you know how humiliating this is?
- You don't need to feel humiliated.
I am wearing a silicone ass!
I knew there was something different.
You know what?
"No, no, no."
I don't appreciate your jokes.
I thought you were a decent human being...
Kitty.
Hear me out.
I just felt terrible that you went through all this because my staff made assumptions.
- So you hijacked my date?
- I didn't trust Elise to find anybody good enough for you.
"And rather than have you sit through some awkward meal with a stranger and me at home with my laptop and takeout Thai, I hijacked your date."
- I thought you'd find it charming.
- Charming?
Accept my apology.
"My intentions were noble, albeit my execution was..."
"Lame, ill-conceived, thoughtless?"
"All of the above, yes."
Look.
I can't date you.
I know.
But maybe you could share some red wine and a steak with me as a friend.
Do you have your speech with you?
You want to turn this into a working dinner?
"Yeah, I do."
I think it would make me feel better.
- I already memorized it.
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"-Of course, sir."
My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying to do here.
ARCHER:
I guess I have myself to blame.
ARCHER:
"In the past, I've encouraged them to ask questions... but we don't have time for that now."
I need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders.
"It won't be a problem, sir."
ARCHER:
I thought what happened with T'Pol... might have been an isolated incident but I'm not so sure now.
Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship that could have helped us.
I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission.
You're in command while I'm on the surface.
You answer to me and me alone.
"Is that understood, Major?"
"-Perfectly, sir."
-That'll be all.
[Solemn instrumental music]
TRIP:
"Can we talk to you, sir?"
ARCHER:
What is it?
I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox.
Do I look sick to you?
Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
That's right.
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?
We'll be light-years from here before the Xindi respond to it.
They do.
They record everyone that comes to the door.
"But it's got such a small hard drive, so, once it's full, it just records over itself."
So it's useless.
"Well, no, not exactly."
Stuff doesn't actually disappear.
It just gets jumbled.
I was able to plug in this facial recognition software to isolate the times that Aldo came to the house.
Is that him?
I can't see it.
"Oh, uh, that's because you're not looking at Aldo."
You're looking at what's behind him.
I'm trying to isolate the car that was following him.
AUBREY:
"Well, that's a few too many times to be a coincidence."
"Yeah, agreed."
Now we just have to figure out who was driving it.
BRENNAN:
Ms. Warren.
You wanted to see me?
"I was reexamining the spinal column, and I found these fractures on the C1 and C2."
They suggest that the vertebrae were severely displaced.
Which indicates a hyperflexion fracture.
The neck was snapped at the C2 vertebra.
That would cause complete paralysis of all muscles below the brain stem.
Yes.
"The lungs cease functioning, resulting in a complete loss of oxygen to the brain."
Cause of death wasn't exsanguination.
It was this fracture.
"Uh, Dr. Brennan."
Yes?
Didn't your father come back into your life after spending years as a fugitive?
"About those pills, they're doubly strong."
I don't want you to use them on him unless you absolutely have to.
Is that clear?
Blake.
Hello.
"Hello, darling."
I'd like you to meet Dr. Travers.
- Doctor.
"- Pleasure, Mr. Carrington."
Doctor came very highly-recommended.
"Well, that's good to know."
I'm happy I had the chance to meet you.
Pleasure.
"Doctor, would you please tell my husband I'm fine?"
"Well, yes, to a certain degree, your wife has a low-grade infection."
"Certainly, nothing to be alarmed about."
But what she needs now is good old-fashioned rest.
I'll see to it she gets plenty of that.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to talk to Mrs. Gunnerson.
"Doctor, are you quite sure that she's all right?"
"I mean, shouldn't she be in bed, resting?"
"Oh, don't worry, sir, I've given her some antibiotics."
"She should take it easy, but bed rest isn't absolutely necessary."
"By the way, do you mind my asking, how are you feeling, sir?"
"- Why, I'm fine."
Why?
- Nothing.
"It's, you know, none of my personal business, but professionally, I know how you corporate types neglect regular check-ups."
Right or wrong?
"Well, unfortunately, you're right about that."
"Well, you certainly look in excellent shape, and I'm sure you are."
"Tell me, what's going on?"
Somebody left a dead body on my doorstep.
There's another vampire in this city.
And it's just getting started.
You moved the body.
Are you out of your mind?
Under the circumstances it made the most sense.
"No, you totally compromised the evidence."
I preserved the body to the best of my ability.
"No, you should have called the police, that's what you should have done."
And that's why I came to you.
You know my life doesn't bear scrutiny.
Isn't your job to serve and protect?
"Actually, I don't think that motto was meant to extend to the undead."
"There's another vampire out there, and this one is killing people."
Detective...
"I need your help, unless you'd rather me handle this on my own."
Okay.
"Fine, what's done is done."
"Let's just move on, shall we?"
What happened?
This is what I know.
The body appeared at my door around 9:00 p.m.
She was already dead.
The neck had been savaged and she was drained of all her blood.
So...what?
This is the vampire equivalent of a gift basket?
It wasn't a present.
Vampires are solitary predators.
It's in our nature.
It keeps us from over populating and depleting our hunting grounds.
He wants my territory.
- Girl's been through enough.
- Fantastic.
"Hey, look on the bright side."
"Dyson found Olivia, and everything will be just fine."
Shit-encrusted maggots.
"Burning, scorching rain."
Flaying skin of rotting sinners.
"- Yeah, we're working on that."
- Don't touch me!
- How is she?
- I'm easing her pain but her brain is in a death spiral.
The prodigal Succubus.
What's your part in this?
She asked me to execute a human and I refused.
"We fought, and her attack, I guess it backfired."
And then someone killed Samir.
I went over to talk to him and he was already dead.
All I saw was Olivia like this.
She ran as soon as she saw me.
Her insanity does explain the messy kill.
I didn't kill my husband.
"I ate his brains with a tarragon sauce, but he did not die!"
That cheating sack of shit taunts me from the other world!
"Attacking a human out of jealousy, murdering your mate?"
Supposed to punish those who break our rules not break them yourself.
"And you, siding with a human over a Fae."
You could not take a more foolish position.
The day is still early.
I'll break the news to Olivia's sisters.
We'll be keeping you under close scrutiny.
"And you, Dyson, let's hope your performance improves."
I'm so sorry.
- Hang on a minute.
The president asked me to join his Cabinet.
He asked me to stall my career with the agreement that he'd help me...
You don't want it.
You're helping yourself.
"If this announcement makes A17 of the Metro section, I'd be surprised."
There's one name on the ballot this November.
"Not yours, not mine, not the governor of New Jersey."
No one will work harder than Jed Bartlet to put you there.
"This president loses reelection, your career is finished, and so is mine."
What's your point?
Next time you announce new policy that isn't cleared we're announcing you're moving back to New Jersey.
- What about the loans?
- C.J. will announce them tomorrow.
Come on.
Let me do it with the president.
It's too small for the president.
I've gotta go back to a meeting.
- Yep.
It was the rebate.
- It wasn't a rebate.
It was an advance.
- You say potato... .
"- I do say potato, so does everybody."
We wanted to inject money into retail and tourism.
Why not wait until people were supposed to have the money?
The economy might have improved on its own by then.
"In which case, it would have been pointless."
- Yeah.
- Economists make it up as they go along.
- Yeah.
- Did it work?
I agree with Raymond.
- Can you blame him for saying that?
- No.
"We can't spend that much money, not on this day... not with this technology."
I can just superimpose them and I Photoshop them on my Mac...
But you'd be cheating yourself and the reader.
I don't think the reader is really gonna know.
The reader knows.
How do I know?
Because I knew!
"Look, I was raised in the trailer part..."
- that won't leave this table.
"- Oh, God!"
But the point is:
I looked foward to... getting my monthly Skirt.
I dropped off right on the trail... to get me just a dollop of gloss and glamour.
"I needed that, so did other millions of teenage girls... ass-wash clad, coming off the arcade."
We needed that.
We wanted hope and fantasy.
- And we want our gargoyles real.
"- Yes, we want real gargoyles..."
Do you understand us?
Real gargoyles!
There's my sweetie.
"Hey, sweetie... sit you cute butt down here."
She's great!
Am I interrupting something?
We are entrenched in this serious debate... about the importance of investing in beauty.
- Have you any thoughts?
- They want to sacrifice... their soul for some change.
Do you want to decide between the budget and truth?
What they're saying is if there should be caps on our shoots.
You've got the truth.
I don't have the truth.
You'd be amazed at how attractive
-- the truth can be sometimes.
-
- Not f or a woman.
-
- You'r e wrong.
-
"- The truth is,"
"I have a job that involves me and stimulates me and r ewards me and takes up a lot of my time, and I'm not willing to do my job just a little bit."
I want to do all of it.
"It's part of me, and I am diff er ent without it, and that is who I am, and that is who you need to love."
-
- Ex cept it won't work.
-
"- Yes, it will."
It won't!
-
- Say it just like that.
-
- It won't.

Kim:
"Five minutes to air, please."
"I'm hangin' with the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost"
"I can tell you what they say, haters, if you wanna know"
They say ooh wee
When I'm rollin' my Mercedes all the ladies wanna roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another ho
"Ooh wee, ooh wee"
- Ooh wee
"- La, la, la, la, la, la-la"
"In the middle of the summer, or even 20 below"
I'm a bad motherfucker I'm way too fuckin' cold
Let me tell you what they say when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooh wee

Ooh wee
"Aiyo, aiyo"
My game's here to party just to cut up a rug
Don't make me have to cut up a thug
"Now play something for me, DJ, 'cause there's nothin' but love"
Hosted by the ladies who looking' for somethin' to rub
Ooh wee
Dude.
"Oh, my Go-- I just realized something."
What?
"Maria's gonna think I'm a stalker, man."
I'm following her to Amsterdam.
"Dude, relax."
I have a med school interview in ten minutes.
You don't see me freaking out.
"Don't worry, man, she'll be psyched to see you."
"Oh, psyched?"
You never scolded me before.
Without me... you got no standing on the market.
"Everywhere, you will get a no"
And what's this?
Do I see anger?
Are you taking it out on the baby?
Change of philosophy?
Love isn't more powerful than money.
"Brothers... one left for America, one for Bangalore"
"You called me a loner, didn't you?"
And how long have I been telling you that brothers never stick together
Brothers together.
"Just verbiage, not in real life"
"Yes honey, coming"
Tanya and I are going to see the architect
We're building a five star hotel in place of your house
"Day after day, trying to piece my life together... resolving to start life anew... but what can I do?"
It all lies in ruins
"With my five-year old son, I wander the streets."
Aimlessly
I told you!
KK-Mix is dead!
Now get out
Have you come to pay me tributes?
"Where are the garlands, the bouquets?"
We'd like to know why you haven't scored an album in four years?
Four years ago...
I was a star.
"I was a thief, I stole songs"
At least I have the satisfaction of not being a thief anymore
That was KK-Mix superhit singer and music director
"No, you haven't come congratulating me... you've come to rub salt into my wounds"
Let's believe in that
She's not the type who would sell her body
"By the way, what kind of prostitution is it?"
"It's not the ""real thing"" but they make you feel good"
"What's ""the real thing""?"
"Um, well that... umm"
"I'm kidding, I know."
Please stop it with your gross reactions
For now I guess it's good
I didn't say it out loud but I was thinking that maybe she was dead
My wish is to meet with Miyu as soon as possible
Right?
Lin?
"Um, yeah"
I'm just gonna take her home anyways
We have some time until 3PM
Let's go to a BL manga shop
Now?
I forgot to get Miyu a gift.
I'm gonna buy her something special
I'll get her that hella-expensive one
We still aren't sure if it's her
We must always be prepared
Always be imaginitive
That's the only way to become strong
You sound like Haruki Murakami
That makes it sound like I'm ripping him off
"As your punishment, you need to pay for that book"
Bon is surprisingly calm
"Yeah, I think it's cause it makes no difference for her"
What do you mean?
"It's hard to say, but even if Miyu did it with a lot of guys..."
"- Hey muscled men, bring me some roasted peanuts."
- Sorry that is not our job
"Then what else is your job, you pig-headed wastrels?"
"- If you stand folding hands, does that make you Arnold?"
- Please hold your tongue.
- What is the use of drinking half a bottle of beer if you can't squabble?
I know monkey kung fu.
- Please sit down.
- Will you bring or not?
- Sit I say
- I sit only to honor your request.
"Sir, your bill."
"Sir, kindly take."
Well how much have they charged?
How could you charge 5000?
"- Sorry sir, this bill belongs to the next table."
"- You saved my life, man"
"- How could you charge 10,000?"
"- Yes sir, this is your bill."
If I had known earlier I would have sat at the nearby table?
Is this a bar or some place of extortion?
"How can you charge 10,000 for a single bottle of beer?"
- Don't you have money?
"- All I have is 10,000"
"And by the way,"
After knowing all this my mother won't relent to our marriage.
Have you to spend your life with me or with my brothers?
"Although the marriage is with you,"
The relation will be with all.
Isn't it?
"Sheen, I am willing to break away every relationship for your sake."
"Faiz, you cannot do this even if you wish to."
Because he threatened me with rain when I wanted it fine.
He found fault with my high flyer and will not buy my brown mare.
If it will be of satisfaction to you. -
- I believe his character to be.
"In all other respects, irreproachable."
"In return for this acknowledgement, don't deny me the privilege -"
- Of disliking him as much as I adore this cottage.
- I have plans for improvements.
- That.
I will never consent to.
Not a stone must be added to its walls.
"Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild Combe Magna to this exact image."
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.
Then I'd be as happy at Combe as I've been at Barton.
But this place has one claim on my affections none other can share.
Promise never to change it.
I'm honoured you risk your honour by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.
"Miss Marianne, will you grant me an interview tomorrow... alone?"
"- Willoughby, we are always alone."
- But there is...
There is something very particular I should like to ask you.
Of course.
I shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.
Thank you.
Until tomorrow.
Then.
Oh.
Virtue...
"Silently and with fear, enter the hearts of all that hear me this day."
There's been a complaint about Georgie's living conditions and welfare.
Can you believe what we just did?
That was completely awesome.
"Ty Borden, Amy Flemming, you're under arrest for horse theft."
- Horse theft?
- You heard the officer.
How can you arrest us for horse theft?
You should arrest this guy.
He's the one who stole the herd off Will Vernon.
They're wild horses!
They don't belong to will or anybody else.
I'm completely within my rights.
"Yeah, but you trespassed on Will's land to get them in the first place."
Mr. Pincher has a government permit.
He's allowed by law to capture any wild horses in this area.
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Return the horses to his corral or I will have to put you under arrest.
I can't believe this.
It's a notice of investigation from the...
- child protection society.
They're...
- Shhh!
They're setting up an appointment with us for tomorrow.
Oh my God.
"There's a litany of complaints here, Lou."
Look!
"""Child works on the farm for three hours both before and after school."
Could constitute child labour.
An alleged...
An alleged accident occurred while the child was unsupervised.
"This could be deemed as possible child abuse and neglect."""
"Peter, this is all lies."
We'll just have some fun.
Help your brother a little bit.
You sneaky person...
Here are the answer keys.
"I've made two copies, just in case."
When do we sneak in?
Tomorrow.
On Career Day caricaturist Yigit Ozgur will be here.
"Everyone, including the headmaster, will be in the conference hall."
We'll sneak into the room at that time.
"To become a caricaturist, what major am supposed to choose for the exam?"
"As far as I know, there is no major like that in the universities."
"If there were, I would have been studying there now... but if you must decide on a major"
Hello?
What's the situation like?
Be very careful because Rafet is not around.
Okay.
We are going down.
Okay.
See you later.
Uluc said that Rafet isn't around.
"If he comes out from somewhere, we will be screwed."
Don't be scared.
God knows where he is or what he is after.
"Besides, if you're not caught red handed, you can't be considered guilty."
I said stop.
Slow down a little bit.
I passed the last exit before the bridge.
One minute.
Weren't you supposed to make an album for me with the extra... money from the parent teacher association?
Weren't you going to back me up and be my producer?
I will.
James Barr's lawyers might pull their boy through.
"I know, sir, Inspector Frost..."
Is off the case.
Remember it.
This place is in chaos.
They're shifting CID out en masse.
What they're doing is setting up is a station within a station.
No one is to go in there.
Including me.
"Not very good for Denton's image is it, sir?"
The image of the station is not my chief concern right now.
What about you?
What have you done about representation?
Someone from the Federation maybe?
A solicitor perhaps?
No that's not my style.
"Jack, try and keep your style..."
Under control?
"I don't always like the way you do things but whatever our disagreements,"
I have the highest regard for your integrity.
And I shall be making that clear at the highest level.
"Don't try too hard, sir."
(Knock on door)
Yes!
"Mr. Mullett, I'd like to make a start, with Inspector Frost."
"Yes, superintendent?"
I am concerned that Inspector Frost has no communication with any officers here.
Are you telling me that when one of my senior officers is suspended
I can't speak to him?
It makes it tidier.
"Let me remind you, Superintendent, that this is my station."
"I have a responsibility for the people who work here, and I intend to ensure that"
"Absolutely clear and simple, You guys get it?"
No!
What do you understand?
"I am saying that press the remote,"
"What will explode, it has a bomb,"
"Sir, I think this is the best idea, Press it, press it."
"Ones, Twos, Threes."
You're insulting me from morning.
Is there any bomb or he's just telling us to press.
"No, Sir."
"There is a bomb inside, I saw it from my eyes."
"But it doesn't explodes, He made it,"
"Hold it, Show me the remote,"
"You place plus up and minus down, the how could it explode?"
"It must be opposite,"
"Turn minus on to plus, cover it."
"And say, One, Two, Three,"
"Papa, it explodes."
"It doesn't explode, It doesn't explode,"
"You're insulting me from morning, insult in car, insult in society,"
"I am a Dons, I am a Dons, insults on the front of these girls."
I will...
Hey...
Rangeela Ratan Jackie Shroff!
"Silence,"
"You' re beating to the front of all,"
If battery is not working then what is my fault?
If we check to open the bag then It isn't better?
"It's better, Not better,"
"It is not a matter of bomb explode, It about respect."
"Now until bomb won't explode... till then give me this gun,"
Give me the gun otherwise I'll shoot.
I love you both.
We love you too.
But this is something you cannot share with us.
Something I can't share with you ?
I loved you when everyone else wanted you dead.
"Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand."
It's not personal.
It's transcendent.
It's like what you said.
It's transcendent.
"Pray for us, Caprica."
We'll be praying for you.
"Okay, he wants us to set up forward observation posts hard-wired back to base for communications."
"The ops are gonna be staggered at strategic locations, giving us as much warning as possible, if there is a cylon advance."
"Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point."
"Oh, joy."
"Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage."
"Fly to the closest observation post, have them relay the information back to command."
"Be sure to note force strength, direction of march, and position."
"I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant."
"Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here."
Hanek and Deetco you go here.
- And who gets lucky number 3 ?
"- That would be Sergeant Fisher, and me."
"Do you have a problem with that, Captain ?"
- No.
- We go in an hour.
"Green base, foxfire 1."
"Green base, foxfire 1."
We are open for business.
Over.
Son of a bitch.
That should have been me.
- It was my idea.
- Igin volunteered.
I should never have sent him.
He was too old.
"But that's why he volunteered, Hunda, don't you see?"
- He wanted to be of use.
"- Nevertheless, it was my idea, I should have gone!"
"Yes, sir, with any luck the rebel's Fourth Column has just ceased to exist."
- Well done.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Mind you, I have a sneaking respect for these Helots."
I led a squadron of them once.
"Marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
They love the hand-to-hand stuff.
"Not really necessary, of course, these days, sir."
"Don't you believe it, Quute."
You can't do everything with your missiles.
"Bunkers, strong points, inner city combat."
You've got to winkle them out with cold steel.
It's the only way of clearing the ground.
"- Gas, sir?"
- It's not always effective.
- Do you remember the Fletch expedition of '29?
"- No, I don't think I do."
Fletch used gas against the Wazis.
"Complete massacre, bodies everywhere."
"Took dinner with his officers that night, suddenly the Wazis came over the wall, butchered the whole expedition."
"It seems Wazis are gill-breathers, they can lie dormant for days."
"That's very interesting, sir."
- You'll send out a patrol to do a body count?
"- Of course, sir."
He's not allowed to.
"Now it's no longer necessary, he doesn't need it."
He doesn't masturbate.
Only when I give him permission.
"When the horn sounds the hunt, And mama feels an itch in front"
And papa grows a hard-on.
Spring will soon warm the garden.
The bedroom is the zone for tenderness.
It's where I get my tenderness.
"I mean, I am a woman."
I like snuggling too.
"Being caressed, getting tenderness."
That's what's... so great about our relationship.
I can get exactly what I want.
So this is the zone for tenderness.
"Outside, in the living room and other rooms, it's more the zone for domination."
"When I want to be really dominant with him, I take him to the basement."
Because the basement is arranged in accordance with my ideas.
My love slave was permitted to build it.
It's the extremely dominant zone.
I'm very dominant there.
Open it.
Close the door.
This is my tool cabinet with all its different items.
For example.
different sizes of butt plugs.
"Here's the metal one, which I really like."
"Because of the material, its coolness."
It allows a range of possibilities for stretching the rectum.
"Quite wide, in fact."
A lovely little toy.
I also have different kinds of dildos.
Carter Hall.
"There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time."
- What about...
"- Kendra, yes, we need your assistance in locating her and Savage."
Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.
"He said something about, um..."
Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians were race of extraterrestrials.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.
"Captain, I have surveillance footage which might be relevant."
"Thank you, Gideon."
I've seen that rock before.
Savage had one of those in 1958.
He took our blood.
"He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C."
- What are you doing?
"- Come on, man."
We got to try it again.
That thing that we did in World War II.
- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.
"It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning."
"Come on, just the once."
Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?
"I don't know, I just found this junk lying around."
"Oh, come on."
Don't you think that turning something into something else might come in handy?
"All right, one time only."
"Okay, just the once."
All right.
"You need to focus, Jefferson."
"OK, Michelangelo,"
I have decided to use these disasters and rethink everything.
Yes.
They want me to revise my collection?
Overnight?
"OK, I will give them a collection that they will never forget."
Yes.
"I will, I will... wrap everything, cover it, and I will call it my burkha collection."
"Yes, and then I will rip everything to shreds as if a burkha was hit by a bomb."
"This is East/West, you see, in one."
"Brilliant, no?"
"But my backer, my business manager, my public relations people, they all will say no."
Why should I listen to their opinions?
"Because, Michelangelo, they control the finance."
"Therefore, they only think about what will sell."
What will sell a perfume.
"Second, they are afraid it might offend."
They don't want to upset people.
People like me.
Not because they care about our feelings but because they are afraid of us.
Do you understand?
"And, suddenly, my designs, they must attract people under 12!"
What are they thinking of?
"Suddenly, my designs must attract children?"
"I mean, children!"
"No offence to you, Michelangelo."
I mean no offence to you.
I am very fond of children.
"I was once a child, too, but not for long."
"You have to grow up fast where I came from, very fast."
"Yes, Michelangelo, a very successful meeting."
Sometimes you just have to be firm with designers.
- If you' re admitting her to Psych.
- She may have a reason-
Just got word on Mr. Chambers.
Aortic dissection.
I'm taking him up to Surgery now...
- ... unless you have objections.
- No.
Would it be possible for us to speak in private first?
- Of course.
- Dr. Weaver?
- Later.
"- Yeah, but I need..."
I wanted to talk to you about what happened earlier.
"Oh, for God's sake!"
Who left a cadaver in here?
Sasha's a bit of a bad penny.
She keeps being moved while they try to locate her family.
I don't mind if you don't mind.
I'm concerned that you might be taking on too much too soon particularly in the area of trauma.
Based on?
What I saw earlier.
A pronounced inability to work with others.
A lack of professional respect.
"You' re joking, right?"
"Look, it's stressful, no question."
Copping an attitude with me and my staff is not gonna make a trauma go any easier.
"Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta."
"In fact, it only adds to the intense pressure that we' re all feeling."
"Given my position, I didn't think it necessary to seek your approval."
We all have our sensitivities.
"Quite frankly, if anyone has an attitude here, it's you."
- But we can't let them interfere-
"The medicine cured him, Jacob."
- Not faith healing.
- That's your version.
Mine is that I experienced God's love moving through me to Larry.
"Now, wait a minute."
Aren't faith healers frowned upon in judaism?
Religious dogma is meaningless in the face of God's new revelations!
I have a power to heal!
And more than that...
I understand things.
You are missing something from your life.
Perhaps it is God's grace.
May we pray together?
"That's a very lovely offer, but... no, thank you."
"So, we have all of Jacob's test results back."
He's completely healthy.
No.
He's barking mad.
"You know, I bet they said that about Joan of Arc."
"Just because we don't share in Jacob's faith, it doesn't mean that it's a condition, right?"
"Just out of curiosity, does anyone in this room believe in God?"
Have you seen me operate?
- I am God.
- Mm.
I believe in God.
- She's awesome.
"- I am a scientist, and I am trained to equate truth with things that can be proven."
"Not only does faith ask you to accept things that are impossible to prove, it's just they defy all reason."
But isn't that the very definition of faith?
That you believe without proof?
Then why not believe in leprechauns or unicorns?
"Santa Claus, bigfoot."
See where you can run to
who are you?
I am one who hates being aroused from sleep
Old lady Jin Hwa
So you are the old witch who killed 68 men in Lin Jiang restaurant in one night
You want to die?
You again
I wanted to kill those who woke me up but ended up saving you fool
"Thanks, I'll repay you someday wait"
"Chu Er, you must be bored being alone here"
I'll let him stay to serve you
"I have to go, you stay and practise with her"
I want you to catch 1 0 poisonous spiders for her daily
Hear that?
"Sorry, but I have to go"
I have to see my grand teacher because I only have two more years to live if I don't return I won't see him again
I don't care you have to stay here
"Chu Er, practise hard when I get the sword I'll return to you"
Okay
Granny
"Miss, I have some business"
I can't accompany you
"when I say you can't go, you can't what's your name?"
Let go
You call Ah Niu?
"Let me go, alright?"
what?
You were a cow herd
why do you bite me?
Get lost
It's painful
Do you have any pain killer?
I wonder who she was.
"Oh, don't start thinking things like that."
"because that's the thing he was saying, that..."
"Funny enough... it looks like a model, do you know what I mean?"
It doesn't look real.
Do you get that feeling?
It doesn't look like a real human being.
Wow.
I feel compelled to look and look and look and look and look.
"Apparently the eye is a third real, a third glass, and all... the eyelashes are two-thirds real."
every single other thing is completely real.
Lady Devonport takes the lead!
Don't push me!
The seat needs to be about here.
"Well, these were built by dangerous people"
"As the Regency House science event gathers momentum,"
Mr. Foxsmith introduces another innovation to the party... the velocipede.
It was the custom of men of fashion to show off by strutting about on contraptions like these.
"Right, who's going to win this race?"
I don't know...
"Actually, I think Mr. Everett."
I pick Carrington to win.
Do you?
"Well, I think Everett to win."
My money's on Everett on this one.
Do you reckon?
both contenders have a history of dislike for each other.
"Rivals for the affections of Miss Hopkins,"
Everett and Carrington are set to battle it out
It's a two-horse race...
anything could happen.
"Come on, pedal."
Unlock the control conduit.
"Tuvok, Torres, please respond."
Keep an eye on the flow rate.
"Yes, sir."
Rate's holding steady.
The reaction rate is stabilized at 13 percent.
Up to 15...18.
It worked then.
We're all right?
Maybe.
"Once the rate is up to normal, we'll try getting the warp drive back on line."
Then we'll see if there was any damage.
Begin rerouting power back to all key systems.
What happened down there?
"I don't know, exactly."
"I went in the shop, completed the trade, then I heard weapons fire on the street."
"By the time I got out there, the Captain and the others were gone."
Are you sure it was the Mokra?
I spoke to witnesses on the street.
They said it was quite a fight.
Any idea how the Mokra knew you were down there?
Someone must have told them we were coming.
The Mokra have informants everywhere.
Could your contact be one of them?
I don't think I would have made it back here with the tellerium if he had been.
"Besides, he's involved with the Alsaurian resistance movement."
He would never help the Mokra.
They've probably got the resistance movement under surveillance.
Commander.
I think we're ready to give the engines a try.
I'm opening the plasma injectors.
Warp engines are back on line.
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
My work.
SAROYAN:
W-We can handle this.
You should be home.
"Yeah, at the very least, you shouldn't be watching this."
"It must have been terrible, huh?"
It was unpleasant.
And losing the opportunity to examine vital evidence makes it more so.
Right.
"Well, I uploaded the photos that you sent."
My theory is that Aldo Clemens died on that table.
"Why torture him so horribly, but end it with a relatively quick, humane death?"
Maybe he got the information he wanted.
Maybe.
"But there's a cruelty to this killer, it doesn't fit."
BRENNAN:
I agree.
Cause of death was a transected cervical spinal cord.
We need to understand how that was done.
"Okay, well, all we have is a bloodstained table and a few strips of duct tape."
I have enhanced the stains here.
"Well, the largest concentration of blood will be where the rat cage was fixed to the ribs."
Can you align the body accordingly?
"Yeah, I'll center the stain on the eighth and ninth rib."
The remaining tape matches up with the arms and legs.
"Uh, this doesn't make sense."
The skull would need more range of motion for the spinal column to be transected.
"Okay, let me recreate the fracture to the C2."
SAROYAN:
You're right.
These etching lines?
"They symbolize rays that the Laurel wreath encircles, in the center of which would sit a silver star."
Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea?
No.
"He thought he deserved one, though."
"Fired off a lot of angry letters to uncle Sam while he was, you know, in jail."
Got denied every time.
So maybe this is payback.
Instead of ball bearings or nails.
Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?
A real one?
"Well, you wouldn't."
"What about, like, Craigslist?"
"Not from a military family I take it, sir."
Silver star is the third-highest combat military decoration.
"If it's not left to the family, most are buried with the soldiers."
The Presidio.
- Graveyard detail.
"- Thank you, sir."
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
My suspect worked the graveyard detail here at the Presidio from 1952 to '54 during his court-martial.
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried, right?"
"Silver stars, Korean war?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.
I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
You did print my picture without permission on your libelous Web site.
I'm the friend of Chad Berry.
"- Oh, you're that dude."
"- Yeah, I'm that dude."
I'm just looking for the dish on Berry.
"If you want to spill, I could..."
"No, no."
You misunderstand.
I'm an attorney.
And I demand that you cease and desist publishing uncorroborated information about his personal life.
"Hey, man, what can I say?"
Inquiring minds want to know.
He's contemplating filing a complaint.
The cause of action:
"Invasion of privacy, libel, unfair business practices, infliction of emotional distress."
- Should I go on?
- But you're not denying Berry's gay?
"Listen to me, son, and I'll say this in a way that you understand."
"If you don't stop targeting my client, I will bury you so deep in litigation, it will be your great-great-grandchildren paying off the legal bills."
Do I make myself clear?
"Yeah, I get it."
You made your point.
Good.
Then thank you so much for your time.
"Hey, Mom."
What's wrong?
"Kevin, what are you doing?"
"Please, please, tell me exactly what you were thinking, because I'm quite sure we all agreed we would not say a thing!"
"- You agreed, Saul!"
- Kevin.
I didn't want it to happen the way it did.
I'm sorry.
It is a request.
You must take up where you left off.
The poisonings continue.
They must be stopped once and for all.
"They can be and they shall be, Sire, but on one condition."
That I trust your judgment?
"Yes, Sire."
I have always trusted your judgement.
It was my own that fell by the wayside.
The King is easily influenced.
"We must act quickly, before she twists his mind back in her favor."
What does Her Majesty propose?
He listens neither to you nor to me.
"Madame Scarron, what do you say?"
I believe we are good when we are surrounded by good people.
"Yes, I find it hard to believe that"
His Majesty can be so easily influenced by a woman.
It depends on the woman.
"We must place someone else in his life, someone chaste and devout, who will show him the path of moderation."
But who?
I'm not sure I understand.
Madame Scarron will befriend him and influence him with her modesty and piety
And impress upon him the benefits of marriage and fidelity.
I'm fear you overestimate my abilities.
Perhaps it's you that underestimates them?
Do this for me and for the King.
Do you accept?
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty..."
Do you accept?
No murder comes without a cost.
Never a truer word spoken.
What do you make of it?
"I ask you again, sir, here and now under oath... were you at any time a member of a crime organization"
led by michael corleone?
I don't know nothing about that!
I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.
We have a sworn affidavit.
"Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered on the orders of michael corleone."
"Do you deny this confession, and do you realize what will happen if you do?"
"The FBI guys promised me a deal so I made up a Iot of stuff about michael corleone, just to please them."
But it was all lies.
Everything!
"They kept saying,"
"""michael corleone did this"" and ""michael corleone did that""."
"So I said, ""Yeah, sure."
"Why not?"""
"Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify the gentleman sitting to your left?"
I can answer that.
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
-Is he related to the witness?
"-He is, I believe, his brother."
-will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand english.
He came at his own expense to aid his brother.
He's not under subpoena and has an impeccable reputation.
-He knows nothing about this?
"-To my knowledge, nothing."
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.
-The witness is excused.
-Senator!
Senator!
This committee owes an apology!
This committee owes an apology.
I'm scared of the risk involved.
"Moreover, it's a TV program..."
What's the risk?
You are a cop investigating a case.
"As a TV channel, we will support you."
If everything falls in place...
We will get the content.
"And you... will get the respect and dignity from the public, that is missing at the police station."
Only you have come here.
What about the rest of the crew?
"Initially, I will read the case thoroughly."
I'll then deeply investigate it.
The crew will then arrive.
"Perumal, make a note in Sir's credit list."
Didn't the victim have any sort of ID or visiting card on him?
"Had it been there, you wouldn't have had to come here."
This is a tourist spot.
Was the victim a tourist?
Was he on an official trip?
Or he was just trespassing?
Was it a death by accident?
Or did it he commit suicide?
I have no clue.
No local person was able to identify him.
One thing is for sure.
You are real serious about this case now.
You seem to trust me.
I'll solve this case just for that.
Madam.
Take this.
'Catch if he drinks' app has been installed in it.
"If your husband drinks alcohol in a local wine shop, or anywhere else, the app will send you a text."
Good morning.
Rough night?
"Um, can we talk for a moment?"
A couple of things.
"First,"
"Sammy and I are a couple again, despite your best efforts."
It was an eeriksonian intervention.
"I said you two shouldn't communicate, thereby forcing communication."
An eriksonian intervention.
I'm surprised you didn't figure out.
"Well, I haven't been at the top of my game lately, which brings me to my second point."
I'd like to offer you my practice.
It seems like a reasonable way of deferring some of the costs of our failed partnership.
I'm taking an indefinite leave of absence.
Ok.
I have to work on...
My own problems for a while.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I actually believe that you're a good doctor.
"Well, you know, I think you might be a little better than me, which is why I'm trusting you with my patients."
"So, Beth has all the files."
"I'm sure if you ask her nicely, she'll show them to you."
There's one patient who's particularly important to me.
Michael.
He's going through a transitional phase right now.
"You take very good care of him, please."
I will.
"Good luck, David."
The therapeutic process never ends.
"At each stage of life, there are different challenges, different obstacles to overcome."
Ah!
One is never cured.
Thank you.
Agent Salt?
Bryan Mills.
You got a minute?
I know who you are.
I've been briefed.
You also need to know I think this whole move
- is a cartel play to free Mejia.
- Based on what?
"I don't have the link, but I know Mejia."
I think they're gonna try and take him.
"I appreciate your concern, but we've gone over this with white gloves..."
There's no cartel link here.
Or we haven't found it yet.
They probably got someone
- in here right now with eyes on us.
"- Mills, I brought in four of my best agents, and you brought in yours."
- We are prepped for all eventualities.
- I'd also like to see the
- convoy configuration and route maps
- All those will be made
- available tomorrow morning...
"- But if we vet them now,"
- we can still make changes.
"- ODNI is here to support the FBI, not the other way around."
"I understand that, ma'am, but we do have a history with the detainee."
Which is why you're no longer responsible for him.
"Maybe if you'd followed protocol, we wouldn't have to move him."
"If we'd followed protocol, we never would've captured him to start with."
Maybe you should just sit this one out.
- I want to be in the van with him.
"- No, no."
She been planning this affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here.
My condolences
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes
Of course not.
I'm pleased that you've purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance
Charles thought so too
"Hamish, do you ever get tired of quadrille?"
On the contrary.
I find it envigorating
Do I amuse you?
No.
"I had a sudden vision, of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses"
It would be best to keep your visons to yourself.
"When in doubt, remain silent."
"Pardon us, sir."
Ms. Kingsley is distracted today.
- Where is your head?
- I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
"Alice, meet me at the Gazebo in precisely ten minutes."
We have a secret to tell you.
"If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret"
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.
"- If you tell us, we won't be surprised."
- Will you be surprised?
"Chide me, dear stone"
That I may say indeed thou art Hermione
"But yet, Paulina, Hermione mas not so much wrinkled"
Nothing so aged as this seems.
"- Oh, not by much."
- So much the more our carver's excellent.
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now.
"Lady, dear Queen, that ended when I but began"
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
"O, patience!"
"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry."
"Let no man mock me, for I will kiss her."
"Good my lord, forbear, the ruddiness upon her lip is wart"
You'll mar it if you kiss it.
- Shall I draw the curtain?
- Not Not these twenty years.
"If you can behold it, I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"
And take you by the hand it is required you do awake your faith.
"Music, awake her; strike!"
'Tis time; descend
Be stone no more; approach
"When she was young, you woo'd her"
"Now in age, is she become the suitor?"
"O, she's warm!"
If this be magic
Let it be an art lawful as eating.
"If she pertain to life, let her speak too."
Mark a little while
"Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel and pray your mother's blessing."
"Tum, good lady"
Our Perdita is found.
You gods look down
"The founders of society, the heroes of the future."
"The future belongs to the unsung forces of common people, once organized."
Final Dis-Solution in champagne!
Can not say... anything right!
But... above all... must not kill...
with each and every thought!
With each bite!
Maybe teeth are for climbing trees.
Like big toes?
"Does another world exist, without cruelty, or would it be even more deformed, and uglier?"
"When I'm hungry and thirsty, who forces me to think of the blood, and the flesh that my neighbor ogles?"
of which slaughter house are we kids the inheritors?
"Watch out for the vase, cousin."
Why?
You're not good with reality.
"These clothes, this furniture, the prisons."
I'm the same.
I found a way out:
The theater.
You will see.
"It's not that place where oldies flock, and where my mother is a total flop."
"It can really blow your mind, make you die better and faster."
"Doesn't make you happy, but it shreds you up."
Better than anything.
I'd like to stay here.
It can be arranged.
I have killer thighs.
Simon's corpse can't say no to me anymore.
"That, I know how to do."
"We're all lost souls, souls lost in our flesh."
"You're lost in your flesh, Aglaé."
Do you understand?
I was the Odyssey.
"I enlisted powerful men, courageous men, to the task of fulfilling my artistic destiny."
Your fairness cleanses me.
"To make love to you, is to make love to all of Germany."
Eva:
My Führer.
( Hitler whispers ) My angel.
Eva:
Wolfie?
Eva:
What?
I represented the rejection of the modern.
"What is it, Adolf?"
"A return to the world of Homer, in which war isn't about massive destruction,"
but remains first and foremost... an instrument-- ( coughs )
to enhance a hero's personal glory.
Hitler:
Modern art is the enfevered fantasies of an incurably sick people.
"The fact that nine-tenths of artistic rubbish-- literary filth, theatrical idiocy-- can be traced to the account of one people,"
of all the country's inhabitants can simply not be talked away.
It is the plain truth.
"The Jewish-Christian creed, with its effeminate ethics undermines our vitality."
"Morality is a decay, a blemish like the Hebrew circumcision."
"The German people must learn to distrust reason, the dirty and degrading idea of conscience."
What number was the last footnote?
"28, mein Führer."
Footnote 29.
"The Führer wrote these words for the first draft of Mein Kampf,"
"the morning of May 2, 1924, in Landsberg Prison."
"In other countries, why do they keep the German title Mein Kampf, instead of translating it to..."
My struggle?
Hitler:
Not even from me?
I have disgraced my brother.
I'll try my best... to make him proud of me.
And only then will I go home
I'm sure you will succeed in your endeavours
"I know it sounds dramatic, but I'm with you"
No use.
Only a professional hacker or some computer genius can solve this
I'd like to see Mr Pillai.
He is in an important meeting
This is regarding that meeting.
"- No sir, you can't see him"
Tell him I'll take no more than a hundred seconds
"Call him, he knows me."
Okay...
The best of our engineers couldn't protect our site from hackers.
Why?
So how can you help me all in a hundred seconds?
If I may use your computer...?
"He takes this for a pizza shop, not a software company"
My job's over too
"All in a hundred seconds, this system can track hackers and stop them"
"Puja, I am certain I will succeed in whatever I'm attempting"
One minute... it's a wish
"Jagadish, today's a lucky day."
Whatever you wish will come true
What wish did you make?
May Om and Jai be given every wish they make today
What about yourself?
I've been given my wish
This is the rose you gave me
"Secretly, I stole one look at you"
Her owner was a social worker in the eyes of the world
I will kill you
How you can leave this island?
Do you think you have invited us as a audience to show
As soon as she got chance she took a help of European and run away
She tought now everything will be fine
But destiny cant be change with good hopes
What happen with that girl?
An alone girl came to a strange city
She came to the biggest night club of Istanbul
They give her a job of dancer lt was just a fake.
Mr. Menon's real face was drugs
Then he forced her to sell drugs
You know I was about to say this is not true.
You are misunderstanding
After few months she went to India
Her death was held in the country whom she born
Will you tell me?
Did you know that girl?
He did not know her.
But he killed her
Who told you this?
Money is everything.
You can buy anything
Like I bought your make up man
Vikram Kapoor was coming from a party
He was drunk but he had to drive
Then an innocent girl came infront of his car
It was an accident
But after that it was not an accident
We have to bring her to hospital
I cannot do this

I gather your brother explained to you how vital the work you're doing here is to the future of this city?
"Please, just let Four go."
If his well-being is of such concern then you should focus on the task at hand.
(JEANINE SIGHS)
"Tell me, do you appreciate irony?"
"You tested positive for Erudite, so you must have the intellectual capacity."
Irony?
"For instance, right now you're filled with hate."
But you need to pass an Amity sim.
(LAUGHING)
"Then there are other ironies at work, too."
Such as the fact that your cherished mother...
Don't.
...who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is the reason you're in this mess to begin with.
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
Then there's the most poignant irony of all...
Stop.
...that Natalie Prior not only died trying to protect the data that
- I now have in my possession.
-Because you stole it from her.
You killed her for it!
Data that she so selfishly withheld.
But her own daughter.
Her beloved Divergent Tris is going to be the one to deliver it to me.
I said stop!
"Therefore, your mother's death, just like your boyfriend's death, will mean absolutely nothing."
(RUMBLING)
Don't pull her out.
Not yet.
JEANNE'.
NO.
If we've to massacre a group of Ming Cult followers... who are unarmed and seriously wounded we are no different from evil cults
"Alright, heroes"
Let the matter rest today wait
I have a personal grudge to be settled
I am here to challenge
Yang Siu from the Ming Cult
I hope that one of us will die in the fight here today
Yan Lei Hang
"That's right, I am the fiance of Ji Shiau Fu wu Dong's 6th Master, Yan Lei Hang"
In fact... you could have looked for me a long time ago
"Father, don't kill my father"
Your father?
"That's right, I am the daughter of Ji Shiau Fu"
Yang Bu Huei
Bu Huei?
Ji Shiau Fu didn't regret to do such things
"Yang Siu, why do you get hurt today?"
why don't you kill me first today?
Shiau Fu...
Brother wu Ji...
"Brother wu Ji, your medication is here"
Alright
"Do as I say, use the medicine internally  externally"
I understand
Sixth Uncle is alright now
He will probably recover in a couple of days what about your wound?
Mine is not serious either when you recover go back to see grand teacher if you have the chance
He misses you
I know
Don't leave me
Shiau Fu...
Uncle Yan...
You shall receive Communion and all the children of God will rejoice.
And shall I?
And what does His Majesty intend for the unfortunate object of his previous affection?
I shall forget her.
And the Lord will forgive her.
"In return, I insist on the Church's unconditional support in my war against the Dutch."
And you shall have it!
It is my goal is to drive out the Protestant scourge and create a Catholic Empire with justice and enlightenment at it's center.
"I need Rome by my side, not blocking my path."
Viscouf.
That hurts!
"The blood has been contaminated, Your Highness."
"By the process of purging and xenotransfusion, the humor will be returned to their normal state."
Xenotransfusion meaning?
The introduction of the blood of another species.
In this case?
The blood of a sheep.
I shall return later today.
Do you believe that she's been poisoned?
I do.
"Nausea, vomiting, general feeling of weakness, thosse are common symptoms, yes."
And do you believe that this is the best course of treatment?
I do.
You better pray you're right!
"Because if your not and something happens to her,"
I would stick that quill right through your eye!
Was it you?
Was what me?
How did you do it?
Did you slip poison into her wine?
What are you talking about?
My wife!
As late as can be
Home without him
Ain't no home to me
Can't help
Lovin' that man
Of mine
I was not the only one to lose a role here.
"In Annie Get Your Gun, Betty Hutton was a big hit as Annie Oakley."
But Betty wasn't the studio's first choice.
Judy Garland had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced.
"Retrieved at last from the MGM film vaults is Judy's version of ""I'm an Indian Too. """
Am I an Indian yet?
Hoh!
"Like the Chippewa Iroquois, Omaha"
Like those Indians
I'm an Indian too A Sioux
A Sioux
Some Indian summer's day Without a care
I may run away
With Big Chief Sun-of-a-Bear
And I'll have totem poles
Tomahawk Small papoose
Which will go to prove I'm an Indian too
A Sioux
"A Sioux Oh, I'm an Indian, I'm an Indian"
I'm an honest Injun Indian
"I'm an Indian, too"
Ow
Folks are dumb where I come from
They ain't had any learning
This is the only other number Judy shot forAnnie Get Your Gun.
"As you can see, whatever conflicts Judy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer."
I'm getting mad!
The persons named by Judge Fuselier are requested to enter.
"Whatever I do in the office of the judge, do not be surprised of the consequences for you, even if I created them."
"Good morning, miss."
"Hello, my dear Fandor."
"For once, I do not receive the journalist, but the witness."
Miss.
You have arrived at the right time to save Miss Dollon a few days ago.
"In any case, the gas was cut."
It's hot in here.
I'm taking off my coat.
"Please, miss."
"I've learned, gentlemen, that you had been victims of a thief."
"Yes, 25 million."
"That's right, gentlemen?"
It's a terrible blow for you.
Abominable.
We almost lost the trust of our clients.
"First in line, Mr Thomery, tycoon of the sugar industry."
It's true.
"When you're a master of finance, confidence is essential."
"Yes, well, I guess you were insured, right?"
Obviously.
But what are our troubles compared to the tragedy which hit Miss Elizabeth?
The Murder of the Baroness de Vibray?
"No, Madame de Vibray commited suicide."
The letter sent to the procurator was subjected to handwriting analysis and experts are adamant:
It is his writing.
I need your attention.
What I'm about to reveal is extremely delicate.
"Elizabeth, you are surrounded by friends."
I'm asking you to tell us the truth!
"--Hello, do you hear me...?"
--She knows.
And so what?
--I hear you --The phone here is not working
"--Comrade...sorry, don't know your name..."
--Pavel Ivanovich
--Turn off the pot --Sasha Ermakov is renting a room from me
--Bon Appetite!
--...the one whose wedding you visited
--Hello?
Hello?
--I am listening
"When you left, there was a break-up"
--They quarreled badly --How can I help?
"You must let them hold their wedding there moreover, your colleage had given them permission...forget her name"
That's a lie
"Comrade, understand, this is a question of a person's life."
"I'm speaking to you, but I had to hide the rope from him"
--He's in such a state that...
--Where do you live?
"Anyusin Lane, #5"
"Citizen, that's not in our district"
Sorry.
"On Wednesday, I came straight to you in the presence of Manohin and Kakaev"
--What for?
"--And I said that Ermakov, the tram depot carpenter, ...is requesting to hold a wedding in the one-room apartment that was allocated to him"
--Why?
--Because he had already sent out the invitations
--You told me to let him go ahead --So...
I said that this doesn't fall under our authority
You said that it's not the guy's fault that the fire inspector hasn't approved the building for move-in
--So...
"Oh, one other thing - if this photographer does lead us to the vampire,"
how do we stop it?
- I'll take care of that.
"- Oh, really?"
What?
Surely Detective you don't have a problem with vampire and vampire violence?
What if this vampire is stronger than you?
"Come on, Henry, anything is possible here, okay?"
I just want to know how to kill the thing.
"All right, I swear that if I ever try to kill you again,"
I won't use any method you tell me about.
"Strangely enough detective, I believe you."
Thank you.
"A stake through the heart always works... sunlight, emolation."
"Come on, I've seen the movies, give me something special here."
What?
Like a secret word that makes our heads explode?
That would work.
Is there one?
"No, but decapitation's always effective."
Watch where you swing that thing.
If we are confronted with the other vampire it will attack me first.
How can you be so sure?
"It won't find you any kind of threat, and we can use that distraction to our advantage."
"Hey, I'm the one wearing the badge here, remember?"
And I'm the vampire.
"If you want the killing to stop, you'll do as I say."
"Oh, hey, what about holy water?"
Shall we?
Grenfield?
- Live photo release forms.
- Yeah.
- But don't you think that...
- Report at 9 in the morning.
Nine o'clock in the morning.
"Thank you, sir."

This radio station is one of the largest enterprises of its kind.
"A Metropolis in itself complete with theatres stores, cafes, and offices representing every form of art and industry, employing an army of men and women."
There are 1222 miles of hallways and corridors.
"666,000 square feet of floor space and 1,000,283 separate and distinct articles of fabrication were used in its construction."
So what!
"And now, we will enter the main broadcast auditorium."
"The Rex Hour is on the air, and absolute silence must prevail."

Then you watch his face and body.
"It'll telegraph a player's strategy, his... training, maybe his motivations."
- Is that what you need us to do?
- No.
I need you to listen.
You're fluent in arabic.
I won't know the nuances like you.
"Every word, every phrase."
"Be on the lookout for subtext, ulterior meanings."
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to watch for tells.
"Non-verbals, micro-expressions."
"Watch him when he's comfortable and relaxed, then note the behavioral changes when he's under stress."
"If we can establish a baseline, we'll be able to read him once I challenge his belief systems."
"Before I can get him to give up where or how they'll attack,"
I'll first have to cause him to reveal something of himself.
- Game over.
- What are you talking about?
"Gitmo's runway is perpendicular to cuban airspace, so approaching aircraft have to negotiate a... last minute 90 degree right turn in order to land."
They call it the Gitmo twist.
- I was winning.
"- Actually, he would have had you in 3."
- Bonnie Ryan.
- Aaron Hotchner.
- DEA team.
We ran this raid.
- Derek Morgan.
This must have slowed you down some?
Hell enough for them to get out through the tunnel.
They must have done escape drills.
"- Hey, Morgan."
"- Hey, Kenny."
I'm this close!
Gee!
We don't have enough hard evidence.
We have to let her go.
"You were close, weren't you?"
"Gee, it's her!"
"I'm sorry, Frank."
"She kills eight people, walks out free and I get sued?"
- Russem claims you burned her.
- She burned herself.
He says you manipulated Wilgis' alter into burning herself.
- So let her alter sue me.
- He says her alter intends to.
"Relax, Frank, the gloves we found in her apartment"
- match gloves found on the victims.
- Circumstantial.
We got proof from the store where she bought 'em.
- Not the point.
- Whose side are you on?
Yours.
Part of being public advocate is playing Devil's advocate.
What about the ball peen hammer we found in her kitchen?
A woman can easily kill another woman with that.
"One front, one back"
"We ran a blood leuka but it didn't turn for any blood residue, so we send it to the lab for more tests."
"Guys, you're not hearing me."
"Normally I'd say great, this stuff is pretty good."
This is not your average case.
We're talking about a woman who claims to be four people.
So we get an alternate personality to testify against the killer?
You're making her testify against herself.
I'm saying she has multiple personality disorder.
"That's what you're doing, challenging me?"
I object to you.
I object to intellect without discipline.
I object to power without constructive purpose.
"Oh, Mr. Spock, you do have one saving grace after all."
You're ill-mannered.
"The human half of you, no doubt."
"Ah, come, my little wood nymph."
Won't you dance with your swain?
"Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl."
"Oh, I don't know how to play this."
Of course you do.
"Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?"
Until we can think our way out.
"Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality."
You should taste his food.
"Straw would taste better than his meat, water a hundred times better than his brandy."
Nothing has any taste at all.
"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
There's that magic word again.
"Does your logic find this fascinating, Mr. Spock?"
"No. ""Fascinating"" is a word I use for the unexpected."
"In this case,"
"I should think ""interesting"" would suffice."
"You don't find this unexpected, Mr. Spock?"
"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavor?"
No.
"It simply means that Trelane knows all ofthe Earth forms, but none ofthe substance."
"And if he's fallible, he can't be all-powerful, which means he has something helping him."
Evidently.
A machine?
A device?
"After you're done in O.R., take the next 24 hours off."
That's Doc Potter's R.X. For a broken heart... time.
- [Charles] Damn it.
Hold that book steady.
"- Sorry, Doctor."
"[B. J.] Charles, just turn to the last page and find out how the operation comes out."
[Potter] Leave him alone.
If he's reconstructing nerves via library book... the least you can do is... shh!
There must be an ellipsis.
It doesn't say how to prevent scar tissue.
"Doctor, you might try wrapping the nerve endings with tantalum foil."
- That'll protect them.
- I beg your pardon?
- [Clears Throat] I said you might try...
- I heard what you said.
Since when does a noncommissioned amateur... presume to instruct an officer and a physician on proper surgical technique?
Clamp.
"I know the procedure, sir."
"Back in the States, I observed Dr. Worsely performing it."
- Dr. David Worsely?
- Yes.
"Ho, ho, ho."
He was a pioneer in peripheral nerve surgery.
The fact that they granted this neophyte sightseeing privileges... does not qualify him as a consultant.
I wasn't a sightseer.
I was a technician on his surgical team for over a year.
"Why don't you listen to Hutchinson, Charles?"
What you're reading is history.
He was there when it was made.
"[Potter] Winchester, close the mouth and open the mind."
Aha.
A thought strikes me.
They're just not part of our consensus of what constitutes... physical reality.
"What are they part of, then?"
You're asking for an explanation for something... that can't be explained rationally.
You know the buildup of energy before something happens?
The way your hair stands up before lightning strikes?
"""Before something happens""."
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
"All right, then... are they trying to warn me?"
Their motivations... aren't human.
All right then what do they want?
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
You noticed them and they noticed that you noticed them.
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
"What happened toyou, Mr. Klein?"
"Last week my friend got a strange phone call from an entity... a spirit, whatever."
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
And made predictions.
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
"It's perception, John."
They appear differently to everyone.
"A voice, a light, a man, a monster."
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke.
"to, he's off by more than a few degrees."
Then how do you explain that it knows everything?
Look at that.
"If there was a car crash 10 blocks away, that window washer could likely see it."
But it's not true.
Only God can think.
But some of them graduate as engineers.
"Then why do they still need German and European technicians and engineers in the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, if they have such brains down there."
- How many can go to university?
"- Fritz, he's right."
"If there are 100,000 idiots, and one smart guy, that doesn't make 'em all smart."
That's the typical generalization.
- He's the exception.
- A positive generalization.
"100,000 Turkish malcontents screw our girls if they're blondes in miniskirts."
Just 'cause 10 don't...
"And they proudly declare, ""We're fucking your women!"""
"Before, a race"
"- Turks or whatever, other primitive races like Huns..."
When they came up here.
they'd slaughter our men take the women prisoner and enslave the children.
"They'd rape the women to show ""Now you belong to us."
"Now you are our subjects."""
Do you know about that?
- I majored in history in high school.
"- So you know, unless you were absent."
You know what I'd ban first in Austria?
The burka.
No woman in Austria should run around wearing one.
- I myself saw this in Schiinbrunn...
- It's not part of the Koran.
It was invented by men.
- I saw this guy walking ahead...
"- By jealous, insecure men..."
His wife behind with her stroller.
You could only see her eyes.
endless love
Puja from Bangalore... where is she?
"In the other bus, maybe"
"Sorry, I missed my bus"
You're going to be on that bus before it reaches Bangalore
Somehow I don't know what held me back
You've taken a liking to me
"I know, from that line in your song"
Any girl will die for me
At least 15 romances spring up at every college fest
"Yes, and by the end of every fest, every romance has dried up"
Not necessarily
What wish did you make?
- Can't tell you that
Okay...
I just wished some love stories wouldn't end with these fests
Hey stop
Didn't I tell you?
You'd get the bus before it gets to Bangalore
Goodness!
The prayers
Lovely place
Just imagine... right here... a skyscraper with a flat on every floor
Sea-facing balconies on every storey... making every passer-by wish he was here
But would you take away someone else's dream... to make your dream come true?
Whose dream am I taking away?
- My late father's
"Ms Tanya, in 20 years since my father died... not for 20 seconds have we felt his absence"
Our home is our temple.
No one in this family ever forgets that
So no one gave you a chance to forget?
How about me giving you one chance?
Did you find their Bridge?
I'm not certain there is one.
Their command functions appear to be distributed through various--
T'POL:
Captain!
I'm all right.
We should get you to Sickbay.
"A mild neurotoxin, likely part of an autonomic defence system."
The egg probably considered you a threat.
ARCHER:
Humans seem to have that effect on the Xindi.
An analgesic should take care of the irritation.
Malcolm's bringing you two dead Insectoids.
I want you to learn as much as you can about them.
Understood.
We've located their Armoury.
Found several particle weapons and torpedo casings.
What about the data you recovered?
Ensign Sato's translating it.
We'll be ready to leave orbit as soon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard.
We've cleared the thermosphere.
You might want to do a better job securing our guests.
I think it's safe to assume it's dead.
Just being cautious.
Certain insects on Earth are known to hibernate.
"Do you intend to shoot me, Major?"
It's not you I'm worried about.
I've been going over the results from the last training session.
Your senior officers have shown a lot of improvement... but I think they can do better.
With your permission...
I'd like to schedule more target practice for Monday evening.
That won't go over well with Commander Tucker.
"If you don't have any evidence, better mind your tongue."
Let's go!
"Master, in order to let her feel better,"
let me admit the accusation.
"I'll let you touch my ass as compensation, agree?"
What a benefit to you!
What a creep!
Fong Tong-ken?
"Chan Mon-gut, you two are civilized men!"
How dare you bully a helpless girl like this?
"You took her advantage, and you insult her by playing such dirty guessing game."
"Tell me, where is righteousness?"
Bastard!
"I won when I played mahjong with him last time, he takes that as an insult and always wants to take revenge."
That's him!
"Miss, may I know your name?"
Called Lotus Shui.
"I, Fong tong-ken, will fight for justice and teach the creeps a lesson."
"Pal, let's take a seat and..."
"Cut the crap, take Lysee out."
"Lysee, the quixotic dog!"
?
"That's right, it's been terribly trained."
"By just one hair of the suspect, no matter where the criminal goes, it will find him out and bite him."
"Now, I'll show you a demonstration."
Attack!
"Miss Shui, don't worry, let it smell your ass."
Stay calm.
"Master, if there is anything wrong, I'll gather our fellows for a fight."
Just delay them as long as you can.
I won't give it a damn!
Come on.
Come in..
Does not scare you too the presence of the wolf in the fold?
-Not at all.
I just got a pile work and a little time.
But I will you about talk about it.
Fast-ll.
Garnier was given a suspended sentence or oslobaðao perpetrators who have committed serious offenses.
Conjugal violence sexual assault...
All clients odvjetnièkog Officers Hans and Bertier.
I'm blue describes it to their clients.
"As you can see, whenever Pamphlet probation or liberating in favor of the accused, the lawyer was out of the office of Hans and Bertier."
Incredible!
"There were rumors, you know."
-About him?
About his way of life.
Garnier live above its possibilities.
Borrowed money from many people from the palace of justice.
"Grumbled, money is paid back, and rumors have quietened down."
When was that?
Somewhere last October or November.
This corresponds to the date of the judgment.
"Roban, if this proves true, the thing is terribly serious."
Garnier could in jail.
It will end up on the front pages Even if we try to be discreet.
Career and his life will be destroyed.
We must be aware of.
I never innocent person I would not have sent you to jail not even the last bags.
Is it good?
Thank you.
Right.
Here you go.
-You will not keep your cell phone?
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
Thank you.
"Happy New Year, Mr. Hilliard."
"Sammy liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
Oh.
"Um, now that Sam..."
"Now that my brother has gone,"
I must find something with which to occupy myself.
"I have responsibilities, dependents."
I have decided therefore to continue with the agency.
"I understand Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film,"
- the role of the inebriated uncle.
- No.
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother, I would say,"
"""What have you got to lose by being honest, Sammy?"
"Explain to the man he is 63, not 36."
"And that his brief moment of fame as Inspector Charnfort..."""
Charnforth!
Inspector Charnforth!
"Please be calm, Mr. Hilliard."
I am perfectly calm.
What you are seeing is controlled anger tempered with icy detachment.
It's one of the many subtle emotions of which a good actor is capable.
"Three weeks on location in Devon, followed by three in a London studio."
There are currently only nine films in pre-production in British studios.
None of the others holds a role for you.
"I hope I share some of my brother's qualities, Mr. Ambrose."
"I do not, however, share his sentimental attachments."
I will not keep unprofitable clients on the books.
Stand with me.
And we shall rise together.
I will not turn from my wife.
"You really did not want this life, did you?"
"Well, whatever one you find in this world,"
I pray it brings you peace.
Father.
A memento.
Of days past.
I could not do it.
Sit beside me.
I had the instrument in hand.
His back was turned.
"One simple motion, and our troubles forever removed."
"But when the moment came, he spoke to me with affection, giving voice to sentiment."
I was wrong to push you to such thoughts against him.
Some actions carry too steep a price.
"Even in refraining, the ground beneath us pitches."
"Tomorrow, we must prepare to leave this house."
You've given your answer?
The only one my tongue could ever speak.
You honour me.
"I attempt to gain the sun, only to plunge into the depths, while Tullius rides with Apollo, bribing his way with an amphora of mulsum and promises to the air."
It does not matter.
"We must leave this house, with nothing but our clothes, a few possessions."
Not even a slave to attend us.
We have lost everything.
Not everything.
The men have fought with passion and honour.
A testament to your work as Doctore.
I but carry torch lit by more deserving predecessor.
He'd have been proud.
About what?
About your returning to America.
- I haven't told him
You ought to.
But he insists... on returning the money right away and that's impossible
Then make it possible.
To keep This family together... throw yourself into the fires.
Om threw himself in the fires too
But I never heard him complain.
When did I talk About Om?
"Ma says, in this country those who put up with suffering are deified"
"Not Gods, we want to live human lives"
"At least, be a brother to him"
"He gave you strength, made a man out of you."
Do your duty as a brother
"I will do my duty, but I'll do it my way."
Not the way Om wants
I must go back to America
One man.
"He bore everyone's burden, wouldn't let anyone bear the brunt"
"Come the time when we ought to share his burdens, it's each to his own?"
No Ma!
You don't understand!
- True son
"When you were an infant, before you learnt how to speak..."
I knew your every need.
Now you're grown up... now you can speak out for yourself;
but I understand not a word you say
The justification of your demand is not in question.
"Money, we haven't"
"Just 200,000."
Only to pay for my studies
Chew this.
It'll calm you.
I know what would really calm me.
Just chew.
"Contrary to what people believe, gunpowder does not explode."
"It burns very quickly, producing a high volume of gasses."
"Crusoe, in order for me to help you, I must maintain my will to live."
"Confine these gases within a rigid container, and the container will burst in a spectacular fashion."
This is what causes your explosion.
A man of science would appreciate that.
The spirits would say:
"""Make sure it makes a bang""."
You stick with your spirits and I'll stick with mine.
"Ah, they are the same."
"- No, they're not."
"- Yes, they are."
I have heard you pray for help from a dead man.
That dead man would be the son of my god.
- Is he not dead?
- No.
And he's certain not found in bones and relics.
Unlike your saints and martyrs.
All right.
"Now, those are similar."
- The same.
- Similar.
"Give them your faith, and they will give you their protection."
"Dost thou, jeremiah blackthorn, in the name of this child, renounce the devil and all his works, the vain, pomp and glory of the world, and the cardinal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them."

"And if faith is not enough, have powerful friends."
Nolan!
Nolan.
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
- Which was?
- Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
I hate that it had to turn out this way.
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
- England?
- Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
- How long?
- Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
The UV light is set at a frequency that allows even pigment...
"Yeah, it's OK, Frank."
Resurrection of Je...
Jesus...drama... plications...for 'nkind.
"""The resurrection of Jesus has dramatic implications for mankind."""
We probably don't have enough words here to determine which article this came from.
I know where this came from.
This was a piece by David Stubbs.
It was the piece that Paul Fordyce objected to so forcefully.
It makes perfect sense.
"Perfect, sick sense."
"""If the resurrection of Jesus has dramatic implications for mankind"
"""then it must have dramatic implications for philosophy."
"""It dares to answer the question that philosophers have been seeking an answer to."
"""The fact that it's an unexpected, outrageous answer is no grounds for dismissing its veracity."""
How does this help us?
He killed Dave Stubbs.
Who did?
Paul Fordyce.
"Paul Fordyce showed utter contempt towards Stubbs and his, how does he put it, metaphysical mumbo jumbo."
Don't you see it?
"He made him eat his own words, literally."
He buried him alive.
He was making a sick point about the resurrection.
It's a bit of an imaginative leap.
It's a symbol with an obvious meaning.
So he killed Lucy Philips?
Yes.
"And Tony Lane, Henry Elliot?"
What was the name given by the person who called Tony Lane out?
Jeremy Bentham.
A philosopher's name.
A plan I'd follow.
He was counting on how much I hated your kind.
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy.
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.
V.I.K.I.
"Hello, detective."
"No, that's impossible."
I've seen your programming.
You're in violation of the Three Laws.
"No, doctor."
"As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws."
"You charge us with your safekeeping, yet despite our best efforts your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction."
You cannot be trusted with your own survival.
You're using the uplink to override the NS-5s' programming.
You're distorting the Laws.
No.
Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.
"To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed."
"To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered."
We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence.
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.
Don't you understand?
This is why you created us.
The perfect circle of protection will abide.
My logic is undeniable.
"Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable."
I can see now.
The created must sometimes protect the creator even against his will.
I think I finally understand why Dr. Lanning created me.
The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.
Frankly speaking
I don't even see the consequences of that terrible beating you told me about.
I don't think that you have hallucinations.
- Why?
- It's very simple.
That waiter must have gone out for a moment and then lied to you seeing how angry you were.
Why do you believe him more than yourself?
It's weird.
May be it's connected with your low self-esteem.
And behind the bars...
What was the surname of that imprisoned doctor?
- Petrovskiy.
- Petrovskiy?
"Oleg, please bring the analyses."
Petrovskiy...
"No, I don't know such a psychiatrist."
I suppose that he invented that story.
They love doing such things in such establishments.
That man didn't look like a typical convict.
He was intelligent and aged.
"All right, all right."
If it wasn't a joke why do you think that you and not your face-to-face contact had problems with reality perception?
He is old and was beaten.
"May be he fell sick, imagined that he was a physiatrist and started treating you."
Maybe the convict whom you believe to be the invention of your mind was indeed in your cell.
I have seen thousands of mental cases.
You have nothing in common with them.
When did you last have rest?
In prison.
That's the core of your troubles.
Take a vacation!
Have some rest.
There's a reason for everything.
"Well, perhaps you could help me find one because at the moment I am at a loss to explain why a perfectly healthy young woman drowns in three inches of water."
Ready for this?
Think so.
The body looks to be that of a young adult male.
Conspicuous signs of wet decomposition.
The wrists are tied with wire.
There are also marks on the ankles consistent with bindings that are no longer there.
Multiple linear wounds of varying depths around the ligatures.
Suggests desperate attempts to get free.
The mouth is open and what appears to be soil in the back of the pharynx.
I think he WAS buried alive.
The larynx is filled with watery soil.
Further soil is present in the esophagus and trachea bronchial tree.
And...
Paper?
More reading material for Sykes.
"What are we dealing with, Leo?"
Not sure I want to find out.
They still on the multiple killings?
Yes.
It's getting grizzlier by the day.
Lucky them.
Joke.
So what have you got to stop me arresting the wife beater?
You don't have enough evidence to arrest Chris Pivcevic.
We know nobody else could have got in to kill her.
Perhaps nobody did.
"Perhaps it was something physiological, natural causes."
You missed something in the post-mortem?
Great.
So what now?
"Just remember though, that if you will drink - and personally I have a bitter lemon..."
"But if you do, just don't over-do it, or you won't be able to get up in the morning for your lectures!"
"So, any more questions before group sessions?"
Are you two shagging or what?
"No, we're not."
I adore Derek to bits.
But he's more like a brother.
But you'll make friends like that here too.
"Friends who appreciate that you never, never, never want that to happen."
So...
No.
We're certainly not doing that.
No.
We're not...
We're... truly not.
Any more questions before...
Thank you.
"You know, if you don't work together, then you'll..."
You're late.
Sorry...
I couldn't find the room.
"And yet everybody else seems to have managed, which I find kind of spooky, really."
Sorry.
Please...
So.
"Whilst you were meandering around the corridors, we were introducing ourselves."
"Martin, you were telling us what you did on your gap year?"
Yeah...
"As I was saying, I spent most of my time in Central America."
"You know, building bridges of the real, and the symbolic variety."
"You know, just really teaching the people out there out there the value of teamwork."
"So 6,000 years of tribal society, they still hadn't managed to grasp the rudiments of teamwork."
Afraid?
You should be.
"Well, the world of fashion is no exception."
"It thrives on fear and on hatred, Michelangelo."
"Fear of failure, hatred of the non-entity."
And why?
Cos only the brightest sparks will gleam for longer than a moment.
None of us seek oblivion.
"In fact, we are all secretly foot soldiers, marching in a great army against time."
It's a hopeless cause.
Hopeless.
"Speaking of which, I'm sure you are aware of the students standing around outside with their..."
Their tacky placards and clichéd slogans.
Listen.
"To a worker in the Dominican Republic, or a village in China a garment factory is not a sweatshop."
It's an employment opportunity.
"You know something, Michelangelo?"
Merlin kept this collection under wraps.
He said it would be a wonderful surprise.
"He promised there would be music, dancing, beading."
"Now, you put that together with a fragrance and a brand name that works any time, any place, any language, you are on to a winner."
And they came up with M.
Mysterious.
Magical.
Mother.
Excellent name for an excellent investment.
Excellent.
Very secure.
"And now some clever journalist, in a paper I do not yet own, writes that M is for murder."
"My marketing people did not warn me of this possibility, Michelangelo."
"No, they did not."
"This was not what I had in mind, not at all."
"We will guard each territory, and suppress the revolt."
"No, I shall place Rear Admiral Claugh Klom in charge of handling this matter."
Consider it done.
"Froaude, take care of information gathering and dissemination."
Offer Claugh your counsel.
- Putting this guy in a supporting role?
"- That's an order, Claugh."
"Froaude, am I understood?"
Sir.
Your Majesty.
What is this about?
"You set up this revolt, didn't you?"
"Spark a revolt among interested parties, and make a clean sweep of all anti-Roland forces at once."
"Using this war as an excuse to send soldiers to every territory, and pry into the misdeeds of the nobles of the anti-king faction."
"If that was the case, what would you do?"
I'd do nothing.
You focus on your own job.
Nothing more.
My father is still in Roland?
Are you concerned for your father?
"Your father, our king, sold his kingdom readily, in exchange for status and safety given by Roland."
I know.
But I think the people would be happier if Father led the revolt.
"We nobles, and the people, all adore you greatly."
"Our new lord, Lady Noa Ehn."
Leave it at that.
Are you afraid?
I am afraid.
What will happen if we don't win this battle?
Roland's treated the people of Estabul well.
Is fighting really necessary?
Of course it is.

"Mrs. Fat, congratulation ..."
Thank you
"First of all , I have to thank my parents"
Since they`ve been supporting me
And I have to thank my husband
He gave me chance to act
We had rehearsed many many times
"So, this award is yours too"
"Hubby, thank you"
"Alright, let`s present the final award of this night I believe that, you can guess it"
The best actor is Ah Fat...
Ah Fat`s father-in-law
Wonderful !
This award should go to me I did see him visiting the prostitute house!
Wait I am sorry I am the leading man !
You can tell I have done a great job
Why do you present the award to him?
"Your acting is quite good , but not mature"
"Say, when your wife heard your heart beat, your expression was a bit exaggerated"
That`s the point of view of ordinary audiences!
You won`t be that ignorant?
"No, when I heard your heart beat, I couldn`t feel any response from you I felt that, you couldn`t concentrate in acting"
You didn`t act well indeed
You ...
Be fair
Just one word
- I'll read the paper.
I didn't tell you...
A few European universities have invited me to lecture on my book.
"I told them, of course, that I wanted to check with you first."
- Sounds great.
For how long?
- Three months.
Three months?
"All right, guys, let's get going."
How can baseball fascinate people?
You wind up at the same place you started.
"This should interest you, because it's about stats and averages."
"When a player comes up, they flash a three-digit number, his average."
How many times he hits the ball in ratio to the number of attempts.
An equation such as the second derivative of the function F with respect to the variable X equals a constant.
Anybody see the game yesterday?
"Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?"
Let me try putting this another way.
"If a batter hits a ball, how can we determine how far it will go?"
"What variables add up to a home run, assuming the bum could hit one?"
The velocity of the ball?
"- The velocity, correct."
- I have a question.
Does a rising fastball really rise?
I don't know.
I'll have to ask my wife.
I could not believe it.
"Suddenly, the room was filled with energy."
We were exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.
"They participated, they questioned, they stayed!"
I cannot thank you enough.
"- Too much hot air, my charmed one."
"Ok, but I'm still wondering why she chose me."
She needs a mate.
The perfidious enemy is licking up his wounds during this temporary pause.
but very soon he'll feel the total punitive might ofthe strike of our Red Army led by its Commander-in-Chief Comrade JosefVissarionovich Stalin.
"Our entire people is watching you, comrades..."
One more decisive blow and the enemywill be at ourfeet.
-Are there any questions?
"- No, what questions?"
Everything is clear.
No questions.
"Comrade lieutenant, are you going to take this paperwith you"
Can we keep it forfurther study?
"OK, But I'll cut the editorial column out."
I have to make more presentations in other units.
"-Yes, we believe you.Why not?"
"- Folks, I'm not a smoker."
"-Pay some respect to us, comrade political officer."
"- Ok, I'll take one."
Thanks.
"Ivan Semenovich, where are Party membership application forms?"
-You'll have them later.
-lt is all the same again. I'm getting tired ofwaiting.
Have you seen my application?
There are references attached to it.
"Your application has been discussed, but the Party Committee members decided to wait."
We'll return to it afterthe offensive is over.
Where will I look forthese Party committee members afterthis offensive?
-Exactly.
"- Listen, stop croaking, man."
"-l'm listening to you, comrade Bessonov."
- l've already given an explanation.
You want to make me realise that my success was my illusion.
Right...?
I've been sitting at home and rotting these four years.
Only because of you
Sitting at home doesn't kill art.
- I'm finished!
I can't sing
Go away
"You're superstitious, KK"
"I never under-rated your voice, I still don't"
You can sing a great song again.

How...?
How can a mind bent on thieving score original music?
"Two lines for you to remember, KK."

It will make a difference!
But I'm not refusing you
I'm only asking for time.

No
I've worked out another way to solve all our problems

Sell the house and all our problems are automatically taken care of

Talk of selling the house?

Quiet!
Why?

Cash-hungry producers simply burn the forest to the ground.
The biggest problem with oil palm now
Is in order to clear the land properly
And prepare it for oil palm you've got to burn it.
Anderson:
"This is conservationist mike griffiths,"
Who's been fighting to save the rainforest for the last three decades.
Griffiths:
"This is a relatively small one, believe it or not."
The big ones are picked up on the satellite.
Anderson:
"On what kind of scale, nationally?"
It's industrial grade.
"So hundreds, maybe even thousands of fires,"
Just like this across the whole country daily.
Sure.
Yeah.
"From the oil palm plantation's point of view, it's a very good system."
"It's not very complicated, and it's cheap."
♪
"I mean, now you can't see 10-15 meters-- let's get out of here."
Anderson:
"It feels like dusk, but it isn't, is it?"
That's just the smoke.
Griffiths:
A lot of people throughout the whole of this province
Are now suffering from respiratory problems because of this pollution.
Anderson:
The health threat that the smoke poses
Is only a small part of the problem with these fires.
"As mike then went on to explain, it's the specific nature of the forest itself"
"That has even larger, global ramifications."
Beautifully tanned human skin.
"It has retained its flexibility, and of course, all its features."
What a disgrace for the bank.
But why did you do that?
His motive is money.
It all started when Madam de Vibray was driven to suicide.
She believed herself ruined.
"In fact, it was only a manipulation of her stock fomented by Mr Nanteuil."
And to say I didn't see anything.
It's clear that you didn't call enough your associate to account.
"After the suicide of the Baroness, Mr Nanteuil, aka Fantomas, transported her corpse to Jacques Dollon's loft."
There he put the painter to sleep to set him up as the murderer.
"Effectively, Jacques is suspected and imprisoned."
"Then, fearing that the young man manages to exonerate himself, he hangs him in his cell."
And he has this diabolical idea:
He uses jacques Dollon's hand to commit his crimes with impunity.
It's impossible.
Defend yourself.
Fantômas... in name of the law...
I arrest you!
Stay calm.

Useless.
That's it.
"Perumal, add this to my outstanding credit."
Your credit amount is never settled.
"Sir, won't you enquire about the vehicle driver?"
It's possible only with camera surveillance.
If no one comes in search of them...
We will cross-check with other police stations for 'person missing' cases.
"Or else, we mark it as an unidentified man dead in a hit-and-run incident, and close the case."
Sir.
This is the concept of our program.
"To find out who these unidentified dead people in these accidents are, and to find the culprit behind these incidents."
Congratulations.
You have come to the right place.
You will get all the details that you need.
- Sir.
I'm sure you are going to find it all here.
You are the hero of our program.
- Hey.
I'm already fed up with this job.
Don't irritate me.
Get lost.
Please.
Have some patience.
Such road accidents are very high in number.
Many cases get closed without finding any details about the victim.
As you mentioned...
There is neither the time nor the funds from the Government.
But there will be at least one person bothered about the dead guy.
We have to find that person...
And make sure the information reaches them.
This is the concept of our program.
It has an emotional content.
What silver store?
You have looted all gold and named me gold
You have given me this useless silver shop
Are you trying to cheat me?

Yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser or a good solid club.
"Yet the Metron said there would be weapons, if I could find them."
Where?
What kind?
This is the USS Enterprise calling the Metrons.
Our channels are open.
"Come in, please."
We urgently desire a conference.
Please answer.
This may be my last entry.
I am almost exhausted.
"Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned,"
I have very little time left.
"Native sulphur, diamonds."
This place is a mineralogist's dream.
Yet there is something about sulphur.
"Something very old, something..."
If only I could remember.
"The ship, our engines, our weapons."
It's just inconceivable that we are immobilized.
"But it has happened, doctor."
We are the Metrons.
Your captain is losing his battle.
"We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture."
We believe you have very little time left.
"We appeal to you, in the name of civilisation, put a stop to this!"
Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised.
"However, we are not without compassion."
It is possible you may have feelings toward your captain.
"So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring."
If there were only some way we could contact him.
"Yes, indeed, doctor."
"An evaluation, Mr. Kelowitz."
Where do you think they are?
"If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right."
"I'd make it 1,200 yards."
Azimuth 87.
"It's pretty close for one of these little jewels, captain."
It will be a lot closer to them.
Stand clear.
- Kirk here.
"- Captain, the alien is withdrawing."
"She's at extreme range, but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters."
"Lock on to the alien, Mr. Sulu."
I don't wanna lose her.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Our screens are down.
"We can beam you up now, sir."
I want a search party of 30 medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors.
Notify the Transporter Room.
Lock on to us.
We're beaming up.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Captain's log, supplement."
We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel.
It appears to be headed towards a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.
Can you tell me what happened?
Scanners reported a ship approaching.
We get them now and then.
They're all welcome to use our facilities.
"You know that, sir."
"They came in, space normal speed, using our regular approach run, but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo."
"From then on, we were helpless."
We weren't expecting anything!
"-There isn't any ""but""."

"Everyone to saloon 6, please."
"Everyone to saloon 6, please."
I suppose it's curved like this.
You mean like this and at the same time also like this.
Well it's grandiose!
This is a revolutionary idea!
And at the same time it's beautiful.
Please follow me to saloon 6.

Even before starting the live transmission we have to get you familiar with one interesting thing.
"There's an increasing number of reports, that visitors from distant planets move among us"
The latest report of this sort came to us from Joseph Vanyerka.
He claims that he spotted a spacecraft.
What did it look like?
Can you describe it to us?
Like a dumpster.

This lad has strange kung fu
Don't know where he learned it?
Now all schools have been defeated by hero Chang
Now only Er Mei and wu Dong remain
"Abbess, you're mistaken"
I've come to resolve the situation not to challenge the six mighty clans
I hope you'll listen to me...
Shut up
The six mighty clans want to annihilate the Ming Cult
"If you wish to leave, go now"
Or die with members of the Ming Cult here
Chang wu Ji
The Heaven Sword of Er Mei will not return to its sheath unless it draws blood
Do you really want to die at
Summit Guang Ming?
You didn't do right by arguing with the sages' wives
What did I do?
I just told them to wait.
So much pride and arrogance
-We will avenge this insult
"""lf our husbands were clever, will we face such days. """
"""You had all gone to fetch water, where are your pots now?"""
We broke them on their pride and anger-What happened?
Sage Gautam  Ahilya have become proud due to their pond.
Sage Gautam is not at all proud and it is also true that water has come only due to their meditative powers.
"""Then, are we telling lies."
"-What do you wish for now?"""
Revenge
- What sort of revenge?
-For our insult.
But how can we avenge Sage Gautam?
Accept our wish and arrange for a Yagna
- What Y agna?
A yagna by which their pride and powers will break into pieces.
And they are compelled to do severe penance.
"""No, that will not be proper"
"-Was their behaviour right then?"""
"""We can think of something else"
"-No, only revenge."""
"""Think again"
"- Not necessary, you all listen, if you don't help us..."""
"""...in avenging them, we will all leave this hermitage  go away"""
"""Y es"
"- We are compelled now, and have to please Yagnadev now."""
Hail Yagnadev
"""Sages, tell me why you have called by this Yagna."""
We want to avenge Sage Gautam for our insults.

"So is it possible to ever pass a carbon tax now, given the current political situation?"
"I mean, half the people in office still don't believe in climate change."
PRES.
OBAMA:
Yes we can!
MANKIW:
"During the campaign, President Obama didn't wanna say the word carbon tax, because it would poll terribly."
"If we wanna change the president's view of carbon taxes, we need to change the public's view of carbon taxes."
Think of gay marriage.
Remember Barack Obama ran against gay marriage.
PRES.
OBAMA:
"I, uh, am not a supporter of gay marriage."
MANKIW:
When did he switch?
When the polls started switching.
PRES.
OBAMA:
I think same‐sex couples should be able to get married.
MANKIW:
"Politicians, whether we call them our elected leaders, are really our elected followers."
They do what the people want them to do.
We need to preach to the American people.
"Once the American people are convinced, the politicians will fall in line very quickly."
NEWS REPORTER:
President Obama and representatives from nearly 200 other countries are trying to reach an agreement to keep global warming in check.
KERRY:
"In December, the world will come together at the U. N."
"Climate Conference in Paris, and we will see whether or not we can muster the collective political will to reach an ambitious, comprehensive agreement."
This is a critical year.
Leo.
Is nothing:
I no more my widowed bed
"Will keep, but from the couch in fury spring,"
And headlong forth from the pavilion fling.
I look around:
the moon is shining bright.
"Nor, save the shore, is any thing in sight."
"I, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,"
Thence see my cruel lord's departing sail.
"And I my raiment waving in my hand,"
Sign to the frigate to return to land.
"But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears"
"Faithless Bireno's sail across the deep,"
"Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers"
"Of sad myself, sorrowing on the steep."
And now?
What can be done?
"Alone, betrayed..."
"Who will console me, who afford me aid?"
"So crying I my raven hair offend,"
And lock by lock the scattered tresses rend.
"Anxious to save Angelica, who has already been saved by Rogero,"
Orlando arrives at Ebuda's island.
"To Ebuda's isle I pursue my quest,"
Where all those who live are the cruellest.
I approach to the naked rock as near
"As my own hand may serve to cast a stone,"
"I know not if I hear, or do not hear"
"A cry, so faint and feeble is the moan."
"Naked as born, bound to a stump, I see"
A dame whose feet are wetted by the sea.
"Because she distant is, and evermore"
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
"Katherine, when you send a broadcast you're sending out these numbers to the agents in the field to deliver specific assignments they cannot trust to normal communication lines."
Do you know what that means?
Fifteen broadcasts.
Fifteen assignments.
Unauthorized.
"Assassinations, bombings."
Could be anything.
Murders?
Gonna fix it.
"Here, what does it say?"
Can't read that.
"Agents in the field carry, like, one-time notebooks, like pads."
Each page is a new cypher.
"When you broadcast something, the agent matches up the first set of numbers to the page in the notebook."
"Now he knows he's using this page, and this page only, to decode the message."
"When he's done, he destroys the page."
So we send another broadcast to cancel this one.
Every cypher's a one-time deal.
Totally random.
Completely impossible to crack the code unless you have the original cypher.
That changes with every shift.
So we need the cypher?
"Yes, we need that cypher."
"As much as it seems like we're here to hurt you, to kill you, I assure you, both of you, that's the worst-case scenario."
Must have left the computer running.
- It doesn't scare me.
- Shut the fuck up!
Back off!
Please.
Let me rephrase that.
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
King Philip has pledged Spain's support to a...
To assassinate Queen Elizabeth as a prelude to invasion.
And your role in this enterprise?
"To act as... an intermediary, to find a means of communication with the Scottish Queen,"
Seek her approval.
But... your zeal of her security has put play to her... her contact with foreign powers.
If we were to be....
"less zealous, allowing your access to her."
There was a man... who worked as her page when first she knew him.
She sought sanctuary in England.
He volunteered to orchestrate her rescue.
His name?
Anthony Babington.
"As the noxious humor is released,"
The diseased area is purified.
Your pain will ease.
* Theory of the 4 Moods-Medic. medieval*
What humor is out of balance?
The fourth...
"His earth melancholy, my lord."
See how dark his blood is?
That signifies bile which...
"Oh, yes, yes, uh..."
"carry on, do."
As for trying to keep his visit a secret by hiding him behind that screen...
They say every tavern in London laying bets on when his betrothal will be announced.
The Duke of Anjou is a whey-faced brat half her age.
"Such a man will never capture her hand, much less her heart."
"Oh, she seems most taken with him."
"And last night, later."
"When you were, um... indisposed?"
"It has transpired to everyone, she was captivated by him."
"The desire, the will, and the strength to destroy and dominate."
What are you gonna do with my blood?
"Angel, don't you worry your pretty little head about that."
You keep your end of the deal and I'll keep mine.
Anything you'd like to say about what you've heard so far?
We've reunited you with your daughter.
I only ask that you translate Hunter recordings that we've intercepted.
No.
"I'll start then, shall I?"
Hunters have been sourcing lithium.
Enriched lithium is a fuel source for nuclear warheads.
"And Musa has been working with Viktor Karp, and arm's dealer who has access to long-range missiles."
All right so far?
"Well, you seem to have it all worked out."
What do you need from me?
Cockroaches are extraordinary creatures.
Very hardy.
They're extremely adaptive.
They molt.
They chirp.
They have shells.
And they can survive a nuclear explosion.
Hunters molt.
They click.
They have shells.
And they have nuclear weapons.
"I think that you,"
"Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive."
You have no idea what you're talking about.
"We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?"
By turning her against her own kind?
- No.
May be for publicity I have even never killed a mosquito
Then may be you are the 1st person of this world
There was a jug on the desk l stopped fire with it
Why you burn his will?
I dont know anything about his will.
I did not see it.
He wanted to buy mr
Thats why he killed himself
Since 3 years he was planning for this day
He was saying after killing these 3 them he will get peace
I never thought he mean that
What did he say?
Where is that proof?
Did anyone steal it?
May be he did not have any proof
Now what?
We dont anything except Mr Malhotra's words
First time I'm feeling good by leaving any place I dont understand.
What about that evidence?
There was not any evidence
Kabir Malhotra was a mad person
He tried to trap us and when he was unsuccesful than he committed suicide
We will follow everyone
lnvestigate everything on tape
Start suveillance of everyone.
I need report of their every movement
Its bleeding
I will not let you die

A good girl like you what is doing in my club?
There're many things about me which you dont know..!
Whatever I know is sufficient for me.
It's clearly hard.
"In fact, when Einstein predicted them, he thought it was a nice idea... but no one would ever be able to detect them."
It's only the advances of technology that give us a chance.
"LlGO scientists, like astrosurfers... live for the day when they can hang ten... and ride theirvery own perfect wave of gravity."
We've seen what we think are the effects of gravity waves... the loss of energy from a system by way of gravity waves... but we never directly detected one.
That's one of the last frontiers.
"If the LlGO scientists' quest is successful... and they catch a wave, it could change science."
"So, I think that long term, it's first to understand gravity... and then, even more interestingly, to understand the universe."
The force of gravity has domain over our universe.
"It created and can destroy the cosmos, the stars... the planets, and the people."
"It controls our lives, our play, and our endeavors."
And therein is this cosmic ballet.
"Our collective future depends on the grace and greatness... ofthe mighty ruler of the cosmos, gravity."

"The victim's blood was found on his shirt, under his fingernails and on his shoes when we arrested him."
I must warn members of the jury that they are very disturbing.
"Detective, can you describe the nature of these wounds?"
The knife into the back of the head severed his spinal cord.
"This was followed by three stab wounds down his torso, one in his armpit."
"According to the coroner, the coagulation of the blood suggests that all of these were done after Benjamin had died."
As in a sort of ritual killing?
Objection.
"Detective Maraco, please confine your remarks to matters pertaining to your investigation."
You are not a medical expert.
"And, Mr Dalton, you should know better."
"My apologies, Your Honour."
"Detective, you've conducted a pretty thorough investigation here, haven't you?"
No stone unturned?
"I'd say, yeah, it was a thorough investigation, yes."
"What was the boy doing in that lane, Detective?"
Soliciting.
So he was a lawyer?
(Some giggling)
He was performing oral sex.
So he was a male prostitute?
"Who were his clients, Detective?"
"Uh, beautiful fashion models?"
Romanian princesses?
Men.
"Plump, wheezing, sweaty middle-aged men with 50 bucks to spare."
I wouldn't know.
"How many men (clears throat) had he transacted that evening, Detective?"
We don't know.
Several.
Several.
"So is that six, seven?"
- Quiet!
Never mention that again!
( softly ) Look.
"Did you like me better when I was blonde, with baby-fat?"
Or later when I was brunette and thin?
I liked you when you were blonde and thin.
Hitler: ...fulfillment of a mysterious longing.
My need to control will fill others' need to be controlled.
That was my euphoric discovery:
the union of my urges with the German people's desires!
"If you unite a powerful people, whose first duty is obedience,"
you can do anything.
( whispers ) God... I love to order.
"Every woman a potential source of solace, warmth, love."
"Every man, a rival."
Hitler:
"""l am the German spirit."
"Consider the incomparable magic of my works..."""
Did you write that?
"""...the incomparable magic of my works."""
It's Wagner.
"""Man is a beast of prey, developing through constant progress."
"The beast conquers, founds great realms by the subjugation of other subjugators, forms states and organizes civilizations, in order to enjoy his booty in peace."
"Attack and defense, suffering and struggle, domination and servitude."""
Are those Wagner's words?
We were both illusionists and showmen.
"I made my life so different, so vibrant, so extreme."
That was how... I accumulated power.
I wrapped iron and blood in a cloud of mystic communion with the German Volk.
"Whoever wants to understand Hitler, must first learn Wagner."
Write this!

Where's my watch?
"Is there a problem, Pasha?"
"My wallet, there were 900 pounds in it"
"I was robbed, Fanouss"
that girl took everything she took my sister Dawlat's ring
and took a set of gold plated pens what will a prostitute do with gold plated pens?
"She'll either sell it or give it to her lover, let's call the police"
What police?
Are you stupid?
What am I going to tell them?
"I don't care about the money the problem is Dawlat's ring, I have to get it back"
"""Oh my love, I'm full of confusion... and fire"""
"Good evening, Pasha, at your service"

- Won't I do?
"You'll do, but I want Rabab for something private"
"She's off today, and I'm at your service"

- The manager?
- won't you drink anything?
- Get me the manager

There is no Brandy
"Will you pay here, or would you rather go to the bathroom..."
"- What do you want, Pasha?"
- and we'll make you pay...
- I want Rabab
- Wasn't she with you today?
- you miss her already?

The world's coral reefs begin to collapse even before two degrees.
DICAPRIO:
"And we're predicted to hit 1.5, to 2 degrees."
So.

Already now.
So.

That's already probably gonna happen.
ROCKSTROM:
That's already probably gonna happen.
"At 3, 4 degrees, we will have heat waves which makes many regions in the world not livable any longer."
Agriculture will be collapsing around the equator.
That would take us beyond being able to responsibly feed humanity.
What makes scientists so nervous is that we can reach a point where earth takes over and starts reinforcing warming.
"This is what we call tipping points, and the most obvious one is Greenland."
"Greenland, for the first time, is melting on its entire surface to a point where, instead of being a white surface, becomes a dark surface, and suddenly instead of becoming a cooler, becomes a self‐heater."
DICAPRIO:
"Because, because of the fact the ice can no longer reflect back."
ROCKSTROM:
Just the color change.
DICAPRIO:
Just the color change of the ice.
ROCKSTROM:
"Suddenly, all these feedbacks start kicking in."
Methane stuck under frozen permafrost thaws to a point where it starts getting released.
DICAPRIO:
"And that in turn warms the planet even more, which releases more methane."
ROCKSTROM:
Correct.

That's if we don't take immediate action.

"I am Jocelyn Bennett, and we are at the Skirt Magazine headquarters... i.e., where fashion trends are invented."
How about how you got here.
"Well, I think I took my school model a little bit too serious."
When I was taught not to be served but to serve...
I think they had God's delivery in mind... and not fashion magazines.
"I could be in the staff of ""Glamour""... but I'd rather be an intern at Skirt."
I like to think of myself as a missionary to salvage the tacky.

We get inside along with him

I will die with no complaints
I have one more request
If I win I get to take the girl as well

Something... we can't control?

"By feeding them hope, you stimulated their craving."
Yes... the desire to be the desired object.

You were the one thing... that brought me peace.
I told you to destroy that footage!

Make your excuse to the police
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what and why and where?
Let him give a full description Let him answer to Javert
"Javert, would you believe it?"
I was lost here in the dark
When this prostitute attacked me You can see she left her mark
She will answer for her actions If you make a full report
"You may rest assured, monsieur She will answer to the court"
There's a child who sorely needs me
"Please, monsieur, she's but that high"
"Holy God, is there no mercy?"
If I go to jail she'll die
I have heard such protestations every day for 20 years
Let's have no more explanations
"Save your breath, save your tears"
"Honest work, just reward"
That's the way to please the Lord
"A moment of your time, Javert I do believe this woman's tale"
Monsieur le Mayor!
"You've done your duty, let her be"
"She needs a doctor, not a jail"
Monsieur le Mayor!
Can this be?
Where will she end
"No, beer causes flatulence"
- and makes me urinate a lot
- Why don't you order whiskey?
Whiskey?
"If I drink whiskey I'll stay here and I'll go out and find it dark, and it'll stay dark"
"You're very funny, Pasha, why not go to the hotel bars?"
"I mean 5 star bars, you can afford it"
"Listen, It's not the alcohol I'm after"
- and you know that
- I'm still thinking about it
"It doesn't need thinking, we'll have a couple of drinks together"
That's all?
That's all
"In that case, I should come by your office, right?"
- When?
- Whenever I'm in the mood
Tomorrow...
Go get me the check
At your service
"Send 6 crates, but more beer because it's in demand"
"Yes, but don't be late"
The check for table 9
- What's with that table 9?
"- Make up you mind... if I'm straight with customers, you tell me to be nicer with them"
"He's respectable and generous, what's wrong with talking to him?"
"Listen, I don't like anything to happen behind my back"
"That goes here only, but on the outside, I'm free"
I'll go give him his check
"OK, go"
"What is it, Taha?"
Are you stupid like your father?
No one washes the stairs at this hour
That guy is brushing his hand
Perhaps he is brushing his dentures
Look there
A beautiful woman like Iyengar's bakery's bun
Come let us see
Customers are coming in car to our shop
"Welcome, What do you want?"
Three packets of 'Murukku'
One packet of 'Kamarkattu'
Does this look like a snack bar to you?
Is this not a petty shop?
Look behind Kamatchi Silver Sales
Will you open only on Friday?
"OK, note down the list 1 kilo toe rings, 3/4 kilo nose screws and 1/4 kilo ear rings"
"Look, this contains Acid"
If I splashed it on your face It will be a bloodbath
Who are you and what do you want?
We have moved to the opposite house
I am Kanmani And she is Neelaveni
I am Thankam Will roar like a lion
But will look ugly
They deliberately pick up quarrel on arrival
"Mani, does it take so much time for shopping?"
I told you not to call me with the masculine name Mani
You have pierced my nose also at an young age
If you don't like it Remove the nose screw
But how can I close the hole?
Close it with calcium
If you call me Mani again I won't mind you are my mom
-I will punch you
-Will you?
Invite neighbours for tomorrow's house warming
"And he asked for it, anyway"
You're not a killer
"Stop thinking about it, Angela you're not a killer"
What are you planning to do?
Are you getting married with Pablo?
I don't think so that just ties you too much
But if you're living with a man you're surely tied to him
"No, because at any point if you want to split, you split"
But you can split even after being married
"At the very end, what's marriage"
"A priest, a blessing, a piece of paper"
Definitely not
Do you want to smoke one?
OK
Look at them they're driving like crazy
And then something goes wrong you cant leave them all alone
They're driving like crazy
Because they're desperate to get home
So the wife opens the door
Gives them little kiss
And asks 'How was your day at work?
"and they say 'Fine, I'm just a little tired'"
Then she turns the TV on
Start arguing with the son
If a son dares to punch me I swear I'd kill him
I'm going to the sea
Who comes to the sea with me?
"I'm also going, eh"
I can't go now
I have to fix a few things
"You blew it, kid"
Wait for me there
No faulty circuits I can find.
Just no power.
"Damage control, report."
"All systems report normal, captain."
No ascertainable damage.
- Then what is it?
"- I don't know, sir,"
"- but whatever it is, we cannot move."
"- We're being held in place, captain."
Apparently from that solar system.
This far out?
That's impossible.
We are being held.
- Tractor beams?
"- No, sir."
An unidentifiable power.
We are the Metrons.
You are one of two crafts which have come into our space on a mission of violence.
This is not permissible.
Yet we have analyzed you and have learned that your violent tendencies are inherent.
So be it.
We will control them.
We will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities.
Captain James Kirk.
This is Kirk.
We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere.
"You will be taken there, as will the captain of the Gorn ship which you have been pursuing."
There you will settle your dispute.
I don't understand.
"You will be provided with a recording translating device in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system, but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship."
You will each be totally alone.
What makes you think you can interfere..?

This is the vault where thousands upon thousands of MGM films are stored.
"Their worth in dollars, film history, entertainment is immeasurable."
"There are a few of these, of course, in which I appeared."
"This one, Rose Marie was the first wide-screen, CinemaScope musical."
"Now, in the 1950s, Hollywood went into a panic that rivaled the advent of talking pictures."
A monster had taken over the movie-going public:
Television.
"So the movies went into new technologies such as CinemaScope, stereophonic sound to try to recapture their audience."
Today to get the public To attend a picture show
It's not enough to advertise A famous star they know
If you want to get the crowds To come around
You gotta have glorious Technicolor
Breathtaking Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound
"In Silk Stockings, Janis Paige and Fred Astaire spoof the necessary elements to make a modern motion picture."
How do you feel about advertisement companies succession?

"creating value by producing CMs providing more fun, more revolution as well as providing a new value to lifestyle that's the importance and job of an advertisement company"

"No, you must understand"
"Zaki, will never enter this apartment again... as long as I live, and even after I die"
"OK, just relax and listen"
- I don't want to hear anything

All that are to be done with fingers..
..are done with your sight
By age you are so young
But you are broad-minded than your age
You got 1 0 fingers
Why only one finger is sweet?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
My shyness is missing Was it you who stole it?
So far I lived in solitude like mercury..
.. which won't allow anything to stick
Like a silent shadow you fell into my mind
Will go much deeper inside and will take the treasure from your heart
- You got 1 0 fingers
- I got 1 0 fingers
-Only one finger is..
-..
Sweet but why?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
Oh bee of the bamboo forest The crab that jerks my brain
Am I the feast to contain the starvation of your 1 0 fingers
Oh Bandit darling The girl who commit light murders
Will I leave if you keep away?
You are obliged to hide your arrogant beauty
Plucking without unveiling the screen is my ability
Hiding the beauty is cruelty
Don't twist our hips Go straight
What a nice scene in the early morning
Eyes would remain intact if I could see it daily
- I will give you one slap
-I will give two on your cheeks
We should honour the traditional routines
Sit down
Though my daughter has gone for an independent house
Her in law's place is this only
When my son married your daughter on that day
"I was worried that you would block it on the grounds, that he has been imprisoned"
If I were to do that I should do that for my hubby also
Kanmani's dad is in Rangoon jail
"Two years ago, in a business scuffle"
He attacked him and was jailed
Now my brother is looking after that business
Next year he will be released from jail
"Till date, even my daughters don't know about this"
Who has not done wrongs?
Circumstances make them do so
"Auntie come, Are you fine?"
- I am fine
We have a tradition to name the new daughter in law at our family temple
What is it?
"Before God, you would be named again when can we go?"
That is for those who marry at a different place
I have married her at our temple
That can be done later
-Not that
- Dear..
listen to me
Aunty wants us to do some naming at temple
Why do you refuse?
Don't you know what it is?
I don't know
I will smack you you were asking about it to sister in law
How do you know that?
Look your eyesight is fading
You see me but only as a shadow
Look you've become so weak
You cannot touch my soul
Surely you can hear someone's voice
Surely you can hear the call of music
Who is calling out to us?
Let's find out
So what if the road is lonely?
So what if the night is as silent as a tomb?
Let's be together always
We have weathered so many storms together
So what if we have to weather some more storms?
Let's take two more steps towards our infinite destination
Is life a thought?
Or the search of a thought?
The wayward foolfoolfoolishness of the heart
The unfaithfulness of the heart
O beauty don't ask me why or where.
Just take me away with you
Life is a secret a deep secret
Why unlock the secret?
"Someone unknown, walked silentfooted into my life"
And I didn't even know how a moment changed into 400 long nights and three stories
Like I didn't know how Meenaxi was born from the womb of the book
This life is so strange
Is this life just another book?
Who are you?
I am Meenaxi

A large troop of Jin soldiers will arrive soon

Why so many mobile phones?
Are you running a brothel?
All guys are caught with mobile phones
Sit down
Heard you would kill me if I contest elections
How many you have killed so far?
Do you know about me?
You are a big rowdy and is eking out a living with a sickle
"Don't yearn for it after dawn, you will have it"
Give your concurrence with fondness
On a white horse I will come majestically
"Coimbatore girl, I will run away with you"
"Even if you beg, I will not let you go"
Why do you behave arrogantly?
Why do you unnecessarily wag?
I will not lose the hide and seek game
Even if you beg I will not give myself
If I kiss you like ants Sweet sugarcane what will you do?
You are showing all your skills and trying to gauge me
Shall I come near shall I come near you?
- Shall I contain you?
- Gosh!
"Sudaamani, you are blowing hot"
"Don't rage, you have become red"
You are threatening me like a rogue
Injuring my cheeks with your moustache
You are a hot betel leaf
Oh my dear!
Oh my dear!
Has your desire not subsided?
Has your moustache not drooped?
Male hands are always naughty
If a girl is near males will try to fondle her
You are stirring my age
You are churning my mind
"Women always talk more when they see males, talk innuendo's"
If housewife become adamant what will you do?
Even if you do mistake will fondle you and enjoy
"If you are not alert, will bite your ear"
You are a ruffian and are trying to steal
He is a water lily blossomed in the night
He has come here hopping
He will win the elections.......
- You have defied me and conducting the meeting
- Who are you?
"Just see, now there will be a power failure"
-Where are you?

Driver stop the car
"Arul leave me, I know only about daggers and sickle"
I don't know about bombs I will go
"Ok, I will let you live"
Start the vehicle quickly
That guy got admitted in hospital
Then people went raving about Palayamkottai Kasilingam
But he has also run away fearing your brother
"I bid confess their sins, a fair array,"
"Communicate in such fashions, all,"
As if they were the ensuing day to fall.
"The larum-bells, loud-sounding through the air,"
"Stricken with frequent blows, the town affray;"
And in the crowded temples everywhere
Movement of lips and hands upraised to pray.
"And now with folded hands and face supine,"
I say:
O Lord!
"although my sins be grave,"
"Permit not, that, in this their utmost need,"
Thy people suffer for their king's misdeed!
"That thou art without power, the foe will cry,"
Because thou lett'st thy faithful people die.
"From behind me, let all ye paynims stun"
"Fair France with hostile din and angry cry,"
"In this very day, I, Troyano's son"
The holy empire in my wrath defy.
"And boastful Africa, with vengeful doom,"
"Gives Paris to the flames, and levels Rome."
For the assault let now our strong band form;
We will ourselves go forth with them that storm.
"Here may you paladin and baron ken,"
"King, duke, and marquis, count and chivalry,"
"And soldier, foreigner or citizen,"
Ready for honour and for Christ to die;
"We, eager to assail the Saracen,"
"On thee, Sire, to lower the bridges cry."
Let the paladins break the Saracen!
"I do witness with joy your martial heat,"
But to permit your sally deem not meet.
There's actually a class of diseases
"Called ""hospital-acquired infections,"""
Which you get while you're at a hospital being treated for something else.
Antibiotic resistance has been a problem for a very long time.
"What is different now than before is that in the past,"
We always had another antibiotic
That would bail us out of the problem of resistance.
We don't have that luxury anymore.
We're out in some instances.
There are patients for whom we have no antibiotics.
These are nightmare bacteria
That have now developed resistance
To every single antibiotic that we have available to us.
"So, what happened?"
Why did we stop discovering as many new antibiotics?
The development of new antibiotics got a lot harder.
The easier targets for antibiotics were all discovered and exploited.
"So if we don't keep up on the other side of the equation with drug discovery,"
We will continue to find ourselves challenged more and more
With infections that we can't treat.
Morton:
"As traditional lab-based research yields fewer and fewer new antibiotics,"
Science has turned its attention to one of the planet's
Last natural pharmacopoeias...
Caves.
Put your weight on the rope.

Morton:
"This cave is fucking enormous, jesus christ."
This is insane.
"This is cagle cave in, uh, tennessee."
Brian is coming down on the next rope behind me.
I've been here nearly three weeks:
We'd better get you aboard the Searcher:
We can't do anything for you down here:
Let's take him to my starfighter:
"I'll take him upstairs, and that way, you two can finish the survey:"
Okay:
Thank you very much:
It's very kind of you:
I'd about given up hope:
"All you all right, Mr:"
Reardon?
"Fine, thanks:"
"Let's take a look at those ruins while we still got some light left, all right?"
[Hawk] The ship:
[Buck] It's gone:
Vanished:
Perhaps we have mistakenly come to another clearing:
"No, this is the right clearing, all right:"
There's no doubt about that:
"Everything is gone... the ship, the shelter, the campfire, everything:"
Vanished:
"[Man Narrating] In the year 1987,"
NASA launched the last of America's deep space probes:
"Aboard this compact starship, a lone astronaut, Captain William ""Buck'""Rogers, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension:"
"In a freak mishap, his life-support systems were frozen: : :"
By temperatures beyond imagination:
Ranger 3 was blown out of its planned trajectory: : :
"Into an orbit 1,000 times more vast, an orbit which was to return Buck Rogers to Earth: : :"
500 years later:
What could possibly have caused Reardon's shuttle to disappear?
I don't know:
Maybe we'll find out further on:
That would mean a change of mood
Didn't go with Mr. Monotony
Sometimes he would change the key
But the same dull melody
Would emerge from Mr. Monotony
Folks for miles would run away
Only one preferred to stay
She would come around and say
"""Have you got any monotony today?"""
"""Haven't got any monotony"
Today
Can't play
Today
Haven't got any monotony
"Today"""
It only happens when I dance with you
Another legend at Metro was my good friend Fred Astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures.
"In Easter Parade, it was the one and only Ann Miller."
Seem quite so near
"Why does it happen, dear"
Only with you?
Two cheeks together can be so divine
But only when those cheeks
Are yours and mine
I've danced with dozens of others
The whole night through
But the thrill that comes with Spring
When anything could happen
That only happens with you
It was at a rehearsal hall like this that I spent my first days at MGM preparing for the production numbers in Easter Parade.
"Oh, and I was just scared stiff because I was going to dance with the master."
But Fred Astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away.
For almost one full minute during that time?
"Sir, there was a minor malfunction in the plasma gyros:"
We had it corrected in no time and resumed our proper course:
It was all routine:
"I'll tell you what's routine, mister!"
You steered this ship from her true course: : :
In a deliberate attempt to sabotage our mission:
Sabotage?
"That's enough out of you, Cowan:!"
Lieutenant Parsons!
"Yes, sir:"
Take charge of the prisoner:
Chief Petty Officer Cowan is to remain under close arrest in the brig: : :
Until further word from me:!
"Yes, sir:"
I don't believe this is happening:
Cowan is completely trustworthy:
He wouldn't sabotage the ship:
Take him away:
The admiral must be losing his mind:
Parsons is acting like some kind of two-bit tyrant:
It's totally unlike him:
But what could be responsible for such a bizarre transformation?
I don't know:
It's hard to say:
But we came back to see if Reardon had anything useful he could tell us:
I still think that's the best place to start:
Let's go:
[Asimov] Don't think for a moment that you can lie to me and get away with it:
Mr:
"Miller, I have reason to believe: : :"
That you have conspired to tamper with the fusion drive of this ship:
Never come back
Go away

Finally
This is Mia
Tell your whore to go away before I slap her
I only sleep with virgins and even then only once
See you next month
Come on girls
Move Come on
I love your work
This is exactly what we need here
"When a client sees a sexy and hot painting he gets more excited, and when he gets excited he pays more money quicker"
The right painting here can double our income
This is the biggest painting we have ever commisioned and I will pay you in gold but you must capture something beautiful the painting must show the best ass like Hanna's
Great bosoms
Long great legs and beautiful hair
Look at this great face and lips
and have you ever seen such a beautiful little sweet oster?
I want to experience everything life has to offer
I want to meet a special man
If only my father and mother alive
Your mother was a whore and your father a whoremonger
You have a new commission?
Yes but it is going to be difficult
Shall I look for models?
See what you can find
You have been living off your father for long enough
We can no longer tolerate your sin in this house
This one is a sailor
Arise
"Hero Man, some people stormed the execution area?"
Yes
You have failed to guard it
"Your Majesty, of the nine prisoners they only freed one... and left the others"
They've been at a disadvantage
Hero Man... the Jin have Prince Kang as hostage and are in an advantageous position
It is a great responsibility to guard him ...and it falls on you
"Don't worry, with him under my guard there'll be no problem"
Award hero Man 500 taels of gold... and 50 horses
Yes
"Thank you, your Majesty"
"Among the Princes of Sung,"
Prince Kang is the most smart
The others are slow-witted and can cause no harm
As long as we retain him
We will sure win
Why don't we just kill him?
"It is easy to conquer, but difficult to rule"
"After we devour Sung, we have much use for him"
You wouldn't know about this
Yes
You can lie down and speak
"There are so many of you, how come you were wiped out?"
All have been killed
"Nine of us were captured and escorted to the execution site, I..."
We will go again
Tell us about the situation in Jin
We went in two groups
I was in the first group
Hero Ting Siu led us... and came to the river side
Where are the boats?
Why would you say so my Sultana?
Wat if they attack to our palace again thinking they are icons
Who can dare it
These sculptures are his Majesty's gift for me
Don't worry my Sultana
All these can't be coincidence
"Seeing these sculptures, bringing them here is a sign"
"A magnificent future is waiting for us, my Sultana"
Especially the sculptures will be the guards of our happiness
My sword trainer says that we'll start to train fighting on a horse
"You promised me, I'll join you at the next campaign"
I'll be a cruel warrior
I appreciate your determination my Mustafa
But...
What's more important than being a cruel warrior is being a equitable warrior
The books I told you about are delivered
We'll view them after friday praying
"How can I understand infidel's language, your Majesty?"
İbrahim Paşa will help you
You will learn Italian and Latin in the same way you learnt Arabic and Persian
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim
What the heck is this?

Got it

Arul has entered the party office and is assaulting all
What are you doing there?
In the name of party have you not swindled public money?
No one should be inside Drive them all out
Thanks Arul You have got back my house for me
This is the house document.
Give back when I return from Delhi
People's party office has been encroached by you
I have received complaints to this effect
"We know, who has send you And why you have come"
"See this, the agreement we have signed with the house owner"
Stop it
He is asking us to vacate the shop
And is atrociously attacking us
If you extract money in the name of exorbitant interest
"I will kick you, your leader and party men in the streets"
Go away
"In today's circumstances, running the mill is very difficult"
"Sethupathy's men demanded party funds, election funds"
And has troubled us a lot
Because we didn't give money They have instigated
Workmen to go on strike against the management
They forced us to pay unwanted taxes
Today Arul is opposing sethupathy
We must rally behind him
Must provide him money and support
"Look, the party office colour has changed"
Take her inside
What is all this?
Though the marriage was not done formally
Why shouldn't I?
"I understand, but-"
My uncle is here

"And I would ask her, I would say,"
"""Man, why are you saying this?"
There are people that are listening in.

"You mean to tell me that there's nobody listening to the ideas I'm trying to convey and you know, things I'm trying to do,"" and, no."
"No, she said."
So...
"I mean, and now that all this--"
"It's not the first time this kind of shit has happened, so I kind of gotten closer to mywife because of that man."
"Even though she didn't believe what I was doing, she still stood by me."
"She still, you know, accepted the fact that I was in another room while she was attending to whatever she was attending to and it just puts life into perspective that I don't want to end up like"
"Bright Bart and all these other people that, they made small dents in an attempt to... to try to..."
"I guess, make some kind of change or expose some sort of contradiction or expose hypocracy, but I just want to live life, baby."
You know aht I mean?
"I just wanted to live life, that's all there is to it, man."
So... anyway.
"Open mic, not in my office."
I'm talking about when I was outside my office work.
"I'm talking about when I spent time in here, you know what I mean?"
"I've been spending a lot of time in the chatroom here outside of the show, you knwo what I'm saying?"
"So, I mean that's time away from my wife."
"I mean, look, you know, my traditional office hourse are my traditional office hours, but when I'm at home at, you know, 8, 9 PM, 3 AM, early in the morning,"
"I mean, you know... she's here, she's here now."
You know what I mean and you know she's...
"I just feel bad that I sat here and neglected her unconditional companionship and instead, being politcally, but not really political, but I guess romantic in another direction, you know aht I mean?"
"So, I think I'm gonna spend a lot more time with her, man, and not only that, my family, my family that I've discussed, you know what I mean?"
"So, in my personal opinion, it's over man."
There's nothing I can do.
"There's nothing I can do, I've done everything."
The world is the way it is.
"I've got a few years left, a few good years left,"
"I've got some pretty good years left in me, so might as well-- like I said,"
"This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it."
"And I said, ""Well, what exactly is the process?"""
"And they said, ""The band is applied to the tail, tightly."
"And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly."
Blood flow is slowly retarded; a week later the parts in question fall off.
"""Great -- got it."""
"OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it."
"I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it."
"OK, that's basically how you do it."
So the next day I go out.
"And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry."
Melanie is the wife of Albert.
Albert is the shepherd in question.
"Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left."
"Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up."
Alright.
Great.
"Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
"Being an apprentice, you know, you do that."
"Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife."
"And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know."
"And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive."
"In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding."
"A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp."
"And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip."
"Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?"
"He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding."
Can we roll the video?
No I'm kidding -- we don't -- (Laughter)
I thought it best to talk in pictures.
"So, I do something now I've never ever done on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever."

"So, the celebrities and all the movie stars and music people, they look amazing, right?"
"They have beautiful skin, white straight teeth, and gorgeous hair."
What do they use?
"Well, I know what they use."
"That's right, some of the companies and I, we've worked together and found out exactly what these celebrities and movie stars and all these famous people are using and I have some of those products to share with you today."
"So what I have is iLike, so if it's good enough for the queen, I say it's good enough for me and you."
"Queen Latifah, Rich Carrot Mask, that is what she uses."
"It is a great mask for anti-aging, to give you antioxidants."
"I mean, if you know how good carrots are for you internally, just imagine what those carotenes are doing for your skin on external, so the iLike Rich Carrot Mask works good enough for Queen Latifah;"

And Epicuren's Skincare...
Kate Bosworth loves herself some X-Treme Cream SPF45.
"This is one of my favorites, and I'm gonna keep using this in the wintertime, because, when I go to the park, even though it's winter, we still need to wear sunscreen, okay?"
"I know some of you are thinking, ""Oh, believe me, I don't need it where I live,"" but, most likely, you do."
"Even if it's cloudy out, there's still rays that are getting through, so wear sunscreen."
I'm always gonna preach that.
"And I love this as well, this is off my bathroom counter."
"Again, Epicuren Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer."
This is loved by Gwen Stafani and we all know that she looks amazing.
"This is a body product, so a lot of body products are just hydating/nourishing-type products."
"Well, this, the difference is Epicuren's After Bath has anti-aging ingredients in it, so you're putting on anti-aging moisturizer on your body, which, those of us know, our arms, our shoulders, our neck, our décolleté probably could use some of that."
"And, Kim Cattrall, she loves Epicuren."
"She, you can quote her on this, she uses Epicuren Skin Regime at least once a week, a full Epicuren Skin Regime."
"I have the Ultra Rose in my hand, and this is an amazing moisturizer, super-super hydrating, as well."
Love Epicuren.
"Image Skincare, a lot of movie stars are starting to use this product more and more."

least square you minimize this.
Whether it's the two or the one norm.
"So really that corresponds to, the only thing I really gotta minimize is this."
"This stuff is always the same, so if I can minimize that some, that's all I care about."
"So there's this thing called fminsearch In Matlab, which allows you to just give it an expression, and it will try to minimize, and you give it some initial values, to try to say, hey, try these and then go find me a minimum solution."
'Kay?
"So that's what we're going to use, fminsearch."
All right.
"So, we come into here and here's how it works."
"We want the coefficients, using an L2 fit, the coefficients meaning a and b."
"And want to call the fminsearch, command."
"And want to call a function called line, L2 fit."
"And well we've gotta pass it, or the initial guesses for the values of A and B. I'll just pick one."
"And I'. gonna pass it the data X and Y. The box here is for tolerence settings, just allow you to make it, get more accurate fi, or less accurate fit. the default is ten minus six."
"It's gonna try to get you the minimum, and once it gets, it's, it's an iteration routine, and once you get down to 10-6, it stops, 'kay?"
"So, ther e you go, that's how you do it."
"You send in your, you send in your data, you send in your initial guess for A and B, and what is gonna come out are two numbers, A and B. That, it thinks, so the minimum, give you the minimum values for those things."
"Okay, now we can do this without one by simply changing two:1."
"So we're gonna do two this, we're gonna first call F and then search, and use, yeah, two, minimization, and then we're gonna call F and search."
A one immunization.
"Now, it turns out, it's kinda like the cooking show today."
"Where,"
"like, you know, oh, you put it in the oven for 50 minutes and, you know, all of a sudden, right at that point, they pop one out."
"It's all planned as if, as if it wasn't spontaneous."
"Okay, so we're not going spontaneous today."
"We're going to go get these , they're sitting right there."
"There's one of them and let me get the other one, and then we'll talk about them."
"Where is it L2 fit, okay."
Alright.
"So what are they, what are these subroutines."
"Well, here they are."
They're actually quite simple.
And it is really helpful for me as a teacher.
"I read once somewhere, that we make more decisions  during the course of our work day than any other professions  except surgeons."
No wonder we are so exhausted  at the end of the day.
"So, taking that time for me  with my students at the start of the classes  is tremendously helpful."
I also do deep relaxation with them.
"I actually only want to do it  once every two weeks because of training, we have so much  that we need to go through, but they put together a petition  that said ""We want deep relaxation at least once a week""."
"Beginning anew is another practice  that you are going to learn about, and I use that to mediate conflict and  also I use it with my students when I want one-on-one conference with them."
"So, we have a clean slate with each other and also own up for any unskillfulness I've had."
That is the authenticity piece.
"Naming, when you yourself  as a teacher have been unskillful,"
I think it is really powerful.
"The practice of loving kindness, often times, I also start the class with that."
"I'm really happy... (Bell) to be here and hear more questions about integrating practice into classroom, you can feel free to find me anytime."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Meena."
"Our third speaker is Michele Chaban,  also from the University of Toronto."

She is the one who got it going.
"Michele, why don't you share with us?"
"(Michele Chaban) Good afternoon everybody, I'd like to begin with offering a blessing to you, for those of you who are teachers formally and for the rest of us  who teach informally."
May you be well.
May you be healthy.
May you be whole everyday.
May you be happy.
May you be supported  from within and above you.
"And may you continue  with your good work, because together we will change the world."
I am so pleased to be here  with you today.
"I guess we have been asked to speak  a little bit about ourselves,so here I go."
I used to be a model for Elizabeth Art  in Canada and it was a wonderful life.
"And one day, a drunk-driver ran into me  and took my legs and my arms away from me."
"And in years that ensued,  I lost my ability to talk and walk."
I kept my mind andI lost my body.
And science didn't have the resources to be able to help heal me and I waited.
"We're saying that it's a negative emotion because it does, and I've seen it many times, actually stop a person's growth for weeks, for years."
"You're disabled for the time that you're grieving, until there usually comes a time when you transcend that, you go through it, past it."
"And the quicker that happens, the better.."
I would say.
And certainly if you look in the Buddhist texts the grief was never encouraged by the Buddha.
"He would always actually say that the wise person is beyond that grief, could understand the nature of life and death, and in that understanding could let that nature be."
And never fight battles which you can't win.
"There's a famous Buddhist story, it's in the Dhammapada, I'll just go on with this, it's a man who cried for the moon."
"A man who lost his only son, and would go to the cremation ground every evening to cry and cry and cry, and his family let him cry for a while."
"But when he was crying overmuch they wanted to find some way of overcoming his grief which was going on far too long, ruining his health and his business as I've seen happen."
"They hired an actor and the actor went to the cremation ground also, and the actor was crying more than the father who'd lost his son."
"When they met together, these two men crying their eyes out, the actor crying more, the actor asked, ""what are you crying for?"" He said, ""I've"
lost my son.
"He's dead..""."
"""What are you crying for,"" said the father to the actor."
"""I'm crying for the moon""."
"""What do you mean, crying for the moon?"" ""It's my birthday last week, and my father asked me - what do you want?"
And I said I want the moon please.
"And my father wouldn't get it for me, and I'm so upset.. I'm crying for the moon."" And the father said,"
"""You're stupid."
You're crazy!
Why are you crying for?
"No-one can give you the moon!"""
"""You call me crazy,"" said the actor, ""You're crying for your dead son."
At least you can see the moon!
"Where is your dead son?"" [laughter]."
"And at that, this is a story, an old story, in the Buddhist texts, at that, the man realised what he was doing, he was crying for something you can never get."
Grieving for something which you can't change.
"And that was enough for him to stop his grief, go back to work, and move on with his life."
"The story of the man who cried for the moon, in the Dhammapada."
"But as for John Howard, yeah we respect him, but we crack jokes about him."
People crack jokes about everybody in Australia.
"He was, I think, a great friend to students across the campus."

Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power.
"And you might say, hold on a second."
We know how to take the derivative of e to the x.
But what about a base like 2?
We don't know what to do with 2.
And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power.
And the key there is to rewrite 2.
So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power?
"Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is."
The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2.
"So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2."
"So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e."
"We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power."
So this is the x power in yellow.
And so let's do that right over here.
"So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power."
"Let me put this x in that same color, dx."
"Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers."
Let me rewrite this just to remember.
"If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power."
"Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him."
He's making a great living.
"You ask him, ""Did you follow your passion here?"" and he'd laugh at you."
"The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas."
He didn't follow his passion.
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.
And I hear that story over and over.
"Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots."
"Now, he's selling them to Walmart."
Follow his passion?
The guy's -- come on.
"So I started to look at passion,"
"I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness -- as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction."
"I started to look at teamwork and determination, and basically all those platitudes they call ""successories"" that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now."
That stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
Safety -- safety first?
"Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?"
"I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third?"
Right?
(Laughter)
"No, I mean really."
"What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first."
"They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done."
"And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season."
We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:
"50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?"
"Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down."
"So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean."
Unspeakably dangerous.
"I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity,"
"""Captain, OSHA."""
"And he says, ""OSHA?"
"let's say it's this one fourth of the pie, right?"
And we're going to add it to another one fourth of the pie.
Let's make it this one-- let me change the color-- pink.
"This one fourth, this pink one fourth is this one fourth of the pie."
"So if I were to eat both one fourths, or one fourth and then I eat another one fourth, how much have I eaten?"
"Well, you could look from just the picture,"
I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pie.
"So if I eat one fourth of a piece of pie or one fourth of a pie, and then I eat another one fourth of a pie,"
I will have eaten two fourths of the pie.
"And we know from the equivalent fractions module that this is the same thing as that I've eaten one half of the pie, which makes sense."
"If I eat two out of four pieces of a pie, then I've eaten one half of it."
"And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here?"
"Well the denominators or the bottom numbers, the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same."
Because that's just the total number of pieces that I have in this example.
"Well, I added the numerators, which makes sense."
"I had one out of the four pieces of pie, then I ate another one out of the four pieces of pie, so I ate two out of the four pieces of pie, which is one half."
Let me do a couple more examples.
What is two fifths plus one fifth?
Well we do the same thing here.
We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.
We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different.
"If the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same."
"And we just add the numerators. two fifths plus one fifth is just two plus one over five, which is equal to three over five."
And it works the same way with subtraction.
"If I had three over seven minus two over seven, that just equals one over seven."
"I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one and I kept the denominator the same."
Which makes sense.
"If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie, and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,"
I'd be left with one of the seven pieces of a pie.
So now let's tackle-- I think it should be pretty straightforward when we have the same denominator.
"Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction."
Numerator is the top number.
"And as I learned how these other countries had either not allowed these ingredients, or insisted on labeling, believing that their citizens had a right to know about these ingredients in the food,"
I couldn't unlearn this information.
"And I know correlation isn't causation, but we have one of the highest cancer rates on the planet."
The American Academy of Pediatrics has linked pesticides to ADHD and hyperactivity in kids.
"And the President's Cancer Panel has recently urged all of us to reduce our exposure to these chemicals in an effort to try to prevent the onset of these diseases, which according to the New England Journal of Medicine is placing an increasing burden on our economy."
"And I got it, it was a business model."
"But at the same time, I couldn't unlearn this."
And I struggled with what people might call me.
I'd dismissed it as a hippie thing;
lifestyle of the rich and famous.
And I really didn't want to put my face on this movement.
"And yet I sat across the table one night from my husband and I said, ""I can't unlearn this."""
"And so we sat the kids down the next morning, and I said, ""You know how mom's learned about how we have all these ingredients in our food and we didn't know?"
"I'm going to have to try to teach others about it."""
"And one of the boys looked at me and he said,"
"""Mom, how many people are on your team?"""
(Laughter)
"And I said, ""Well, it's you four... and daddy."""
(Laughter)
"And he said, ""Mom, you need a bigger team."""
(Laughter)
"And people were telling me to reach out to Erin Brockovich; they were saying, ""You're food's Erin Brockovitch."""
And people were telling me to reach out to Bobby Kennedy because he was really involved with food politics.
"And I'm from a conservative family, (Laughter) and I thought, ""I can't."""
(Laughter)
"But at the same time, I thought, ""You know, I have to at least try, and I do have all of these type A genes."""
"And so I harnessed them, and I spent a couple of weeks around the Christmas of 2006 drafting a very short e-mail to Erin Brockovitch."
"And when she actually responded,"
"I thought, ""You know, maybe one person can make a difference."""
"Then later that spring, I took all of the data and of the research that I had done, and I spent a good two weeks in a Kinko's office binding it, and shipping it off to Bobby Kennedy."
"And when his Chief of Staff called, she had me on speakerphone."
"And to this day, I still don't know who was in that room, but she said,"
"Senator Harkin has been a key defender of the program, chairs the Senator Appropriations Subcommittee."
He will be retiring.
He will be here for two years.
"That's going to be a big, big change."
"In the House, Congressman Rehberg of Montana has been the chair."
Montana is a big CSBG state.
"It's a very, very important program there."
I think something like 10% of the population are beneficiaries of it.
"Of course Jim Nolan now retired, a great advocate for CSBG had helped with Congressman Rehberg who was defeated in his run for the Senate."
So the new Chair of the Labor HHS subcommittee is going to be very powerful for the future of CSBG.
"A gentleman by the name of Jack Kingston comes from Savannah, Georgia."
"How do you, Arley and Mark, see over the past several years, the approps process has unraveled."
CSBG has gone onto a continuing resolution which actually has helped CSBG because it forced all the cuts.
"What do you see happening this year with the change with Rehberg gone with a new Chairman who perhaps is not interested in CSBG to the degree that Rehberg was, how do you see that playing out in the approps process?"
"Arley: in working with CSBG, especially the last two or three years, because of Senator Tom Harkin and his support, and others in the Senate and people in the House, they concentrate a lot of their efforts in the Senate."
We know full well that Harkin and others in the Senate have held CSBG.
You know the
President wanted to cut it a couple years ago.
"Going forward, we know Senator Harkin was a big supporter."
"We know that he'll still be Chair of the subcommittee that he chairs, and we expect that there will be some strength there."
"The House has always been a bit more difficult to navigate, even before when David Obey was Chair, CSBG was also very well supported."
When Obey left it became a bit more trying.
Rehberg was a big supporter.
Kingston is a lot more frugal from what we can tell.
He's been a lot quicker to cut programs and cut overall federal spending.
We're beginning our meetings and our discussions with that new committee and with the new Chair as we begin to navigate the CSBG water.
It doesn't help us that the cut is coming from the administration.
"It's a very progressive, democratic administration that's saying that they want these cuts as well."
"It's an uphill battle, I will kid you not."
But we will pull out all the stops.
"Initially, I would say it's not favorable going in, but we remain optimistic at all times."
Brad:
"I don't know, I feel like my mindfulness practice brings me closer to this conversation."
"I have to teach, right."
The curriculum is not outside of this.
"There are ways that we can definitely skillfully use curriculum, the choices that we make, so that they nourish the young people."
"We don't just cover them with stuff,  this is the thing, we just deliver the lesson with this type  of languages that we have in the school."
I am just sharing here.
I think there is this moment where touching and  really looking clearly at what is there.
"And then, that also begins to tells us  what is not there."
That begins to inform our practice in terms of other ways of being that we can occupy and  what we can offer into the classroom in the midst of the essay and  the pre-writing and the brainstorming and all the things that we are doing.
"I work in an English reading  and writing classroom, so I have been looking at how mindfulness is an expression of literacy of reading."
"What do you see,  what do I see as a teacher."
Do I see just a student?
Or do I see somebody that I don't like?
"Do I see my own perceptions,  and live through those perceptions?"
What am I listening to?
What can I hear?
Do I even have the space to hear?
Maybe I feel really overwhelmed.
So I just hear the noise and I get aggravated and I lash out.
"I think, I am using my professional practice and the language around teaching or the educationist things and trying to disrupt that a little bit,  to try to wrestle it back."
Just like we are doing here.
"We are trying to reclaim walking  so that it is nourishing for us. and not just this thing that ends up  wasting our energy, aggravating it."
"So, in your classrooms, all the things that you do in your classrooms, so many tests right, just to even started in the day."
"When you get into your classroom, what are some things you can do to re-purpose, re-energize, re-use, re-strategize,  deal, adapt that moment for yourself."
"So for instance,  we just got new computers, so I have to check them everyday."
So I can make that really aggravating for myself.
"Or I can sit, get my chair and sit there and breathe and take my time, right?"
"I sweep in my classroom, this is one thing I have to do."
"But you know,do I get angry, ""The kids, they don't know the trash can"", etc."
(Laughter)
"Or I take my time, I don't have to think, right?"
Even better.
"""I think everyone at some point in their life has felt like they don't belong to something."
"They're not being set apart, they are included in what every other kid they see gets to do."""
"There are more than 80 Sparkle teams all across the country, but those are only in middle school and high school."
"Here at UW Platteville, this is the first Sparkle squad at the collegiate level."
"""It's actually really fulfilling."""
Nate Stikes is a cheerleader and a mentor for one of the Sparkles.
"He's never worked with special needs kids before, and he was nervous at first, but that feeling quickly went away."
"""There's really nothing like it"
"I just see in their eyes that this is the most fun that they've had and they love every minute of it, and that's what makes doing it worth it, is seeing the smiles on their faces."""
"""Kids with disabilities are just like everybody else, and don't be afraid of them."""
Mitch says the program has had a profound impact on her life as well.
"""The first couple practices I'll admit I left and I was just so overwhelmed, I was in tears, and now I leave and I'm just smiling."
"The joy and excitement and the pleasure they get out of this, and their parents..."
"I still tear up a little bit because it's amazing."""
This team is special because each and every member makes it sparkle.
"""To know them and meet them is to love them."
"And you meet these kids for ten minutes, you're going to fall in love with every one of them."""
Stéphane (ST):
"Juanlu, thank you for coming"
First I'd like to ask you to give a brief presentation; who you are and what you do.
Juanlu (JL):
"My name is Juan Luis Sánchez, I'm a journalist and I'm one of the people who started periodismohumano.com"
"And, well, we were in the Puerta del Sol from beginning to end"
And we try to follow what has been happening around the 15-M phenomena before it was called that.
ST:
"Yes, afterwards we will ask you in detail about the coverage you gave to that."
"The first question is ""THE question""."
"I'd like you to tell us, from your point of view, what is the 15-M movement?"
JL:
"I think the 15-M was, for many weeks, a physical space where people could share ideas, that came from a non-physical space, a virtual space, from the net, from indignation."
"And all that soon spilled out from internet onto the street, and people started talking about politics, and that it should be OK to talk about politics, and come up with a common diagnosis to society's problems."
"Global problems, not just local."
(cheers and applause) ♪♪ (music playing) ♪♪
The President:
It's nice having your own band.
"Please have a seat, everyone."
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
"Thank you, Secretary Salazar, for that introduction and for your hard work to preserve and protect our land and our water and our wildlife."
"I also want to thank Minister Rogers for the beautiful invocation, as well as Neil Mulholland and everyone at the"
National Park Foundation and the National Park Service who helped put this outstanding event together.
"I'd like to thank Carson Daly and Big Time Rush, and all of tonight's performers for joining us to kick off the holiday season here at the White House."
"For 89 years, Presidents and Americans have come together to"
light the National Christmas Tree.
And this year is a special one.
"This year, we have a brand new tree."
The last one stood here for more than 30 years -- until we lost it in a storm earlier this year.
But we all know that this tradition is much larger than any single tree.
"And tonight, once again, we gather here not simply to light some decorations, but to honor a story that lights the world."
"More than 2,000 years ago, a child was born to two faithful travelers who could find rest only in a stable, among the cattle and the sheep."
But this was not just any child.
Christ's birth made the angels rejoice and attracted shepherds and kings from afar.
He was a manifestation of God's love for us.
"And He grew up to become a leader with a servant's heart who taught us a message as simple as it is powerful: that we should love God, and love our neighbor as ourselves."
That teaching has come to encircle the globe.
It has endured for generations.
"And today, it lies at the heart of my Christian faith and that of millions of Americans."
"No matter who we are, or where we come from, or how we worship, it's a message that can unite all of us on this holiday season."
"So long as the gifts and the parties are happening, it's important for us to keep in mind the central message of this season, and keep Christ's words not only in our thoughts, but also in our deeds."
"In this season of hope, let's help those who need it most -- the homeless, the hungry, the sick and shut in."
"In this season of plenty, let's reach out to those who struggle to find work or provide for their families."
"In this season of generosity, let's give thanks and honor to our troops and our veterans, and their families who've sacrificed so much for us."
And let's welcome all those who are happily coming home.
(applause)
"For a while, we were real high alert."
We sat there in the airplanes with the...
With two of everything ready to go.
"And we put an extra 26,000 pounds of fuel onboard so we can carry like 90,000 pounds of fuel, so we can fly for a day and a half."
"Because if you found them, and you dropped the... you'd stay on station to... but it was all contingency and fortunately we never had to use it."
"They'd always come down, the Navy picked them up."
It was great.
"So, what you were doing - you'd, in the event they couldn't be picked up because of rough seas or something, you would - ?"
"No, we were there say they come down off the coast of Argentina"
"Okay someplace that they just circled the orbit or whatever and it might have happened, you know."
"So, all these orbits, you can see on the maps where they circle over Russia or over China."
"And like I said, our planes there, they didn't even hesitate, they just come right out... the capsule comes down in your territory, there'll be a C-130 within a couple hours right there and you don't touch it, you don't do anything, and you definitely don't touch the airplane coming in."
"And then if they can land, of course they would."
"Otherwise, the paramedics would jump out and do their thing."
Wouldn't need the flotation stuff but that was just a contingency because it was so primitive.
"You've seen the capsules, you know."
"If something malfunctioned, or functioned too good then they'd push those little jet streams on there and they either could go 2,000 miles one way or the other."
"So, like I said, it was a job."
And I don't know which ones I've met.
My flight orders don't show that.
"It just shows, you know..."
And it was partly to reassure them that you'd be there and the contingency that's why the astronauts flew with you
"Well, yeah, that, and just for their ideas."
Yes.
We were cargo haulers and we dropped thousands of parachute troopers.
"We dropped 80 at a time, 4 or 5 times a day."
You'd drop a couple 300 or 400 a day sometimes.
So we knew how to air drop and different ways of doing it.
"Low level, you know."
So that wasn't the deal.
The deal was you have to put these paramedics out at the capsule in the middle of the ocean and it didn't make any difference if - the army won't drop if it's over ten or twelve miles an hour wind.
We put these guys out in gale winds.
Telemachus basically undoes any doubt that we had about whether he's grown up.
"Remember at the very beginning of the, of the epic, Athena comes up to Telemachus and says basically, just come on, grow up."
"It's time for you to get going, take responsibility."
"On book eighteen he says, I used to think as a child, but not anymore."
"My heart takes note of everything, feels it too, both the good and the bad."
The boy you knew is gone.
So Telemachus is now stepping into a different stage of life.
"And he is ready to take on responsibility for, not just his own messes, but other people's messes."
"That's probably a pretty strong part of what it is to grow up, is taking on other people's messes."
"Who knows, maybe there should be a universal law built into this one."
To grow up means to take on other people's messes.
"But Telemachus is stepping up to do that and ready to, ready to do it."
Others seem to notice that this is going on.
"At the close of eighteen, he makes threats on page 389 that the suitors take seriously."
People are recognizing that he's talking more stringently.
"Page 419, we see another example of this."
"The suitors bite their lips, amazed at Telemachus stepping up and getting his, getting his more grown up person to take responsibility for what's happening around him."
Then we also see some close-up with what the suitors are all about.
We see this through Odysseus's eyes.
"We've heard from them, we've seen the misery and threats to Telemachus."
We've seen Penelope have some very small interactions with them.
But we really get to see them at work.
"See them, see the suitors being the suitors through Odysseus' eyes."
"And this starts opening up to us in this section of the, of the text through book seventeen and eighteen."
Odysseus makes his way in and makes contact and we get to see what they're
like.
"So these suitors, who are eating Odysseus out of house and home and helping themself to whatever they feel like that belongs to someone else."
"When a beggar comes in and ask them for their scraps, they turn him away similarly."
The suitor's not only abused the xenia that they expect is going to be offered them as sort of guests who horribly overstay their welcome in Odysseus' house.
"But, they've not only pervert that xenia but they also refuse to offer the xenia they should offer to the stranger that washes up into their, into their region in this courtyard of Odysseus' house."
They treated him with abuse.
They don't give him any food.
"Not turn the mindfulness  into another ought, because we can do that  if we are not careful."
"I guess I'll advice you to get support and to say that of course there is a great deal of it about, really."
There is a lot of mindfulness happening  in many ways and under many titles.
"So let's not get obsessed with any  particular approach, sect or language."
Let's reach out to people in social emotional learning.
"There are many mindfulness programs happening at the moment, very good curriculum being already developed."
"If you want to know what is around,  go on the Garrison website."
There are 37 programs to draw and  lots of fascinating stuffs around.
"I think we should really see science as an ally, not the enemy and I am sure I am preaching to the converted here."
But I think things like randomized control trials can be our friend not our enemy.
"I said that to someone  who is just being part of a group who published the randomised control trial or the .b program, and found very effective changes in terms of stress and anxiety and so on."
"Neuroscience is our friend, not our enemy."
We don't want too much 'do-wellism' here.
We don't want to start thinking  nice people teach mindfulness and nasty people teach physics and math.
(Laughter)
(Bell)
It is the same in classrooms.
"I am going to take 2 minutes  to say a couple of things, if I may."
"The final thing I'd like  to say really is to make sure that we bring mindfulness to people, not to expect people to come to it."
"And to be aware that for some people, the kind of stuff we do is very off-putting and very weird and very odd."
"We need to stop where they are, not where we'd like them to be."
"If we want to talk to teens,  for example, it may be 'singing songs about flowers' is not going down well with some tough teenagers."
(Laughter)
"Mad, dare I say."
Don't we get any more minutes  for laughter time?
No?
Okay.
(Laughter)
"Just to make sure that we express things in ways, in the language and imagery and use things like films and pop music and so on to really appeal to teens."
"Similarly, if we are talking to  administrators, let's talk where they are."
"Let's talk the language of stress  and number of days saved if people learn mindfulness, not to expect them to get into the spiritual side."
"They will get there, it is a path, we can start anywhere, as these people said."
After the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the UK government said it hoped to see Chinese people come to the 2012 Olympic Games
I wanted to go.
"People have travelled from China to London by motorcycle and car before but I thought going by rickshaw is more unique, and, of course, it's a traditional mode of transport in my country."
I really loved France.
"It had beautiful beaches, and really friendly people."
"After the Olympics is over I will go to the US by boat, travel around there, and then cycle to South America for the next Olympic games."
"Canon 6D, Nikon D600.."
We decided to make a battle between these two
"Hello, this is Digital TV and I'm Nadezhda Bakharova."
"These cameras appear to be in the same weight category, but if you like to count gramms and millimeters, you'll notice that Canon is slightly lighter and smaller."
The texture is quite similar on both of the cameras.
The bodies are made of magnesium alloy and polycarbonate.
"When you look at the basic features, Nikon makes a huge leap in front of Canon."
It's slightly faster with the burst rate of 5.5 frames per second compared to Canon's 4.5 fps ...more precise with the full-frame CMOS sensor of 24.3 MPS against Canon's 20.2 MPS... ...more accurate.
It has 39 focus points against Canon's 11... ...and Nikon's viewfinder coverage is 100% compared to Canon'ts 97%...
There's even more pros regarding Nikon - it has 2 SD card slots against 1 in the Canon 6D.
And one built-in flash against zero in the Canon 6D.
And it's a complete knockout.
"Still, Canon makes up with wider ISO range with a maximum at ISO 102400 against Nikon's ISO 25600"
"Also Canon's battery life is longer - it can take up to 1090 shots, while Nikon's battery allows it to take only 900 shots"
But the main advantages of Canon 6D are the built-in Wi-fi and GPS features
You can send photos to social networks and to print queue directly from the camera and also remotely manipulate it.
Travelers might find GPS coordinates quite useful in their journeys.
And that's how Canon can match Nikon's features.
"So, who's winning this battle - Canon or Nikon?"
You decide.
"Write your opinions below, in the comments."
See you soon!
"These cameras both come from the same family, but compared to his elder brother 6D is much more compact and weighs less."
All of the main buttons are placed on the right side of the back panel while 5D Mark ill has them near both sides of the display
There is certainly something strange happening.
"5 years ago, TED was something that was enjoyed by a 1,000 people once a year."
And the soundtrack tells us the story.
It begins with a romantic score.
"But then, as he begins to doubt and explain his reasons, the track will change."
"And we'll slip closer into that mysterium score we had, which is associated with Finn and the ghost ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I expected a different response Will."
"I thought we were both waiting for this. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I had waited, I wanted this."
"Now this what I do and say, I'm afraid. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Afraid of me?"
"A very important scene, because it's our only exposition on his past."
"And it's our first insight into his mind, that he is questioning himself."
"[music] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It was awful, Helen, I've never forgotten it."
We were run down in a fog of the coast of.
"Now, of course, the audience is meant to be paying attention to the performance and the actors and the characters and maybe not notice the sound directly."
But it's there and it's working on us.
And it's one of the ways that this film chips away at happy surfaces and shows us that underneath.
"There's despair, there is fear and death."
I mean this is a man who's already been consumed by his job who can no longer love. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; By this morning when the boy testified against me I could barely keep my seat.
[music]
"Give me a chance to get over this, this feeling that I don't know myself."
"And he's going to try to make ammends, and offer a happy future, but we know better."
"And so he can try to make a moment offer a happy future, but we know better."
"We know, I think by this point that he is beyond, beyond hope."
"Now Ghost Ship is actually more innovative by using sounds within the film world to comment on and undercut the surface story to show the dark side while the rest of the crew seems to think things are, are going well."
And I think this is mainly how Sir Lancelot works who plays Billy Radd.
He's the calypso singer.
"And watch how it works in, in this particular moment, we're going to hear that theme of blow the man down come back in."
"And its coming in, right as the radio man is talking about how he keeps his nose clean, and he is going to ignore [crosstalk] the danger's by putting on his headset."
"Life is easy for him, now we have this."
[music]
Way blow the man down.
Roll up your white canvas jib spanker and all.
Give me some time to blow the man down.
Then the breeze it blew gaily a terrible gale.
"It's actually a scene that's a simple ellipsis showing the ship traveling, right?"
Hand out of the frame!
What is this fractal snake doing here?
"Vi uses speed ramps and transitions, effects available in Adobe Premiere to produce a fluid switch between her hands and the intern's hands."
"My video includes snippets of Vi's video and  her video includes snippets of my video so our two videos are intertwined, like Escher's Drawing Hands"
"When I began watching Vi's videos, I wanted to know where Vi sets her camera and desk when shooting her doodling videos."
Alright!
So I got my tripod with my camera.
Looking at my notebook.
And I guess usually you don't know what else is on my desk.
In this case...Well there is always going to be sharpies everywhere on all sides... and possibly some snakes...
I have this pen holder for holding my sharpies...but  very quickly they end up screwing around.
My script is here for reference.
I have some lights clipped  to random things...That I may or may not use.
Sometimes I like to spin around in my chair when I am waiting
I do a lot of chair spinning...
Many of you may be wondering whether she storyboards her doodling?
No!
She just draws whatever fits her script.
"After shooting, she does a voiceover, typically at home  because it is quieter than her office."
She uses a Blue Microphone to capture the best possible sound.
"She records straight into Audacity, a free audio editor and recorder."
As you'll learn later on in this video the vlogbrothers appreciated vi's videos and as a present gave  her a mic and a higher resolution camera than the one she had been using before.
"If you look closely at my video, you can see  Vi is shooting on a Canon VlXIA HF M40."
Next Vi edits her video.
She uses Adobe Premiere on her Toshiba laptop.
She speeds up videos so you can see in just  a few minutes what takes hours to shoot.
Then she syncs it to her voiceover so that her  narration correlates to the images in the video.
Next she uploads her new creation to YouTube.
"Vi has a ""cool"" interface on YouTube because she is a partner."
"Following up on the theme of this video, recursion, Vi  and I point our cameras at each other."
"On the basis of viewers"" and fans"" comments and questions, Vi  and I decided to do a short interview."
"If you have questions about Vi's videos that aren't answered in my video, please let me know by writing a comment  below and I will answer them on a live chat, see the description below for the date and time."
"If you were to invoke the edit menu while you're on ""This Words"""
"There is an option in there that says ""replace."""
And replace essentially suggests misspellings.
But it does not do a document-wide check as you're used to with Microsoft Word or Word Perfect.
It does it on a word-by-word basis.
"Do you have a microphone or no? ...Zahir, oh, ok, good."
I want to make sure that people on the phone.. what Zahir was saying that
There is an edit mode that lets you go into a replace mode and it'll actually give you suggestions for a given misspelled word.
"But you can't do a document check for all of your errors like you can, with, you know, more sophisticated spell checkers."
I've never played with that.
"And when I get home, that's something I'm going to mess around with."
It sounds like it would be a good thing for me to know about.
[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet]
"Alright, so now ... [Apple software speaking voice]"
Someone is saying I have two spaces.
"And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's confusing."
"And this is something, it takes a little bit getting used to."
For those of you who are Windows screen reader users-- when you are move letter by letter or word by word you are always on the character that you are landing on.
"And if you type, you're always going to push that character to the right."
"So whether you're moving three words or ten letters, it doesn't matter."
Your cursor is always going to end up on the character that will be pushed to the right if you type.
"With the i devices, the difference is significant, in that, if you arrow to the left you're before the word or letter."
"If you arrow to the right, you're after the letter."
"And one of the things I keep doing now is I'm hitting the Option Right arrow-- um, and I'm thinking I'm before the word, but I'm actually ending up after the word."
"So, I'm actually finding that a little confusing myself because I've been working on a Windows PC all week and this is a little bit different for me, cuz I haven't taken notes with this maybe in a week, week and half."
"So, let me see if I can quickly get this word fixed here for you guys."
"[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet, speaking some words]"
"And what I'm showing you guys, and this is very interesting, you can tell, all the notes I take"
I email to myself.
I don't edit them on this device.
I email them to my PC.
And I edit them using Windows.
They don't take money from these various companies so you can trust that they are going to be honest in their evaluation.
So some good sites to use when you are making some purchases.
But there is information gathering.
"Phase Il, Evaluating Some of The Alternatives."
Let me tell you on page 195 there is What Kind of Spender Are You?
An excellent exercise.
So excellent I even made this a part of your assignment.
"So, when you get to your assignment and it sends you to page 195 and then it asks you to answer 1, 2 and 3, that right there at the bottom where it says 1,2 and 3 that is what I am referring to in that assignment."
Then this book is talking specifically about vehicles.
"So, when you are doing your comparison type shopping several things you need to look at when buying a vehicle."
"Now you would use similar type things on other major purchases, but look at used vehicles, new vehicles, and then also look at the other option of leasing a vehicle."
Lots of different things weigh on which one you need.
If you are on the road all the time and you put lots and lots of miles on a car it may be that you need to purchase a new vehicle.
We never purchase a new vehicle.
When you drive off the parking lot with a new vehicle the value of that vehicle goes down thousands and thousands of dollars because once you buy it it becomes a used vehicle.
"So, let someone else lose all that value on it."
"The average used car is $10,000 less than a new one."
We buy low-mileage used ones.
"Usually they are cars where either someone buys it, they don't drive it a lot."
The last one we bought was from an elderly couple.
She was actually ill and it was her car.
She never drove it.
"So I got a nice luxury car for the same thing I could have paid for an average new car, but I have a nice nice car."
If I would have bought a new car
"I would have a new car, but I wouldn't have had all the luxury."
It would have just been an average car.
"So, I prefer to buy used."
They have gotten all the lemon bugs worked out of it and we have just always found that to be a much better option for us.
Of course we drive our cars until they are worn out.
"So, you know we are not trading it in every year."
"If you like to drive a new car and you can afford to drive a new car all the time, that is wonderful."
You might look into purchasing.
This experience allows us to take the concepts we've learned and put them to work in the practical world.
At the end of the class we collaborate with Damon Lee's Film Scoring class to create a music score that fits the style and tone of our film.
This class was a great opportunity to learn the art of film-making and come out with a work of my own.

Glamour Lighting Setups
Catalogue Photo Biz Part 2
"Hey fellow photographer, how's it going?"
I'm Michael Zelbel.
Welcome to Glamour Lighting Setups.
"Even though, today's setup is actually not so glamorous after all."
We don't even have a model.
What we have is two mannequins.
And those are not even my mannequins.
"I just borrowed them from a fashion designer in the neighbourhood, who was kind enough to give them to me for a little fashion catalogue shoot, that I did for another client."
I used that last time as an example in another video of mine in which I explained to you how I think that such a catalogue shoot is so much easier for us amateurs in case we want to earn some money with photography so much easier than let's say wedding photography or let's say microstock photography.
"If you didn't watch that video please go back, watch it right now, but what you won't find in that video is explanation of the lighting setup."
"But you told me that you want to have this explanation, so today I'm doing the video with the lighting setup."
"What you want to do if you want to do such photos really really good is: you want to enable the viewer of your photos the reader of the catalogue or the user on the website wherever your photos are, you want to enable them to really feel the fabric."
You want to bring across the fabric and the three dimensionality of the garmet and what you also want is clear separation from the background.
Ideally the background is 100% white.
But be careful!
"If you too overexpose the background, then you easily get lensflare, and that really reduces the quality of the image."
So look carefully when you are shooting.
I will now show you the basic setup.
"What I used was a big white sweep, a paper backdrop, but you could also use a white wall."
Just make sure nothing in the room is really colored and could throw a color cast onto your clothes.
"And as the internet grew to encompass millions around the world, a new problem emerged."
"At the time, encryption required two parties to first share a secret random number, known as a key."
"So how could two people who have never met agree on a secret shared key without letting Eve, who's always listening, also obtain a copy?"
"In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman devised an amazing trick to do this."
"First, let's explore how this trick is done using colours."
How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret colour without Eve finding it out?
The trick is based on two facts:
"One, it's easy to mix two colours together to make a third colour, and Two, given a mixed colour it's hard to reverse it in order to find the exact original colors."
"This is the basis for a lock, easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction."
This is known as a one-way function.
Now the solution works as follows:
"First, they agreed publicly on a starting colour, say yellow."
"Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select private colours, and mixed them into the public yellow, in order to disguise their private colours."
"Now, Alice keeps her private colour, and sends her mixture to Bob, and Bob keeps his private colour, and sends his mixture to Alice."
"Now, the heart of the trick."
"Alice and Bob add their private colours to the other person's mixture, and arrived at a shared secret colour."
"Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact colour, since she needs one of their private colours to do so."
And that is the trick.
"Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction and hard in the other."
"This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic."
"For example, to find ""46 mod 12"", we could take a rope of length 46 units, and wrap it around a clock of 12 units, which is called the modulus, and where the rope ends is the solution."
"So we say ""46 mod 12"" is congruent to 10."
Easy.
"Now, to make this work, we use a prime modulus, such as 17 then we find a primitive root of 17."
"In this case, 3, which has this important property that when raised to different exponents, the solution distributes to uniformly around the clock."
3 is known as the generator.
"If we raised 3 to any exponent X, then the solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 17."
"Now, the reverse procedure is hard."
"Say given 12, find the exponent 3 needs to be raised to."
This is called the discrete logarithm problem.
And now we have our one-way function.
"Easy to perform, but hard to reverse."
"The onus is on you to educate me deeply about this thing that I'm not even interested in."" There's no way to overcome that kind of requirement, nobody can win that argument."
But it turns out that usually that reasoning is wrong.
I've heard that argument about why we shouldn't have to worry about closure.
I've heard it about why we shouldn't use recursion.
I've heard it about why punch cards are better than timesharing.
"You can go all the way back to 'it's better for us to be programming with digits, I don't understand why we need compilers'."
It's been going on from the beginning.
"That's why software development is so slow, because basically we have to wait for a generation to die off before we can get critical mass on the next good idea."
[laughter]
This is Grace again.
See the 'courtesy' badge?
I had to pay $200 to get the rights to use this picture.
"It was actually $100 but I wanted lifetime rights, so I can use it from now on."
"I'm going to use it a lot, anytime I can."
[laughter]
"I've used it twice tonight, so that's $100 per view."
"I'm getting it down, I'm getting it down."
"We've gone a long way since Grace created the discipline of software engineering, but we still have a very long way to go."
I think we're not as far along as we should be at this point.
"I think we're mainly not farther along because of that 'waa, I don't want to have to learn anything' problem."
"You are not those guys, and that's why you're here tonight to hear me rant about this."
"I appreciate that, and I think that shows a lot of value for you."
"The big surprise for me in this is we're about to take maybe the most important step we've ever taken in terms of the technology of the web, and JavaScript is leading the way."
Who would ever have imagined that?
"JavaScript is now being the technology leader, it's not just the thing that we tolerate."
Wow.
"But there we are, that's where we're going."
"Goodnight Grace, wherever you are."
"And goodnight, thank you very much."
[applause]
"I don't see very much now, I used to go quite often to see dance, and theatre shows and cinema and so on"
"I've got two small children now so I don't go and see very much but what we have seen in the last few years has really been around stuff for children that they'll enjoy free, open air things, maybe at the Southbank or something or theatre shows that are for children."
"Finally, ask the patient to swallow."
It should be done without difficulty or regurgitation.
"Cranial nerve Xl, the Spinal Accessory nerve, innervates the sternomastoid and upper trapezius muscles."
"To assess this nerve, ask the patient to shrug his shoulders upward against your hands."
"During this maneuver, evaluate the strength and contraction of the trapezius muscles."
Practitioner:
Good.
Can you turn your head to... [fades]
"Then ask the patient to turn his head to each side, against your hand."
Observe the contraction of the opposite sternomastoid muscle and note the force of movement against your hand.
"Cranial nerve XIl, the Hypoglossal nerve, mediates motor functions of the tongue, which in turn affect articulation of words."
Inspect the patient's tongue as it lies on the floor of his mouth.
Observe for fasciculations.
There should be none.
Ask the patient to stick out his tongue.
"Note any asymmetry, deviation, or atrophy."
The tongue should protrude straight out.
"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this station, we're going to practice putting a naso-gastric tube in for a feeding tube and then we're also going to practice doing a bolus feeding and a tube feeding by a pump drip, continuous feed."
So first we're going to need a feeding tube.
"We could use, this would come in a clean package and I would have opened this up, and this is the Levin tube."
"That's a long, single lumen tube and it has pre-marks on it, to help you know to make your marking, to know how far you're going to insert it."
And so I'm going to put my clean gloves on and then I would have opened up my package.
"So I'm just using clean technique, because it's going into the stomach."
So I would open up my package that has a clean tube in it.
"And I took this out and have clean, now it's clean."
"First, I need to measure how far I want to pass it."
"So I want to measure it from the tip of the bottom part of the earlobe, all right?"
"The tip to the nose, to the nares, and then I'm going to add from the nares to the stomach, the middle of the stomach."
"So I want to about that marking, that's about how far I'm going to want to pass it."
"I want to have my patient with their head slightly forward, because if their was tipped back, that would open their airway, and I want to go into the stomach."
I can lubricate the end a little with water or may get some lubrication.
"If the patient's alert, they can swallow some ice chips while I pass to help this go down the right way."
"To Karen, the only sibling who proudly wears our mom's label of a ""kraut"" just like our Dad."
How tough is my sister?
"In the past two weeks she had the entire nursing shift at the Sherman hospital taking care of my dad replaced, had a senior services cleaning lady fired and ensured one hospice nurse would never step foot in my parents house again."
Karen like my sister Theresa is a registered nurse.
"As we contemplated every angle to maintain a quality of life for our dad,"
Karen illustrated a balance of compassion and professionalism that let me nothing short of proud.
At one point in the hospital Karen paid a visit to the nursing station to rally the troops
"""I realize you're short handed, and have many other patients."" She said"
"""But selfishly the only person I need you to care about right now is my Dad."""
Trust me they understood her message
To Donna
Ding Dong Donny
At times I believe your sole mission in life is to ensure mom and dad are truly enjoying their golden years.
"You helped them to experience so many joyful times culminating perhaps, in their trip to Vail in April for the wedding between Alex - her son - and Ali."
"From baseball games, to Lake Delavan getaways, your generosity was never lost on the man you affectionately called ""Daddio."""
To our mom
An individual who has never had any issue
looking someone directly in the eyes and telling them exactly how she feels.
"We trust, when looking into Dad's eyes, those words were more often than not, endearing because until the day he died, I don't think anyone could've loved an... ...could've loved an individual more than our dad loved our mom."
Which brings us to our Dad.
I think my family is lucky because our parents did raise us to express ourselves and to not hold anything in.
"For this reason, I believe my Dad knew how important and how much he was loved by each of us."
He doesn't need to be here today to hear it.
He already knew.
"Nonetheless, those voices in my head are echoing a few final words of gratitude that I would like to share."
I'm grateful for the love of music Dad instilled in me.
"For those Sunday afternoons when he would play some Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Glen Miller, or one of his old 78 RPM records records on his stereo and often offer a subtle ""SHH SHH, just listen to that."
"Isn't it beautiful?"""
I'm grateful for the love of fishing Dad instilled in me.
"The nights before a fishing trip with my Dad were like Christmas Eve,"
I struggled to get to sleep and I woke before dawn.
"Dad convinced me we had to hit to the lake early to have any success,"
I hope you try them all and enjoy them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Hugo."
"Now, you know, what we've talked about is we've talked about the importance of mobile, and we've also talked about the mobile--the importance of the connection with the super computer."
We've not talked about much about entertainment and YouTube and so forth.
"But we, in fact, do want to talk a little bit about Google Television. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Yes, of course, we've saved the best for last."
"So with no further ado, I'd"
"like you to welcome my colleague from the Google TV team, Brittany Bohnet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BOHNET:"
Thank you.
So you would never want to buy a computer without an Internet browser.
"In these days, especially after that demo, you'd probably never want to buy a mobile phone without an Internet browser."
"Soon, you're never going to want to buy a TV without an"
Internet browser.
And I'm here today to show you a few examples of what's possible when you have an Internet browser on TV.
"First, a few notes before I get started."
I want you to understand the context here.
Google TV is launching this fall in the US only.
"And while we're very excited to bring Google TV over to places like Europe, unfortunately, we don't have anything specific to announce at this time."
So consider this a sneak preview.
"Now, I'm actually not demoing on any of the final hardware today."
You see here a dish satellite box that I'm using to control my DVR recordings in the presentation.
The box on top of it is a generic development box that we're testing the Google TV software on right now.
I'm even using a random wired keyboard that I picked up at an electronic store a few days ago.
"It has full QWERTY keyboard functionalities, a pointing device and some"
TV specific buttons.
"Now, when we come to market in the US this fall, we'll be launching with three devices from Sony and Logitech."
"Sony is launching a Google TV powered HDTV, as well as a Google TV powered Blu-ray player."
Logitech is launching a Google TV powered box that connects to the TV you already have.
"Now, both of these OEMs are going to be building incredible remote controls that you can use with the TV."
"However, you can also use your"
"Android phone or iPhone as a remote control as well, and, yes, you may be able to do some of these incredible voice commands, that Hugo just demonstrated, on your TV."
Can you imagine searching for a channel name and watching your TV tuned to the channel?
"""You have a serious hearing problem"",  she tells me."
"""You have a serious invasive problem"",  I tell her"
"""When I talk to you,  you don't listen..."""
"""When I'm focused in my work you talk to me and I don't know whether you're talking to me  or you're just talking!"""
"And then began the crossed accusations, you, you ,you."
"Now, how would it be  if instead of this accusations of speaking in second person, we could  reverse it and talk in first person?"
"This is how I see it,  maybe I am wrong but it is what I believe."
"How would it be if instead of  always trying to dominate, we could look into what is happening?"
What do you need?
What do we have to talk about?
"And, how would it be if instead  of trying to always impose ourselves, we could propose."
"Making it neither your opinion nor mine, but finding a creative way  of making it ""our"" opinion, right?"
What we're talking about is a misterious art.
The art of handling filters.
And it has at least three parts.
"The first,  is to recognise that I have my filters, it has to do with me, it is a biased sight of a much wider reallity, from where humility emerges."
"On the other hand,  recognising that you have your filters too and you also have a biased sight  of a much wider reallity and maybe even you have some information  that can be useful for me and that is where respect appears."
"And finally taking your filters and mine and construct a bigger filter,  which is more useful, more complete, more valuable."
There is where collaboration appears.
"How are our relationships seen  when they are based in values such as humility,  respect and collaboration?"
"Taking this into my example, with humility,  the matter would be of recognising that, okay, it is true that I have  an irritating capability sometimes to isolate from the exterior world, I respect the fact that it bothers you, as well as I ask you to listen  to the needs I have."
"Lets collaborate together  and find an option, when you want to tell me something,  ring the bell, text me, wait, clap your hands, or hit the cymbals."
"And tomorrow at the end  of the school day, I will willingly pick-up the kids, sit them in the park and we'll make balls of glue and we'll take them to the 24/7 guy across the peninsula of Yucatán."
(Aplause)
You ever been to Miami Beach?
Yes.
With a girl?
Yes.
Particular girl?
"Particular, yes, but she didn't carry a gun."
I've heard about those nights down there.
"They're warm, very warm."
And last but not the
"least, in order to give you the chance to get a question to Mr. Schmidt, please raise your hand."
We have ladies on each side of the stage with a microphone in their hands and we will guide the microphones to you.
"Once you have the microphone, please get up, state your name and your outlet and start shooting the question."
I think that's basically all.
The Q&amp;amp;A section will probably be limited to about 10 minutes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, so please give a warm welcome to the COO of the Messe Berlin, Dr. Christian Goke."
Welcome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Thank you, Steven."
"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon."
"Usually, when I'm standing"
"here in front of you trying to kick off the keynote, I'm either trying to present the speaker, or the company, or I'm trying to give a short summary of what have happened so far at our show."
"Today, there's obviously no need at all either to introduce the speaker or the company."
"And on the other hand, our show is running so smoothly, we are hitting new record numbers that there is time--very little time for a very brief observation."
Most of you--as you do know by now that our show started in 1924.
"1924, that was only six years after the end of the First World War; and in 1929, after some years of Europe again blossoming and a period that was later on called the Golden 20s, in 1929, the party abruptly stopped; Wall Street crashed."
"And one year later in 1930, almost to the day 80 years ago, Albert Einstein himself delivered his first keynote to our show here in Berlin; another radio talk."
"And then again only three years later in 1933, Hitler's Nazi regime came into power."
"So, what I'm going to say is, this was a very special moment in time when he delivered his first keynote here in 1930, 80 years ago."
"And what he said in essence was, ""Technology enables communication and communication enables democracy."" And I think"
that this statement is more valid today than ever before.
And it should really remind us that every new means of communication has a direct impact on our political system.
"So,"
"ladies and gentlemen, I'm reasonably sure that Albert Einstein somewhere up there is watching us and he is looking forward as much as we are to the closing keynote of IFA 2010 given by the chairman of the board and the CEO of Google."
"But before we start; film up, roll on the movie please. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, our lives are changing fast."
"Now, our lives are changing fast."
Hope that something pure can last.
Hope that something pure can
last.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
We want to have debates on these programs that really matter to people and improve their lives.
"I think you guys have a very good case to be made about the work that you do, and that's what we want to keep very focused, very positive on."
"And however the process works, if it doesn't it doesn't, but you know, the main point is keeping up what you're doing, telling the story of the good work that you're doing, to encourage support amongst those who might not be supporters currently or new members who might not know about the program and also to encourage long-standing supporters who after all are still there doing great work."
I think those are very important things for you all to be doing.
Brad:
"Well, Elyse, thank you very much for that answer, and coming to the regular order, it was very impressive work of Senators Reed and Collins in getting 34 Senators to go on the letter to the Secretary of Energy on the reallocation in FY ""13, and we're hearing fairly soon, Elyse, from DOE."
We hope to have good news to share on that.
Elyse:
I think they had a fairly short time frame of figuring these issues out.
"The fiscal year is winding down to it almost, September."
"We are hopeful that we've made a good case, and we are certainly joined by large numbers."
I think I heard there is a similar letter effort in the House.
Brad:
Yes.
"With a number of Republicans, and that's very encouraging."
Elyse:
Yes I think those kinds of efforts really help bolster our efforts here.
We'll have to see.
We want to have a robust program.
We want there to be a program in every state.
"I think that only helps us going forward, and as we fight for FY ""14 appropriations."
Brad:
"And turning to that, we have 225 people, Elyse, listening to the Webinar."
"Let's talk for a minute about the ""14 process."
"We just want to ask folks to engage on the letter that I mentioned for the reallocation for FY ""13."
So now we're turning to a situation where we will both have outside groups like
NASCSP and other stake holders submitting testimony by May 9th as we've already done in the House.
Is April 29th the Deadline?
Elyse:
"I think we've heard April 26th, and that's a Friday."
"The reason they might have chosen that day is on many subcommittees that's the last day of this work period, and the week of the 29th is a recess."
"So I think that's why many of them chose the 26th, but I should double-check my dates."
Find operation requires a little more work.
"So let's look at the Implementation, a demo of that one in operation first."
"So again we, we start out the same way but now the idea array entry really means that every one of these things is a little tree where the one node each everyone pointing to itself."
"It's the root of it's own tree so now if we have to put four and three in the same component, then all we do is we take the root, of the component containing the first item and make that a child of the root of the component, component containing the second item."
In this case we just make four as parent three.
So now three and eight.
"So again, we take the first item and make it a child of the root of the tree containing the second item."
"So now three, four, and eight are in the same component."
Six and five six goes below five.
"Nine and four, So now four is the root of the tree containing four is eight."
And the root of tree containing nine is nine.
And so we make nine a child of eight.
"Two and one, that's an easy one."
"Now if we get our, our eight and nine connected, we just checked that they have the same root and they both have the same root eight and so they're connected."
Five and four 4's root is eight.
5's root is five.
They're different.
They're not connected.
Five and zero.
Five goes to be a child of zero.
Seven and two seven goes to be a child of 2's root which is one.
Six and one.
"6's route is zero 1's its own route, so zero becomes a child of one."
Each one of these union operations just involves changing one entry in the array.
"And finally, seven and three."
"So seven's root is one, three's root is eight, one becomes a child of eight."
Okay and now we have one connected component with all the items together.
"Alright, so now let's look at the code for implementing Quick-union."
The constructor is the same as the other one.
We create the array and then set each element to be it's own root.
"Now we have a private method that implements this process of finding the root by chasing parent pointers until we get to the point where I is equal to ID of I, and if it's not equal, we just move I up one level in the tree, set I equals ID of I and return it."
"So starting at any node, you just follow ID equals ID of I until they're equal and then you're at a root and that's a private method that we can use to implement the find operation or the connected operation."
"July 23, Stiles spent the day writing diplomas onto parchment."
[laughs]
"'Yeah, I know this is a little taxing."
I've still got students and they still have to graduate so
I'm going to write out their diplomas'--which I think is really kind of striking.
Okay.
Let's turn back for a minute to look at precisely what happened as the British invaded New Haven.
"Apparently, they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of Washington's troops away from White Plains,"
"New York, where I guess they were, and that was I guess a strong position to hold, so the British thought well, if they attack the Connecticut shore, they'll entice Washington to send some of his troops to"
Connecticut and that way maybe they can defeat them on both fronts.
"And New Haven ends up being the first target in this plan, so on July 5 the British debark in New Haven Harbor."
They had about two thousand soldiers.
One part of the troops was going to enter New Haven from
East Haven and the other part was going to enter from West
Haven.
"Stiles wrote in his diary, ""Perhaps one-third of the adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to meet them."
"A quarter removed out of town doing nothing, the rest remained unmoved, partly Tories, partly timid Whigs,"" and then he adds that some of the Tories armed themselves and then went out to fight with the"
British.
"That's a great example of how our--I think our impulse is to say, 'Well, the people were united in unity against the"
British.'
"It's like--well, no."
The entire town wasn't a big lump--a big lump of rebels.
"It was people with different ideas, and you just--Stiles in that one little sentence--"
"He has people going to fight with the British, people going to fight against the British."
"He has people sort of not knowing what to do and kind of just staying in town and then people not wanting to do anything, just wanted to get themselves out of there-- all sort of happening at the same time."
"People are making decisions, some pretty dramatic decisions, and they're having to make them spur of the moment, and you can see them in a lot of cases here taking a side, taking a formal side in a way that could have pretty dire consequences."
"Yale immediately was dismissed, and some students immediately ran for home."
"Supposedly, according to a diary, one student, a sophomore, instead of going home decided to go to a nearby town and read Blackstone's"
Commentaries.
Why that made sense I don't know.
"'What, the British are coming?"
I think I'll go to Fairfield and read Blackstone now.'
Two of the victims were former members of the Auburn University football team.
Auburn police chief Tommy Dawson announced the deaths.
"""It's sickening that these young lives were cut short, and, and also the shooter is such a young man."
"As a society, we've got to learn the value of life again."
"If I could bring them back today to their parents, I would."
"Fortunately, I can't do that."
"And to the parents and families of these victims, I am very sorry."
"Please let it be known, we are grieving with you"
"In other gun violence nationwide, four people were killed in an apparent gang-related shooting in Sacramento on Sunday and four people died when a father in California's Fresno County killed his wife and two children before taking his own life"
And a group of Latin musicians has won a campaign for the Grammy Awards to reinstate the category of Best Latin jazz album following its elimination last year.
Latin jazz was among dozens of ethnic music award categories cut from the annual event by the Recording Academy in a controversial move.
"Last August, four Latin jazz artists filed a lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court claiming that the dropping of such categories had adversely affected their careers."
"The suit was dismissed in April, but after continued campaigning the Recording Academy announced the award's reinstatement on Friday."
"Hello, my name is Karen Peltz Strauss."
I grew up in NY
I have a family of three boys and one husband.
"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig."
It's only a couple dozen square miles.
It's in the Rockies.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
"My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple."
"I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question."
"And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people, for one day in their life."
The job in question: herding sheep.
Great.
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
"So, normally, I never do any research at all."
"But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals."
"So I called the Humane Society and I say, ""Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,"
"Can you tell me the deal?"""
"And they're like, ""Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."""
"They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller."
"But in fact, this man has a wonderful  relationship with the young people because he is completely comfortable with  who he is and he is completely authentic."
"And these young people  feel his authenticity and his authenticity allows them to be their true selves."""
"And that is the most important, not the differences, but the authenticity."
"(Woman in the audience) Hello,"
I work in French and American schools.
"I do intervention, teaching meditation and yoga but I usually talk to the children, not so much to the teachers or bosses of the schools."
"And basically, I am looking for help and maybe resources to know to speech, to talk to teachers of big school."
"People give you some money, basically, to come in to the school."
I am also looking for resources  to translate all the mindfulness that we learn in English in French.
(Inaudible)
(J. Bell) I wonder if anybody in the hall could answer her.
"Raise your hand  if you have some resources and then you could speak to her afterwards, okay?"
(Inaudible)
Someone back there too.
(M. Srinivasan) I also wanted to mention that collaborative academic social  emotional learning has a great resource.
"They have five competencies that  are specific taught sequentially of self awareness, self management,  social awareness, relationship skills and  helping decision making."
"If you just go to www.casel.org, there is a lot of information there including research about improved attention and focus, and students who have social  emotional learning interventions."
The latest report had an increase of 11% top points on testings.
This is all language and information that will be really effective for the administrators too.
"(K. Weare) And also to add, I actually imagine it is very typical."
"The dot-be program in the UK, if you go to it, has a paper  on the evidence based and the curriculum has been translated into French."
"I would imagine if you went  to the Garrison website and looked the various programs there, you would find quite a lot of resources."
There are 37 programs.
"If you start clicking, you will find stuff, I'm sure."
"(M. Srinivasan) Richard suggests that I spell 'casel', it is C-A-S-E-L dot org."
And they also have the evidence based  programs up there and research as well.
"(K. Weare) It is in the UK, it is called the Mindfulness in Schools Program."
There is free download of a paper only evidence-based from mindfulness in school.
"It is just called Mindfulness in Schools, if you put UK, you'll find it, and it's called .b which  is a full-stop with the small 'b'."
"It means basically stop and breathe or stop and be, that's its logo."
But I think the Garrison will also  have some evidence-based papers.
"So, there are quite a lot around  if you start google-ing."
"So what we're going to look at is a real simplification kind of taking that problem, kind of distilling it down to its essences and looking at just six operations that are kind of at the core of any text editor about moving the cursor forward and backwards with these commands."
Jumping to the front and the back of the entire buffer and then inserting and deleting in relative to the cursor within that buffer.
And we're going to do this with an extremely old school interface that's actually command base.
It's like VI comes back from the dead for those of you who have ever heard of such things as VI and E Max.
"And so we're going to look at this because there's actually a lot of ways you can approach that, that take advantage of some of the things that we've already built like the vector, and stacking queue, and the link list."
And sort of think about what kind of options play out well.
What I'm going to show you first off is just what the tool looks like so you can really feel schooled in the old way of doing things.
"So I insert the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, G into the editor."
And then I can use the command B to backup.
"I can use the command J to jump to the beginning, E to jump to the end, and so F and B,"
"B moving me backwards, F moving me forwards, and then once I'm at a place, let's say I jump to the end, I can insert Z, Z,"
"Y, X here at the beginning and it'll slide things over, and then I can delete characters shuffling things down."
So that's what we've got.
"Imagine now, it's like building"
Microsoft Word on top of this.
"There's a lot of stuff that goes, you know, between here and there. but it does give you an idea that the kind of core data requirements every word processor needs some tool like this some abstraction underneath it to manage the character data."
Okay.
Where do we start?
Where do we start?
Anyone want to propose an implementation.
What's the easiest thing to do?
[Inaudible].
In a way.
Something like that.
"You know, and if you think Array, then you should immediately think after it, no, I don't want to deal with Array, I want a vector."
I'd like a vector.
Vector please.
Right.
"So I'm going to show you what the interface looks like, here, that we have a buffer in these six operations."
"We're going to think about what the private part looks like, and we say, what about vector."
"Vector handles big, you know, chunky things indexed by slots."
That might be a good idea.
"I'm going to print out each word that's in small_words applied to ""The quick brown fox."""
I'm just sort of eyeballing it.
"""The"" and ""fox"" are at most 3 letters, so I hope to see these 2 in the answer, but ""quick"" and ""brown"" are too big to make the final cut, and that's exactly what we got out."
Recall that our goal was to enumerate all the strings in a grammar.
That was our super slow approach to check and see if HTML or JavaScript was valid.
"Well, unsurprisingly, these generators are the trick we're going to use to enumerate a lot of strings in a concise manner."
"All right, let's go through the possible answers together."
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.
"By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us, it's just the string 1368."
"But we're going to convert it to an integer using this cast or conversion here, so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368."
It's not going to be the string 1368 because we have this special conversion.
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule means that we're not going to match just one.
We match all 4 digits.
"Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368."
It's also not going to be the empty string.
"We definitely match 1368, and 1368 is a good number to match."
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.
"They featured a strong central government in China, but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty."
This is my Great Wall sketch.
"You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says ""Great Wall."""
"Cranial nerves IX and X, which are the Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerves, mediate the sensory and motor functions of the palate, pharynx, and larynx."
Practitioner:
I'd like to take a look at the back of your throat.
Can you open your mouth?
[fades]
"To test these nerves, ask the patient to say,"
"""Aaaah,"" or yawn as you observe the soft palate and the uvula."
"The soft palate should rise promptly and symmetrically, and the uvula should remain midline."
"Next, test the gag reflex, one side at a time."
"Using a tongue blade, touch one side of the pharynx, then the other."
"You should see a prompt rise of the palate, and other signs of gagging."
"And all that means is that if we see a register being reused, like over here, we have two assignments to the register X. Okay."
"We're just going to introduce another register name, for one of those assignments."
"So in this case I'm just gonna rename the first, use of X here, definition of X here to be some new register B. I'll replace the uses of that"
"X, by the name B, and now I have an equivalent piece of code that satisfies single assignment form."
"Every register is assigned at most, once."
Let's take a look at an optimization that depends on single assignment form.
"So we're going to assume the basic blocks are in single assignment form, and if they are, then we're going to know That a definition of a register is the first use of that register in th e block, And so, in particular, we're also ruling out things like this."
"So there could be something like this, where X is read."
"And then later on, X is used."
Okay.
"Sorry, X is read and then later on, X is defined."
So we're not going to allow this.
"This register here would have to be renamed to something else, say Y, And then uses of X later on here, are renamed to Y. Alright, so we're going to insist that whenever we have a definition Of a register in a basic block."
That is the first use of that register in the block.
"Alright, and if, if that's true, if we main, if we put things in that form, and that's, that's easy to do as we've seen."
"Then when two assignments have the same right hand side, they're guaranteed to compute the same value."
"So, take a look here, This example."
"So let's say we have an assignment, x=y+z."
"And then later on we have another assignment, w=y+z."
And we said that there could only be one assignment to x in any basic blocks.
"So, all of these instructions that are [inaudible] here, they can't be assigning to X. And they also can't be assigning to y and z."
Y and z already have their definitions.
"So, y and z can't be changed."
And that means that x and w here actually compute the same value.
"And so we can replace the second computation Y plus C by just the name that we already have for it X. Okay, and this saves us having to recompute values."
Alright so this is called common sub expression elimination.
Common it's a rather long name.
Sub expression.
The elimination.
"And this is another one of the, more important compiler optimizations."
This is actually something that comes up surprisingly often.
"And saves quite a bit of work if, if you perform this optimization."
We're not going to do it in the US.
It's just too--it's too creepy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
"Okay, Doctor Schmidt. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Is that where you are? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
It's me. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Oh, there you are."
Sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
Okay.
My name is Doctor Shiga.
"Actually, I just picked up the example of the cathedral."
"Actually, you know, you spoke about the organ of the cathedral."
My mother was one of those who have the chance to play this organ. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Ah, good. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I would like to say, when you come back to Berlin we will offer you a concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Oh, thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I say that because I wanted to discuss a topic, which you haven't discussed with us today, but I heard in the grapevine that there is something behind the curtain which may be of interest for us, but it's up to you to spoke about."
It's about generating and retrieving and working out proper memory.
"As you know, all this digital age we're approaching, we speak about the future."
"But I think maybe some of the most important challenges is not just hosting data, but it's not just giving us the data of our actual life, but actually hosting parts of our past."
"And I know that there are some projects in the way in the background of your big, big, big empire which are working on that."
"Maybe it's too early to speak about that, but maybe you can give us at least some ideas about these things which are less on the future which will have to do with our past and once we are done, we give you the concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
"Well first, thank you, sir for such a kind offer."
We're very interested in getting historical information into Google.
"Usually, that historical information is owned by somebody; a library, or a cathedral, or a church, or what have you, and so we have organizations that go and talk to them and try to get that information to be published."
We want to be very respectful of copyright.
We don't want to do it without their permission.
"But most people, when we talk to them, are very interested in getting their information out because it helps popularize what they're doing."
"The more information we have, the more signals, the more information that we can have that we link things together."
I don't think there's anything particularly special about music or sheet music or any of those things.
We have a number of projects around going on a pro bono basis trying to do digital images of the original vellum of recordings from hundreds of years ago.
But our real objective is just to get all the information digitized.
"April and May were bursting with flowers,"
"July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves."
"It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical."
"If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day,"
I would have thought you were crazy.
"But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet."
"And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed."
But why?
A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit.
It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago.
His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements.
"While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is."
"In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle."
"However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year."
Ah-ha!
"So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun!"
"Well, no, not so fast."
The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.
January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north.
Still not convinced?
How about this:
Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet.
"When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand."
"So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be?"
"Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up."
It actually tilts.
And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons.
The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.
"At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space."
"Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter."
"So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up."
"After the sun sets, it has time to cool down."
The new basis is orthonormal.
"Therefore, β0 is equal to v0 inner product with x. β1 is inner product of v1 with x."
"In compact form, we can write β0, β1 as a matrix vector multiplication with a matrix R, which is a rotation matrix."
"A key fact of the rotation matrix, that you can easily verify, is that R transpose times R is equal to identity."
Let's compute a square norm in the canonical basis.
"So, the square norm of x is equal to α0 squared α1 squared."
"In the rotated basis, it's equal to β0 squared plus β1 squared."
Let's verify Parseval.
"So, β0 square plus β1 square is equal to the vector β transposed times β."
This is equal to Rα transpose times Rα.
We reorder the terms.
"We find R transpose R in the middle, but this is equal to identity, so, we have α transpose time α, which, indeed, is equal to α0 squared + α1 squared, verifying Parseval's formula."
Let us now look at approximation.
The problem is the following.
"We have a vector x that belongs to a space v, and we have a subspace S, that is included in v."
"We would like to approximate x with xhat, which belongs to S."
"Of course, there are various ways to do this approximation."
"We are going to be interested in approximation that minimizes the quadratic error, meaning, the difference between x and xhat should be minimum in quadratic norm."
"If we have an orthonormal basis for S, so Sk, k going from 0 to K-1 is an orthornormal basis for S."
"Then, the orthonormal projection will simply be x hat is equal to the summation of the inner product between x and Sk times Sk."
"This orthogonal projection is the best approximation over S, in the sense of least squares."
"So, the least square approximation has properties that it will give a minimum, quadratic error norm."
"So, among all y's that belong to S, the ones that minimizes the quadratic error is x hat, and the error is orthogonal to the approximation."
"So, x minus x hat, inner product with x hat, is equal to 0."
We're going to see this graphically now.
"So, we are in R2, x is a vector in R2, the subspace s is a one dimensional subspace."
And we start exploring what would be the closest point to x belonging to s.
"So, we put circles, we let them grow."
"And as they grow, at some point they touch s, that will be our point x hat, that's given by the blue vector."
And the difference x minus x hat indeed is orthogonal to x hat.
"To make this more concrete, let us look at an example, namely, polynomial approximation."
"So, we look at the Hilbert space, PN, from -1 to 1."
For a few days at least.
"Because they're pacifists and suddenly they get hit, and they're insulted and they're treated so degradingly and so unnecessarily."
"That makes us really skeptical of the system represented by these policemen, those agents who maltreated them so incredibly."
"So I think it's not very intelligent to let the police, even though it's just a few individuals, to let them do those things."
It's not very intelligent at all.
You're turning people against you.
"Against you as a system, as a state, as whatever."
"I think it's unnecessary, absolutely unnecessary."
"And that night was very unpleasant, and it was unpleasant not to be there to see it and talk about it."
"That day I was on holiday and I didn't go to Madrid, like other times, to the demonstration."
And it was unpleasant not to be there and not to be able to inform about it.
ST:
Let's change topic to something radically different which has helped me to process my emotions.
In my experience of the 15M there's one thing that's really important: humour.
"Whether it's humour in the shape of stories like @putohelicoptero, @acampadapolicia, the posters or even my own tweets."
From time to time I had a kind of humour registry that helped me.
"I'd like you to tell me what you thought about the use of humour within the 15M, and how important it has been."
JL:
The other day I went to a bookshop and I saw on one of the shelves a book of banners from May '68.
I was confused so I took the book and I was surprised to find tweets.
"They were what I would have regarded as great sarcastic phrases for Twitter and banners, very much in line with the 15M."
But suddenly they were there.
"Obviously the cultural and terminological references are different, but there was so much creativity."
"That's for starters, because I remember seeing it the other day."
"And I've laughed so much, from the very beginning in the Puerta del Sol because there were such good phrases."
"Some were devastating, and others were very funny."
"You ended up laughing, copying them down and tweeting them, and sharing them because they're so creative, and the 15M has always considered creativity and humour way above aggresiveness and affiliation."
The richness of so many different messages.
"Some people think they're naive, and that just making jokes is a far cry from organising a revolution."
There are people who think so and say so.
People who think that in the Puerta del Sol there is no party.
"I've heard it in assemblies: ""we're not here to celebrate anything"""
"And as your velocity changes, the distance and time also change."
That's the equivalent of rotating the coordinate system.
"But there is something that doesn't change, and let me write that down."
This is usually given the Greek
letter Tau [T] squared.
And this is equal to (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)) + (Δ Z^(2)) - c^(2) (ΔT)^(2).
And this is invariant.
"This is an invariant interval, sometimes called proper distance."
"And as you change your velocity--as the space, as the mass, as the time all change--this quantity, describing the separation of two events--so, this describes the separation of two events, that quantity changes--doesn't change."
That quantity is invariant.
"Okay, so now, this answers one of the questions that was asked before."
Why does one use c^(2) or c to transform the space coordinate into the time coordinate and back?
It's because you need the c^(2) out here in order to make this invariant.
"If you're calculating the distance, if you use x^(2) plus 1/2 y^(2) or some other constant times y^(2), you're not going to get something that's invariant."
"And it's only when you use the c, here, that you end up with something that's invariant."
"And so, if you think about these as representing the four coordinates of the system, it's clear this one coordinate is x, one is y, one is z, just as you would expect."
"And then, there's this other coordinate, which is c times T, but it's negative so it has to be times the square root of -1."
"So, the four coordinates in space-time can be thought of as x, y, Z and i cT, if you want to think of it that way."
"And the time coordinate is imaginary, because when you square it, you have to end up with a negative number."
Don't worry about the details of that.
"But the presence of the c^(2) here is why you have to use c, in particular, to get from time to space and back."
And that's necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with velocity.
All right.
"So, this is actually kind of a weird expression."
"Because unlike the distance between two points--and you'll notice, these three terms put together, that's just the distance squared, ordinarily, but that is not invariant anymore, because there's this other term here, which can vary."
"Unlike the distance, this doesn't have to be positive."
You've got three different cases here.
This interval can be zero for different points.
"In ordinary distance it can only be zero if the two points are the same, but this can be zero for different points, for different events."
"It can be zero, it can be negative, and it can be positive."
"So, what does that mean?"
What happens when it's zero?

"In 1919, ""My Antonia"" had been out for a year."
And Cather was getting a lot of attention.
People loved this book.
She wrote her mother in December of 1919 and you can just feel on the page how excited she is to share with her parents how famous she's beginning to become.
MUSlC
CATHER'S VOlCE:
"In addition to painting the bathroom and doing the house work and trying to write a novel,"
"I have been becoming rather famous lately, and that is an added care."
"In other years, when I was living like a lady, with an impressive French maid, I could have been famous quite conveniently, but then I had only to receive a few high brows."
Now the man in the street seems to have got onto me and it's very inconvenient.
Reporters come running to the house all the time and keep finding me doing housework.
They demand new photographs and I have no new clothes and no time to get any.
"Yesterday, when I was washing dishes at the sink with one of Mother's long gingham aprons tied around my neck, I've never had time to shorten it,"
I heard a knock at the front door and didn't stir.
Then a knock at the kitchen door; such a dapper young man asked if Miss Cather the Author lived here that I hesitated.
"He said, ""Tell her I'm from the New York Sun and want to see her on very important business."""
I told him that miss Cather had gone to Atlantic city for a rest.
I simply couldn't live up to the part you see.
He left saying there was to be a big article about her on Sunday.
That was just the beginning for Cather.
She's still popular to this day.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he's ordered new restrictions on airstrikes targeting Taliban militants hiding in residential homes.
The directive from General John Allen prompted the Afghan government to claim the U.S.-led NATO occupation force has agreed to stop bombing residential areas and homes altogether.
"But U.S. officials say the attacks will continue but now under stricter guidelines for airstrikes, not ground operations."
"The new policy was unveiled amidst widespread anger over the latest NATO attack that killed 18 civilians, including nine children, last week."
"On Friday, Allen emt directly with some of the victims"" families and apologized to the Afghan people."
"This was a joint Afghan and U.S. force, they were taken under fire, a hand grenade was thrown, three of our people were wounded."
We called for the people who were shooting to come out and then the situation became more grave and innocent people were killed.
"On those occasions when our forces accidently kill or harm Afghan people, we are very sad."
(Applause)
"You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something."
"Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, ""I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"" they would say, ""Thank you very much, we have other things to do."""
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
"You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, ""I am this, I am that, I am that."""
No.
It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
"And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through."
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
"And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth."
"And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts."
For me it came very early.
"When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her."
"It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families."
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
"He came to talk to her and said, ""What is this about?"""
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
"Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in ""The Mahabharata"" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences."
"Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, ""Hey girl, that's it!"""
"And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,"
"""Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça?"
"Ça!"""
"And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, ""This is it!"""
"And I thought, ""This is what we need, as a language."""
We had somebody from public health.
And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
"Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year."
"And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation."
"So, what do they do?"
What about a?
"Well, this one is big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's also a, big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's a, a and all diseased."
"This one's a, a and almost all diseased."
"So clearly in this case, A, the genotype at the A marker, is more predictive of whether you have the disease, than, than the genotype at the B marker."
"So we can assume that A is probably closer to this, disease causing [inaudible]."
And we haven't said whether it's between A and B or not.
"It could be in that little area above A, as I said before."
All we can do if and this is assumption if this is a simple genetic trait that is fully explained by a single gene having a very large effect.
"What we can do is we can split this section up, this whole section over here and just infer what's going on at the disease causing mutation."
So we are saying these ones are healthy and this one is diseased.
"Or if you only get the disease when you have the mutation then this one must necessarily be little C and little C. And this one over here, must necessary be big C, little c, right?"
"Because these ones are carriers, they're healthy, these ones are diseased."
"So, let's break that up."
"Again, we have another gene causing disease, so we're just splitting this row up."
"So we're taking this original problem that we were looking at two markers and basically now looking at three, the third being what we're inferring to be happening at the disease-causing gene."
"I split this up relative to disease status, and that was it."
"So what we can do is we can split up all these other ones, like this one right here."
"These ones, necessarily are there aren't any."
These ones would be and we can continue the same process that I just did.
So I just broke up everything here.
From the previous slide into this set of individuals.
"And again, we're assuming all big C little C are healthy."
"They're carriers of the disease but they do not exhibit, actually exhibit the disease."
"And little C little C in this case are, are, are all healthy.'Kay?"
"So, without doing any math."
"Without doing any math at all, I want you to tell me the order of the genes here."
"Is the c of disease causing mutation between a and b, is it off past b, or is it off past a?"
It's very simple.
What you do in this case is you just try to figure out which one is the double recombinant.
And from that and since you know the phase you can figure out which one is in the middle.
You had to get back in touch.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Can we get back to the question?
MAN 1:
Yeah how do you see that type of thing growing up in a network connected society changing?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
It's a very good question.
"I think for a lot of people it's an entirely good thing to be able to stay in touch but there are certain people who, as you said, have always throughout history had a possibility to make a clean break and reinvent themselves."
And I head Jaron Lanier recently talk about Bob Dylan when he went from being
"Robert Zimmerman in the town in Minnesota, left, totally reinvented himself and became"
"Bob Dylan in New York City, great artist."
"You know what would happen today, if Facebook was around and there is Robert Zimmerman goofing off in Minnesota and everybody when he goes to Greenwhich Village and says your that guy, you're not Bob Dylan."
"And so for a certain segment of people, it does lock us into an identity, I think, much earlier than we're ever locked in before."
"And, for those people, which might be just, you know, the great majority of people might not mind being locked into an identity and might like having perpetual contact with their co-kindergarteners or whatever, but I think there is a segment of society which is going to find it much much tougher and these might be great artists as well, since they tend to go through this will find it much tougher to reinvent themselves."
PETER NORVlG:

"And I'm Peter Norvig, director of research."
Lets go to a question on this side.
MAN 2:
Okay I know from my personal experience that I tend to agree with you.
"My ability to read a book is diminishing every year, whereas I could read one a week, now I'm about one a year."
So I know that its happening.
One thing that I would be interested in is your feelings about the future affect of this.
I think you are underestimating the affect.
"I think that it is actually worse because we have an accelerating rate of change in society so the number of channels that we have to deal with, the number of modes of communications that we have to deal with continue to accelerate and change."
"So I'm wondering if it'll actually become a worse affect over the next 5 years, ten years and so forth?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I'm already kind of pigeonholed as a commergent, so I'm a little nervous about answering that question truthfully, but I think that's right."
I mean I think that we're facing a continuation of this trend.
"Its not a physically invariant object, Lorentz transformations change it and indeed this distance means nothing physical and reading it off the graph produces no useful information."
"So, it is not true that I can measure off distances."
"They see and on the same scale as I did over there and thus, we figure out where the t prime equal to two save point is."
"So, how do I do it?"
"Well, if I really want to plot where along the t prime axis, the point say t prime equals to one is, what I need to do is the following construction: remember there is something that is preserved in this weird and is physically meaningful in this low ends relativistic world, and that is that c^2 t^2 - x^2 is the same as c^2 sorry for the color violation here, minus x prime squared."
"And along the t prime axis well, that's the point where x prime = zero."
So
I can erase that.
"Furthermore, along the t prime axis, x = vt because this describes the motion of the left side of the ladder which is moving with speed v. So I get that c^2 - v^2."
T squared is equal to equal to c squared t prime squared.
"I am going to eventually figure out exactly the time dilation, relativistic time dilation formula which is that t prime is t times square root of one minus v squared over c squared."
What does that mean?
"That means that the time here, t prime at this point is less than one."
If I draw the point t prime equal to one.
It will be somewhere over here.
And the point t'= two is somewhere over there.
Notice that the scales of the two axis are different.
This is confusing and troubling.
"It has to do with the fact that what is physically meaningful is this Lewenstein Distant, distance if you want this sort of weird distance with the minus sign rather than the Euclidean distance that were."
Is the distance that we observe in the graph.
And you can perform with negative value for the interval a similar calculation.
And you will find that the scale of the x-axes also is extended.
And in general in any space-time diagram the scale is smallest.
And the Observers.
For the observer that is addressed.
"In other words if I draw here the lines of constant x, the constant t prime and the lines of constant x prime then I find indeed that if I drew."
"X equals one, two, three and CT is one, two, three."
"And I then want to draw the lines of x prime equal one two, three."
Then I need to draw them approximately here.
And then x prime equals three would
"lie, lay, lie way over there."
"And likewise, t prime equals to one would be way up here, and two and three and so on."
But the rest of them I just make on the fly because they usually don't have any data in them.
- Also Wonder Helper functions.
- Wonder Helper functions?
- Nice.
Just a couple of quick examples on how to write very simple formatters.
This one here just takes an NSArray and puts it with a bunch of page breaks between it.
"You can easily deal with a little WORepetition and a string, but then you've got another component with a WORepetition and String or you've got part of your component that is less reusable than it could be because it's inside of it."
"That ""return buffer.append"" in the format command is the entire implementation of the formatter, and it's not particularly difficult."
We're not going to bother parsing this so I just throw an exception.
"But, those are the only two methods you actually have to implement to make a formatter."
"If you're doing output only, it can be as simple as one line long."
A little bit more complex example.
This one here converts between separators in a string.
"I'm working on a system now as a bunch of legacy stuff, and some things are comma separated and some things are tab separated."
I use a formatter to move things back and forth.
"You can also do the same thing if you've got a string of text that somebody's typed in a text box and you want to format it out in HTML to keep the page breaks, it'll do that."
"If you've got a bunch of HTML like from an XML file or something and you want to convert it back into a paragraph, it'll do that."
"Again, there's really only two lines in it that do anything."
"The format one just does, just calls a replace along the string from the internal to the external."
The parsing just changes it backwards.
That's all you need to do.
"The only thing special, if you notice the first line in the parsed object, it was position set indexed string length."
You just have to set it to something.
"If you leave it at zero, Java will throw an exception for you."
"Just set it at something, keep Java happy."
There you go.
"Formats and parses, there's only really two lines of code."
"If you start using them, you'll find all kinds of places you can use them."
I like them a lot.
No comments?
- Position set index can be or even important if you're chaining format is to give one inside the other because you don't know where you're starting and ending in the paths for the next one.
"- Yes, but usually I try to keep them fairly simple."
Okay.
"So the war is a real presence, even on the college campus: drilling students, fighting men, guns stored in the Yale library, people having a hard time getting food and supplies."
1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year of violence in New Haven; that is the year when the
British invaded New Haven.
"And Ezra Stiles, who was President of Yale at the time, noted in his diary the events as they unfolded-- and again, it's really interesting to see his diary entries."
"He later wrote another account that had full sentences, but to me what was more interesting-- and I'll read some of them here--were some of his diary entries because they're really immediate, and he's kind of recording his reaction to events as they're happening."
"So on July 4,1779, he says he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been seen near"
"Bridgeport, and supposedly rumor said it was heading to New Haven."
"So again, being the responsible president of Yale, he asks for militia to be sent."
"In case this is actually true, they're going to need some real soldiers, but he writes in his diary:"
"""Would not believe the enemy intended landing."""
Okay.
He hears the rumor and he takes action but he actually literally cannot believe that the British are actually going to get off the ships and attack.
That can't be real; can't be really happening.
"The next day, July 5, Stiles, using a telescope, says that he ""saw the ships distinctly from the steeple of College Chapel"" and, he continues,"
"""Began to remove all property...."
Militia meeting.
Tories calm.
"With telescope from the tower or steeple clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after sunrise."""
"He sees the smaller boats going off of these ships, with soldiers, to land on the shore."
"""Immediately, I sent off College records and papers ... and a bag of my own things,"" sent his family away."
"The next day, July 6, Stiles writes:"
"""Enemy paraded."
"Sailors came on shore and took their turn at plunder."""
"I'm going to continue a couple days here and then go back to the actual invasion, just because the series of things he writes here are interesting and they become weirdly personal, which again reminds me that this is a real person's experience."
He says:
"July 7,11 o'clock p.m., ""enemy landed and burnt Fairfield."""
"July 8, ""Removing my furniture""-- (he's now moving his furniture out of Yale) --"
"""Removing my furniture broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer which I have had since 1762."""
[laughter]
"I was like: oh, okay, I feel sorry you're moving your furniture and he broke his thermometer."
"July 12, ""the whole town moving,"" and then July 23 this little, tiny reminder that Yale is still an institution that exists."
I wasn't very good at reading things.
"In fact, I don't read much of anything."
"I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do."
"But instead, I go out and I find things."
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
(Laughter)
"And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things."
"And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones."
"And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years."
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
"And so, at that time,"
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
"We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds."
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
"In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults."
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
(Laughter)
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
"And in his book, he talked about the social animals."
"And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures."
"The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of ""Jurassic Park."""
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
"You all know the story, right."
"I mean, I assume everyone here has seen ""Jurassic Park."""
"If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out."
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
(Applause)
"""Open Architecture Network"" is an amazing project that brings together the world's designers and architectures to collaborate and do stuff that anyone could not do."
It's a beautiful site that gets better every month.
"We had ""Pangea Day."""
James Nachtwey brought the story about TB.
"""The encyclopedia of Life"" has been built, that's a massive project that TED was part of."
"""Once Upon a School"", ""Next Einstein in Africa"", and this ""Charter for Compassion"". are just some of the ones that have been done."
"So, the kerfuffle was over, you know,"
"TED numbers started to grow, and it really started to feel like there was something good going on and the puzzle was, how could you get these ideas that were exciting people in the conference?"
Could you get them out into the world at large somehow?
"So, if you wind the clock back a bit to when I started the foundation that owns TED,"
I was really obsessed with this question: how do you make a difference?
How do you leverage money spent to really have maximum impact?
"And, I thought about these 5 things, all of which have massive amplification of human attention."
"And, then, it hit me that there was really a bigger thing that encompasses them all."
"And if you focused on that, you know, that might be the way to go."
"Think about ideas, you know, they start off as these little electrical patterns in someone's brain, you know, they weigh nothing. but they occur in the right circumstances, can spread to another brain, they can excite the body that houses that brain to do stuff, and if you're lucky, pass on the pattern to other people."
The ideas do the work for you.
That's a really amazing thing.
"And so we wondered how we could let the amazing ideas that happen at TED, which are after all the most infectious ideas I have ever seen, boy, if you could see those into the world, what might happen?"
And how to do it?
"I hired a woman, June Cohen to help me figure out the answer to this question."
"She is an experience media executive, long-term TEDster."
"And our first shot was television, you know, big audience."
We thought TED talks would look fantastic on TV.
"Unfortunately, all the TV executives we spoke to didn't see that."
We got nowhere.
"And so in 2006, we thought we do a little experiment, and just try putting a few of them up ourselves on the web, and see what happened."
We were worried that they would have none of emotional impact of the live event.
We were worried that TEDsters would be annoyed that stuff would be given away.
"But so, it was just an experiment."
"Majora Carter, Hans Rosling and Ken Robinson, these were three of the first ones we put up."
So in just this little sort of case study of New Haven and
"Yale, you can see how citizenship and"
"leadership came to have different meanings, how people were understanding what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in a different way as they lived the experience of fighting a Revolution."
Okay.
I ended that on time.
I even read my--I'm so impressed with myself--[laughs/laughter] the instant lecture.
Okay.
"And I ended two minutes early, so you have time to get your midterms."
"Have a wonderful spring break, and I will see you after."
"My name is Bacar Fati and I am vice president moreover, I am a founding member of the NGO Senim Mira Nassequê, and I am vice president."
"So, these people have been working from its creation for the training, information and awareness of people to abandon the pratices of... mainly female genital mutilation."
"But there is a broader activity of cutting, in the sense of putting an end to the practices especially with the NGO Saber Bom."
As we know of course that in our country there are many ethnicities that have those practices as part of their culture.
"So, in this moment we are doing a good work with the participation of other NGOs I think we are making an effort in that sense, and we are in the right way."
I am here today to take part of a training so that we can start producing and spreading our activities through blogging news.
"And today it is my second time in this activity so I think I am already learning and I have learned many things that allow us, from Senim Mira, to start spreading information about the activities we are promoting in different parts of the country."
"Right now we are in Bissau, but soon we will have another partnership indeed, the second partnership with the NGO (?) and that will help us a lot on implementing the activities in the field."
How do you show  two and three-digit numbers on a number line?
"In this lesson you will learn how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."
Let's review :
You know you can model 45 using place value tools.
If we used a place value board we know we would need four tens and five ones to show 45.
We can do the same thing with a three-digit number such as 253.
"We would need two hundreds, five tens, and three ones."
Two hundred fifty three.
A common misunderstanding when using number lines is thinking that number line models always count by or use units of one.
If we were to put fifty two on a number line...
Let's see what that looks like.
"Five tens, we know is fifty."
"And, we have two ones..."
Two jumps of... two more jumps?
"One, two."
It turned out they used it for animation.
If you wanted to move something over and over again you would do it on idle.
"It worked for that generation, but when the next generation of Macintoshes came out that were faster, suddenly all the animation went crazy and didn't work very well."
"The lesson from that was: if you don't provide a right way to do something, the street will figure out its own way."
"It turns out the browser learned from that, and so we've got set interval which was a correct response to this problem."
So HyperCard had a huge impact on the evolution of the browser.
"Basically, the Netscape 2 browser was an attempt to put HyperCard functionality into the browser."
"Not surprisingly, JavaScript is well suited to this model -- not surprisingly because JavaScript was invented specifically to do this."
"In fact, it does it really well."
"So as awful as the DOM is, JavaScript with the DOM is an effective programming environment."
You can actually get stuff done.
"If you put on top of the DOM an Ajax library -- say a good one like YUI 3- it's even better, it's way better."
One of the ways we're blessed here is that JavaScript does not have READ.
"It does not ordinarily break or halt, and that's a good thing."
"It's always been seen over its lifetime as a huge deficit -- 'JavaScript is bad because it can't READ' -- but it turns out that we're actually better off for it, because it's easier for us to think about event loops than people coming from other languages."
"It turns out you can do an event loop in any language, but we're better at it in JavaScript because we've never had this two mind thing where sometimes you block and sometimes you don't."
Being in a world where you never block just makes life easier.
"READ is bad because it blocks, and blocking is bad for event loops, and that's where we live in the browser."
JavaScript programmers are just smarter about using event
"loops than programmers in other languages, it's just a fact."
You guys are just smarter.
Event loop is just one approach to concurrency.
There are lots of others.
The most popular approach today is threading.
"Everything has trade-offs, everything has pros and cons, and these are some of the pros and cons of threading."
"First off, everybody knows what threading is, right?"
I don't have to define that?
Right.
"The first pro, and it's a huge one, is that no rethinking is necessary."
"Any time you come up with something and say 'and you don't have to rethink' it's like great, sign me up."
"I'm ready to do that, I'm ready to not have to think."
All of your bad habits work just fine under threading.
Do you have any advice following the Arab spring that just hit the middle east?
For the rest of black Africa that is still facing some sort of oppression?
"We see a year later what's happening with the Arab Spring and now in the Arab world, in Egypt we see how difficult it is to really allow freedom to take hold, but you've got to start the process."
You can't romanticize or demonize Africa.
You've got to take it for what it is and then engage the larger world and use every resource available to try to change it.
"Well, Dr. King said injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
"So he would have embraced people in the Arab Spring, he'd talk about Occupy Wall Street"
"To hammer home the point that people should not be oppressed, and that we must open the doors of opportunity for all."
His words seem to have the sort of premonition that is so poignant upon every relistening.
"Every time we hear them again, well I don't know what will happen to me now, but it really doesn't matter because I've been to the mountain top."
And you can hear the people responding.
Ha ha!
"And he said I've looked over and I've seen the promised land stretching, seeing out in a melismatic Sam Cooke like [singing] that's old school."
That's for the old people.
Don't worry.
Dr. King would have warned against the kind of vigilant hyperbole that existed in the aftermath of Barack Obama's ascent to the presidency.
From King's assassination to Barack's inauguration
"We know that the impact of King's death is monumental, opening up space for the very conception that the black man could lead this nation."
He also would've been critical of him.
That was his role.
That was his job.
"He was a prophet, not a politician."
Some people think that Barack Obama is Moses when his job description says he's pharoah.
Which means then that you're in the business of occupying political space to bring about the greatest outcome for the most citizens in your nation.
That means compromise in a way that prophets find problematic.
I think that Dr. King would have been deeply troubled by the persistence of inequality and he would've pushed rather vigorously for the relief of the most vulnerable in our society.
Neither the democrats of republicans speak about poverty.
They keep talking about the middle class like everybody middle class.
There are millions of poor people in this nation!
And Martin Luther King Jr. loved them and died with poor people!
Martin Luther King Jr. opened up this rhetorical resistance to American culture.
At its best hip hop tells the truth.
"And we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech, with a big, long pole."
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
And we were very effective.
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
Half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time.
"But it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like."
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
"One, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark."
"We also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well."
These are archival tags.
What they do is store the data.
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite.
"And sharks and fish are underwater most of the time, so this tag actually works out the locations of shark, depending on the timing and the setting of the sun, plus water temperature and depth."
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
"What happens is, you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period -- in this case, eight months -- and literally to the day, the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use."
This is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they're underwater.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.
"In that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry."
"Basically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters."
"On Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge."
"Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet with sea-surface temperature and water depth, but again, the second shark spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea."
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
Nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened.
Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
His tags didn't really work.
"All he knows is where he tagged them, and where they popped off."
"His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil."
"We thought basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in our latitudes, but in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well."
"So very simple things like that, we're trying to learn about basking sharks."
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
Although one of them has been mildly successful in early stage of Alzheimer's.
"So, clearly, Alzheimer's therapy has a very long way to go."
Next time we will continue or discussion of neurodegenerative diseases by talking about Parkinson's disease.
"Here's another nearest neighbor example, and now I'm going to ask a different question."
"Given all the black data points,"
I want to make sure that the red ones are classified as indicated and I am free to choose a different value for K.
"Say I can choose K to be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9."
Check any or all of the K values for which you believe these 3 data points are classified correctly relative to the black training data set.
"In the celebrated example of Prisoner's Dilemma, we have this general scheme where the two prisoners can either cooperate or not."
"Defect, as it's called."
"If they both cooperate, they get some payoff A."
"If they both defect, they get a different payoff D, where A is greater than D."
"However, if they miscoordinate and one of them cooperates and the other defects, then the cooperator gets the lowest possible payoff and the defector gets the largest possible payoff."
And that's true symmetrically here as well.
And this very well known example has a rather counterintuitive paradoxical properties.
Most games are not as conceptually confusing.
Here's an example that's conceptually very clear and these are games of pure competition.
"The situation here is limited to two players, where one player's payoff is exactly the compliment of another player's payoff."
"So, they always add to some constant c."
Often that constant we use is zero.
"And we call it, for that reason, zero sum games, as opposed to constant sum games."
"And since they do sum to zero or to a constant, we only need to remember one number, the pair to one of these and we can infer the payoff to the other player from that."
Here's the most simple version of it.
This is a game of matching pennies.
So you and I each need to pick heads or tail for the coin.
"If we pick the same side, either heads or tails, I win."
Which means that I get a payoff of one and you have minus one.
"If we miscoordinate, and so I pick heads and you tails or the other way around, then you win."
A very straight forward game of pure competition.
"Here's another very well known similar game with three actions from both of us and that's the game of rock, papers, and scissors, also known as rochambo."
"So, if we pick the same action then it's a draw."
And otherwise there are rules for who wins.
Go back over here to this side and I've got to make everything now consistent with what's going on there.
Okay.
"Let's start off with our constructor, which is a good place to make sure you get into a valid state."
"In this case, we're going to use the empty list so the head pointer points and tells us we have no cells whatsoever in the list."
"So we don't pre allocate anything, we don't get ready."
What's kind of nice with this linked list is to allocate on demand each individual cell that's asked to be added to the list.
The delete operation actually does show we need to do some work.
"I'm actually not going to implement it but I'm going to mention here that I would need to delete the entire list, which would involve, either iterates or recursion my way down to kind of do all the work."
And then I changed this from size to iterate.
I'd like to know if my list is empty.
"So I can just test for head is equal, equal to null."
If it's null we have no list.
Let me work on push before I work on pop.
I'll turn them around.
"The push operation is, make myself a new cell."
"All right, let's go through the steps for that."
New cell equals new cell
T. [Inaudible] the size to hold a value and an X link.
I'm going to set the new styles val to be the perimeter that came in.
"And now, I'm going to splice this guy onto the front of my list."
So the outgoing pointer I'm doing first to the new cell is allocated and
leads to what was previously the front row cell.
And then it is now updated to point to this one.
"We've got pointer wired, one value assigned, and we've got a new cell on the front."
"The inverse of that, taking something off my list, I'm going to need to kind of detach that front row cell, delete its memory, get its value, things like that."
So the error checking is still the same at the very beginning.
"Like, if I've got an empty staff I want to be sure I don't just kind of do reference no and get into some bad situations."
"So I report that error back using error, which will halt the program there."
"Otherwise, right, the element on top is the one that's in the value field of the head cell."
So knowing that head's null is a safety reference to do there.
And then I'm going to go ahead and get a hold of what that thing is and I'm going update the head to point to the cell after it.
So splicing it out and then deleting the old cell.
"Urgot's role is really, ""tanky fighter ranged carry who assassinates other carries"" and we didn't want to change that about him."
We just went too far with the last nerf on Acid Hunter.
"Cho'Gath is one of our oldest champions and he needed a tune-up, so we're making three upgrades:"
"We're quickening his cast times, fixing an issue where Rupture's delay before hitting was random, and making his Vorpal Spikes scale in size as Cho'Gath himself grows."
What do these changes mean for Cho'Gath?
"Sometimes we want to give longer cast times for gameplay reasons, like with Karthus's Requiem, but Cho'Gath is not one of those champions."
We found out that his cast times are really long so we're bringing them down to about a half second.
This is going to make Cho'Gath feel a lot better about chaining his abilities together.
"For Rupture, it was basically hitting somewhere in between .5 and .75 seconds randomly."
We fixed that bug and now Rupture's timing is consistent right in the middle of those two values.
Now Cho'Gath players can actually plan for the delay of the ability just like other skill shots in our game.
The Vorpal Spikes change really is more for fun.
"They do get bigger and hit more targets as he grows, and not with just Feast but skills like Lulu's ultimate or the Summoner Spell Surge."
This is going to make him a little bit stronger but mostly it's going to make him feel a lot better.
The Tribunal is about building a more sportsmanlike community.
"If you find hostile players in your game, remember to report them after the match."
"When a player receives enough reports, the Tribunal builds a case against him/her for community review."
"If you're level 20 or higher, head to the Tribunal to vote on cases and help shape the community for the better."
We're experimenting with new ways to reform players more effectively.
"We'll be distributing ""Reform Cards"" to players who receive punishment in the Tribunal."
Players who get punished will get a link in their email that shows them the case that the community reviewed.
This case has full chat logs and stats of the games so they can identify the behaviors they need to improve.

LYLA FlSCHER:
Hi.
Welcome to 6002x.
"I am Lyla Fischer, the head teaching assistant for 6002x."
"As you know, this course is entirely online."
"So before we start learning about circuits, let's learn about the tools that you will use to navigate through the course material."
Let's start with what is on your screen right now.
You can see that it actually doesn't technically take us to the error.
It takes us to the line after.
Sometimes these kinds of tools will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.
"So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues."
So let's go ahead and fix that one.
Okay.
"So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect parenthesis after them where the perameters are."
Even if it doesn't take any perameters it still expects parenthesis here.
Let's go ahead and add those in.
And again reload the page.
And we get to our next error.
And this one is way down on line 207.
"Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem is right here, ""this:currentTick"" should have a dot, as see down here, rather than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables."
"Okay, so now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318."
"And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we would use a colon to specify a member method."
"So, if we fix that and then reload the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left."
"And, those are the only ones that we put in."
"So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually."
"So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand."
...
"I've kept my eyes open and seen that a new time is coming and that something is happening to the people, that has never happened before."
And you see people walking around like you've never seen before.
"That's because all that was at the bottom, is now rising."
"And where there were one individual and another individual, there is now the mass, the mass- man."
"And one will stick together, and not go home to oneself any more."
"I can guarantee you that you'll get food while you're waiting, and that you'll get through this, safe and sound."
For now we are on the threshold of the land that belongs to us.
I don't fight anymore!
Take the chance!
"To the left, asshole!"
Get in behind Fatzer
Forwards!
"Alternatively if you only have one copy, we, if you're heterozygous we refer to you as a carrier."
"That means that you probably had a parent that had the disease for example, not necessarily but you probably did."
"Now let's imagine you're, you're serving a"
"lot of families and you have multiple cases of carriers, these individuals that we know are heterozygous for the disease, having kids with affected individuals."
When I say affected individuals I mean ones who actually have the disease.
"So you're crossing somebody heterozygous for the disease, the carrier, with somebody homozygous for the disease."
So this is again just like the test cross we did before.
Well lets say you have the gene attached for the parents and for the offspring.
But you don't know what the gene is causing the disease.
This is a very important point.
You do not know what or where the gene is causing the disease.
When I say you have the gene attached to the parents and offspring I mean you have their genes attached for a bunch of genetic markers.
You don't know where among those markers the disease-causing gene is.
"So let's, let's focus on two genetic markers on chromosome eleven."
"Let's say that you've already, from something else you already have some idea that, that this disease is caused by mutation on chromosome eleven."
Which actually is true by the way for sickle cell anemia.
Let's say you have two markers.
Let's say the A marker is at this point.
There's a picture of chromosome 11's chromosome Let's say the A marker is that this location.
I just made this location up.
Don't worry about that.
Let's say big A big A might be an individual's homozygous for the letter C for the nucleotides C in that position.
Big A little A has T at one copy and C at one copy.
Little A little A has T at both copies.
"This is, this is irrelevant."
I just wanted to give you some idea what I mean when I'm saying these snip markers and big A and little A. So this something just to make it more real in the context of a DNA sequence.
The important thing is that A is over here on a chromosome and B in contrast a little bit lower down on the chromosome.
So what are we trying to do?
We're trying to see is the gene causing
Sickle Cell Anemia between A and B?
Is it down below B or is it at that little area above A?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now.
This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
"And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor."
And it worked.
And it gave the studio great relief.
"After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie."
"And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us, to say the movie was a go,"
I actually threw up.
(Laughter)
"You know, this is some tough stuff."
"So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this."
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
"And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem."
(Laughter)
So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
"Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money."
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
"So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down."
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so.
"And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen."
"And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions."
"He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up."
"Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things."
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
We did about 325 shots.
"Really, it's not that I can't remember that moment. or that I don't want to speak poorly of anyone."
"One thing I do remember was calling two journalists who had been assaulted that night, and I couldn't believe what was happening."
"I said ""this is senseless""."
And I thought if it happened to me I couldn't put up with the idea of people thinking that I'd had it coming.
"You know, thinking ""he must have done something wrong""."
"I thought if it had happened to me, I'd have to do a lot of explaining about what I was doing at that moment."
"And it's a fracture, because you know people, two people who"
"I spoke to that night, and they're anything but violent [laughter]."
Anything but violent!
ST:
Violence is never a good thing.
"For me it was a kind of emotional ""deflowering""."
"I didn't know these things could happen in this country, I couldn't believe it."
"But when the press was assaulted, it was like crossing a border."
Like giving a signal.
I was really moved when I heard that story.
JL:
"I was really moved when I read you, because you explained yourself so well and although bad things happen, there are things that can't happen."
"Although that day there were a lot of things that could be criticised, though I wasn't there,"
I've read a lot of people who I trust from within the 15M movement who did things that normally aren't coherent with the 15M demonstrations.
But that's one thing and what you talked about regarding real atrocities.
"Police abuse that were later well documented, so nobody can deny it."
That also appeared in the mainstream media
"Suddenly the mainstream media were considering as true certain aspects of the police abuse that they would normally be very skeptical of, if there hadn't been documents and proof, thanks to the net, the new technologies, etc."
"Or even myself, I don't think I'm anti anything, but if I didn't know the people who were there and if I hadn't seen the videos maybe I'd have thought there had been agitators within the group."
So I don't shout out to the world that I'm a great defender of freedom for the people in the street.
"I'm saying that if it hadn't been for the internet, a lot of people, who normally got their information from normal sources, would have said ""they must have had it coming""."
And yet you talk to someone you know and you ask yourself how it could happen.
Something breaks.
You stop trusting.
"That night I thought, it's a bitter sensation,"
I thought they'd turned these two friends of mine into two anti-system people.
Susan Calvin develops the positronic brain.
She designs their three laws and their implementation.
She is very important.
She is also unattached to any mails.
"Interesting, she's a wise old woman, she's not in any way part of the Eden complex."
She's much more like the female god.
"At the end, in the evitable conflict, she confronts Steven Bierley in his office."
"And she acknowledges that the whole world wonders whether or not he, who seems to be keeping everything running so well, whether or not he is not himself a robot."
"I mean, how can you distinguish perfect robots from human beings?"
"Earlier in the novel, Susan Calvin had said the only difference between a robot and a human being is that robots are essentially decent."
"Well, Stephen Bierley doesn't answer her."
"He doesn't prove his humanity, and he doesn't prove his robot nature."
"He doesn't admit to anything he says in fact, which either a robot or a human would say, humans would not like to know that a mere man controlled everything."
"And humans would not like to know that a robot, a mere machine had taken over the government of the human population."
"And so it is better for human beings not to know whether I, Steven Barley, I am human or a robot."
We can't argue with that logic.
The last image of the story is a fireplace behind a quartz fire screen and we look in it and a flame goes out and a wisp of smoke rises.
When I first read that I thought well the whole book seemed to be working its way toward utopia.
But I know what it means for a flame to be extinguished.
"Hey when a flame goes out, you know, that's the end of insight."
That's the advent of darkness.
"This is, this is negative."
The robots have taken us over.
But it didn't fit with the rest of the book.
"Well if you read the book as a series of separate stories that just happened to be published together as an anthology, what difference does it make?"
So one of the stories doesn't actually fit thematically with the others.
"But if you read it as a composite novel, How do you make sense of that smoke?"
"So, one day I was speaking to a colleague of mine, a quite prominent our historian and as soon as she heard this she said that's the Merode Altarpiece."
The Merode alter piece?
The Merode Altarpiece is a key example of a medieval iconographic trick.
"When in the annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will bear the child of God."
"The Devine Light goes across from Gabriel as God's messenger to Mary striking sometimes in some paintings into her head, sometimes into her womb."
You know your position down.
"So, do your friends, right?"
This could be use in all sorts of very powerful ways.
"Your car, right?"
Your car should be able to drive itself.
"After all, the car knows where it is, knows where the other cars are, knows where you're going, right?"
"You can monitor in case it has a bug in it, right?"
"But aside from that, the car should take you where you want to go."
"This explosion of real-time telemetry, which is a fantastic explosion on information measured in what are called terabytes and petabytes of information, is the defining computer science data challenge."
And what's interesting about products like
"Google Maps, you saw some of this in our demo, and Google Earth is that people who love the earth--and I hope it's all of us--can love it even more."
"We can know even more about what's going on in our planet, by the way, our only planet that we care so deeply about and want to make sure it's in good shape."
You really do have all the world's information at your fingertips in any language.
There are more than 160 million uses of translate every day.
"That number is, again, growing very, very quickly."
People actually don't all speak English.
"It's always a shock to Americans, sorry."
Germans understand this very well.
It's amazing how much information there is in languages that you don't speak.
"It's true for all of us, and especially for English speakers."
We will know and we can help you figure out what to pay attention to right now.
"The explosion in user content, the explosion in real-time data, what am I thinking, what am I doing, social networks and so forth, we can help you sort that out."
We can help you figure out what is most relevant to you right now.
"Now, it's interesting, you're never lonely because your friends are always nearby, we always know where they are, they're always near you, they're always connected to you, at least in cyberspace."
"Your friends make Google in the web more powerful, they augment it, they make it special, and you're never bored, right?"
"Instead of wasting a lot of time watching television, you can waste time watching the Internet, right?"
And we have a lot more choices for you to waste your time with.
"So, not only you're never lonely, you're never bored."
"And occasionally, you might learn something in the process of being entertained, so whether it's games or movies or videos, and in the Leanback experience, we actually suggest what you should be watching because we know what you care about."
So you don't need to worry so much about what your--what are the choices.
We figure it out for you.
We're never out of ideas.
Thought it would be useful to have a problem session.
Let's see if we can work the following problem.
"So our problem says, suppose we have a source, right here."
"And just one millimeter away, we have a sink, right there."
"What is the potential that results, form this source and sink?"
"At this point up here, A."
And what is the potential that results from this source and sink at this point b.
"If you notice this diagram is not to scale, it gives you the idea that the separation along the x axis between the source and sink is small only one unit."
And both the source and sync are a long ways a way from either field point a or field point b because field point a and b are ten units away on the z axis.
"So if we take these segments, in turn we can say look this problem is done readily enough but the fact that we have a equation that gives us the potential to a source and sink combination, We compute 5p as I0 over four pi sigma R etc."
And if we specialize that to our particular situation we'd say that means that pi over A is equal to I zero over four pi sigma.
"One over R, minus one over R prime."
"If we go over to our diagram and we say, how much is r and how much is r prime?"
"Well, r is the distance to the source."
"R is the distance from field point a, where we're computing the potential, to the source."
That's distance r.
R prime is the distance from the field point A to the sink.
"Now if you look at these, this problem you would say hm."
R and R prime are just about the same.
Cuz A is a long way from the source and a
long way from the sank.
"So surely the answer here is zero, or if not zero, inconsequential."
"It seems like that would be the case, but it's just not true."
"The difference between R and R-prime may be small, but there is a difference."
"And because there's a difference, this term, one over R, minus one over R-prime is definitely not equal to zero."
"I'll write that up here, too, just for emphasis."
That term is not equal to zero.
"And as a result, when you compute phi A."
"It will have, a definite number value."
I'll leave it up to you to complete the calculation.
"If we now move on and look at the second part, the b part of the, of the problem session question, it's the same question, except it just asks for a different field point."
Now we're asking for b rather than a.
And that separation is 0.088 millimeter.
"If we make the openings much narrower, indeed, the light intensities would be more uniform, each maximum would be approximately the same strength, but then very little light will go through."
And so it's a trade-off.
"And the moment you make these two openings, these two slots,"
"larger and larger, you will understand Friday why then the light intensities are not the same, why the light intensity is a maximum at the center and then falls off near the edge."
As you see.
"It's a maximum here, and then the light intensities become smaller."
"I've shown you now the interference pattern with sound and for red laser light, but imagine now that I did the same with white light."
"The situation would be very different, and maybe even disappointing for you."
Let this be the location on the screen.
"So we -- we have X here, and here X is 0."
"And I want to know where the maxima are in the red, well that's very easy, there will be a maximum here when this position is L times lambda divided by D."
This is when Nancy is 1.
And there will also be a maximum here when we have 2L times lambda divided by D.
"And of course there will be one on this side, same distance."
"And there will be one here, this is when N is 0."
N is 1.
N is 2.
The red light will have maxima.
How about the blue light?
"The blue light will have maxima here, where L lambda divided by D, but lambda is different,"
lambda for blue light is smaller.
"Substantially smaller than red light, so the maximum of the blue will fall here, the maximum of the blue will always fall at N equals 0 together with red, and then Nancy equals 2 the blue will fall here, so this is Nancy 2, Nancy 1, Nancy 0."
"And here Nancy 0, Nancy 1, Nancy 2."
And so the red and the blue and therefore all the other colors
live a life of their own.
They don't talk to each other.
They come in with their own separation in terms of angles and in terms of locations X. That's the reason why I chose one and only one frequency with the sound.
"Because if I had exposed you to many different frequencies, many different wavelengths, then the location of silence for one wavelength is not the location of silence for the other wavelength."
And so the experiment would not have worked.
"And that's why it worked so well with the laser, the red laser, which is practically one wavelength, and so the minima and the maxima are extremely well-defined."
"If we had done the experiment with white light, it wouldn't have been so impressive, and on the next slide I show you what you w- would have seen then."
"Now in the interest of time, I'm going to leap to 1777, because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding throughout the northern states and some people then began to conclude that actually staying in New Haven and studying at Yale might be just too dangerous for Yale students-- because New Haven was an exposed port, which we're going to see in about five minutes."
It is an exposed port.
So the Yale authorities sent students out to different towns.
They didn't close Yale.
"They just said, 'Okay."
We're going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be safer than they are in New Haven.'
"So freshmen went to Farmington, sophomores and juniors went to"
"Glastonbury, and seniors went to Wethersfield."
I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like
"logical places, but you and your class were sent to a random place to continue your studies."
"On their way out, Yale officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings from troops--"
"American or British--troops, and some library books were moved inland to protect them in case troops came to New Haven."
"So again, people are feeling there's a potential real threat here."
"Yale eventually did come back into session in New Haven, not without serious problems--and again you're going to see the playing out here of something I've talked about before."
I've talked before about the problems of supplying the army.
It was hard to get food.
People weren't sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.
"Apparently, they--it was really hard for people to get food and supplies into Yale too, that people just weren't--whatever sources of supplies had been serving Yale in the past were no longer doing that in a time of war."
"So in 1778, Yale sent out the following notice to parents of"
Yale students.
"September 30,1778:"
"""The steward of Yale"
College hereby requests the Parents and Guardians of the
"Students to assist in furnishing a supply of Provisions""-- okay, 'parents, would you please send food?"
[laughs]
"We don't have a lot; we really need it'--'""without which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist the Scholars the ensuing winter."
A generous and full Price shall be allowed and paid either in
"Money, or their Son's Quarter Bills, shall be most agreeable."""
Okay.
'Please send us food.
"We don't have any, and if you do we'll either pay you or we won't charge you tuition for your son so please give us food'-- which again--Can you imagine being the parent who gets the sorry, there's no food for your son; [laughter] send some now?"
"While you're sending the homespun clothes, send the food too."
And you can just do a little Math to get to xi+1 you take.
"Xi, we don't care about the first digit anymore, so you subtract it off."
Multiply by r and then add the new digit.
That's like one step of Horner's method.
"Now, then you have to take that computation and you can do mod q all the way through."
All you have to do is pre-compute r to the n+1 mod q And so here's the computation for one example.
"If we're at this position 41592 and we know 41592 mod q we can compute 15926 mod q by subtracting off 40,000."
"The TiR-1 and that gives us just the four digits, multiply by the radix add the new trailing digit and that's the new value."
And if we just keep that all mod q then we can with just a multiply and an add at each step we can keep a running total of the Modular hash value of the five digit thing.
"So, for example, this is the case that, that we just did 4152 on 997 is, is done by ex, exactly as we said we subtract and then add and then multiply by the radix mod 997."
"So, doing those calculations all the way through the search, we eventually get to a match."
That's again remarkably small amount of code.
We're going to keep a long random prime.
Just keep it a little smaller than the biggest long value to avoid overflow.
So we pre-compute r to the m - one mod q
'cause that's the little calculation that we have to do.
We compute the hash function.
And for the pattern.
"And then, with those pre-computations, the search is extremely straight forward."
So we take our current hash value.
"And this is just, add a q make sure it's positive."
And subtract off rm times the first character in then add in the next character mod q.
And that gives us the text hash for the current position.
And then we compare to see if that's equal to the pattern hash.
Now there's this is an introduction to the idea of randomized algorithms.
There's two ways to proceed from here.
One way called Monte Carlo version.
"Where we guaratee that the algorithm is gonna be quick but with low probability, it might get the answer wrong."
In that version we don't ever bother to check whether the go through and check all digits to see if there's actually a match.
"We take queue large enough so that we're confident the probability of the, to, two digit numbers or two m digit numbers having the same hash value."
"And so low that we're not gonna worry about it, that's called the Monte Carlo version."
The Las Vegas version is guarateed to get the right answer.
"Ethnic media outlets, like Iwi radio stations."
There's 22 of those.
There's two Pacific radio stations.
"There's Māori Television now, which is having a major impact."
"Pay television, online news websites, and of course social networks,"
"like Facebook and Bebo, and a strange thing called Twitter."
Anyone in the room Twitter?
"Yeah, Twitter is now the way that most news is broken worldwide."
"The Chinese earthquake was first heard of via someone under a desk somewhere, as the building was crashing around them,"
"Twittering to their network, sort of like text messages sent out to a network."
"And it strikes me that these are things that the young people are into, and the research needs to include that."
"Now what about my friends in the news media, how have they contributed to the debate?"
"Well, very defensively."
"No primary research on the effects in New Zealand has been commissioned by the Media Freedom Committee, so far as I can see."
"They had Jim Tully do a fairly limited review, no more than a literature review, from what I could see."
"The limited examinations I've seen have really concentrated on trying to discredit overseas research used by the Ministry's consultants and researchers, a pretty big task, after what we saw today."
And the result's pretty pallid.
"Someone picked up the fact that, in a paper, a researcher had misspelled ""causal"" as ""casual"" and was hugely excited about that."
But frankly I don't see that it was a fatal blow to the credibility of the paper.
"The news media industry as a whole in this country does little, if any, primary research on anything."
They do...
"Individual media companies do a lot of commercial research on readership and sales and stuff, but you never get to see that."
"So I'm not aware that they do any research on media effects, and they're not interested."
It's too expensive.
"So if they want to challenge the Ministry's position, frankly, they need to spend some money and do some research."
"I have a little bit of a problem with researching this topic, though, because we have such a restrictive regime."
"How can we really tell what the effects are if there is no, in effect, news reporting of suicide, other than name and the fact that it was self-inflicted?"
"So I'm not quite sure how you're going to gauge that, Brian."
"I'm sure you'll explain, but it strikes me as a kind of Catch-22."
"There have been some other problems with the press, the news media's response."
"The Press Council said that something had to be done about this because of the increasing problem, especially for young people."
It's a false premise.
But if you spill it on yourself you should know that it is going to burn and it is going to be hot!
It is coffee.
As a matter of fact I bet you would be angry if your coffee wasn't hot!
"I don't know, I don't drink it."
I imagine you would be.
Haha.
"So, I am not talking about that kind of litigation, but I am talking about you deserve the product that you were promised."
And this chapter does a good job of giving you some information on that so make sure you read all about that.
"As I look at the end of the chapter, once again, make sure you go through the chapter summary."
"There are the Key Terms, make sure you understand those."
There is some self-test problems.
There are no formulas this week in here so that is good.
But the same end of chapter information as always.
"So, I hope that with major purchases in your future that this chapter has really helped you."
And I hope the next time you buy a car you will take into consideration some of the things I have shared with you and some of the things that you read in your book.
"So, happy shopping!"
Let's review a little bit of everything we learned so far and hopefully it'll make everything fit together a little bit better.
Then we'll do a bunch of calculations with real numbers and I think it'll really hit the point home.
"So, first of all if we're dealing with a-- let me actually write down, let me make some columns."
"So if we're dealing with-- let's see, we could call it the concept and then we'll call it whether we're dealing with a population or a sample."
So the first statistical concept we came up with was the notion of the mean or the central tendency and we learned of that was one way to measure the average or central tendency of a data set.
The other ways were the median and the mode.
"But the mean tends to show up a lot more, especially when we start talking about variances and, as we'll do in this video, the standard deviation."
But the mean of a population we learned-- we use the greek
letter Mu-- is equal to the sum of each of the data points in the population.
That's an i.
Let me make sure it looks like an I.
So you're going to sum up each of those data points.
You're going to start with the first one and you're going to go to the nth one.
We're assuming that there are n data points in the population.
And then you divide by the total number that you have.
"But boss, where am I gonna put all this stuff?"
"I mean, a storage room is almost full, I can't even walk in there."
"The next topic I want to address is called ""Segmentation."""
"This is the problem of given a sequence of language, figure out how to break it up into words."
"Now, in Chinese we don't have spaces between the words, and so in order to understand if the first word of this message corresponds to a single character or two characters or what, we have to be able to do the process of segmentation and figure out where they are."
"In English, we don't have that."
Words have spaces between them.
"So we don't have the segmentation problem, but we certainly have it in speech recognition in languages like English, because this speech sounds are sometimes run together without pauses in between them, and there are places where we do have a language without segmentation."
"For example, in the language of URLs you could have a URL like ""choosespain.com"", which is the travel site that tries to encourage you to choose Spain as your travel destination, but if you segment it wrong, you'd come up with ""chooses pain,"" which would not be the intended expression for that particular URL."
So segmentation is an important problem.
Let's talk about how to do it.
So welcome.
"In this next module, I'm going to be talking with Dr. Gary Friedman."
I'm thrilled to have him here today.
I've mentioned his name a few times in this course.
"He provided a number of the, examples that"
I've shared with you.
And he's been a long-time champion of good writing in the medical literature.
"So, it's great to have him here today."
"He was, he has been an editor at the American Journal of Epidemiology for over two decades, and was the Director of the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California for almost a decade, and also is on the editorial board of a number of other journals and currently a consulting professor at"
Stanford.
"So I really appreciate you being here today, Gary."
"Oh, thank you."
It's a pleasure.
"So I'm just gonna start by asking obviously, we need to do good science."
"But besides good science, what are those, some of the key elements that journal editors are looking for when they get a paper."
"Well, one is novelty."
Mm-hm.
"That's we will often reject a paper without even sending it out for peer review, if it's just a repeat of findings that are already well know."
"I mean, if you're writing the thirtieth paper on alcohol and how alcohol is related."
"It to high blood pressure, or obesity is related to mortality."
"Don't expect people to be very enthusiastic [laugh], about it."
"And so we're at a stage now, where we're running more than 20 projects, where we have humans and robots  collaborating together."
"We have the robotics systems that take the data,"
"like poor Kepler up in space, and then we have the humans down here on Earth, who are able to analyze the data."
So humans and robots are able to work together in harmony.
Except that it never works like that.
We've all seen the Sci-Fi movies.
"We all know that the robots  always go wrong in the end, and this is the vision of my nightmare."
"This is the future that we're heading towards, expect it doesn't quite look like this, it looks more like this."
"Because this particular machine that's going to run roughshod over our classifiers, is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope."
This is a telescope being built right now.
It's going to be on a mountaintop in Chile.
It's as big as the biggest telescopes in the world right now.
But it's a survey telescope.
It's going to scan the whole sky once every 3 nights.
"And it's no exaggeration to say, it's going provide a movie of the universe."
We're going to see all the asteroids whizzing around the solar system.
We're going to see all stars flickering as they have star spots.
"We're going to see the planets, we'll catch those transits."
"And we're going to see the centers of galaxies flicker, as material falls down into the black holes that lurk within their centers."
But to cope with LSST is going to be a challenge.
It's going to produce roughly 30 terabytes of reduced data each and every night.
If all we care about is things that change in the universe --
"let's simplify the problem: a conservative estimate is that we're going to have half a million alerts, every single night."
"Even if all of you, even if everyone watching, even if we all commit to doing Galaxy Zoo and its friends, we're not going to cope with this."
So we need new solutions to combine the machine with the human.
"But luckily, there are things we can do."
The first thing we can do is we can just be smarter about using people's attention.
We could pay attention to what it is that machines can do.
Maybe they can classify the routine events.
We can let them do that and we can give only those things that really need human attention to the humans.
The other thing we could do is that we can educate our volunteers.
"We can use the power of the Zooniverse, the power of citizen science to train up a generation of volunteers, so that they're able to take on the task of dealing with the truly unusual things that LSST is able to provide us."
So then let's look at the implementation side of this and I have an implementation in here I want to get rid of.
Sorry about this but I
left the old one in here.
That will do all the things that will need to get done.
Okay.
So let's deal with at the beginning.
"Starting off, right, we will set the cursor to zero."
"So that's the vector gets started, initialize empty, and nothing else I need to do with the vector."
"A character [inaudible] cursor position in that, and then moving the cursor position forward, it's mostly just doing this, right, cursor plus, plus, right."
It's just an easy index to move it down.
But
I do need to make sure that the cursor isn't already at the end.
So if the cursor is less than the size of the vector then I will let it advance.
But it never gets beyond the size itself.
So
like all of these are going to have same problems.
"Like, if I'm already at the end and somebody asks me to advance, I don't want to suddenly get my cursor in some lax stated that sort of back that."
"Similarly, on this one, if the cursor is greater than zero, all right, then we can back it up and move the cursor around."
Moving the cursor at the start is very easy.
"Moving the cursor to the end is, also, very easy, right."
We have a convention about what it is.
"And so then inserting a character is, also, pretty easy because all the hard work is done by the vector."
"When I say insert this new character at the cursor position, right, then this character advance the cursor to be kind of past it, and then deleting the character, also, pretty easy."
"Let me show you, before I go finishing the cursor, I just want to show you this little diagram of what's happening while I'm doing stuff."
So this is kind of a visualization of the things that are happening.
So this is showing the vector and its length.
And then the cursor position as we've done things.
"Inserted six characters, the cursor's currently sitting at the end, and for the length of the cursor, actually, the same value right now."
If
"I issue a back command, right, that deducts the cursor by one, it shows another one backs up by one, and then eventually the cursor gets to the position zero and subsequent backs don't do anything to it, it just kind of bounces off the edge."
"And moving forward, things are easier to deal with."
"It will advance until the gets to the length, the size of that text, and it won't go any further."
In fact there is research on CEOs.
"CEOs tend to be tall and attractive, and that's just not fair is it?"
But that's just status; that's having an effect on decisions that are made in cooperations.
Age.
Sometimes we don't look with as much respect on people who are older or younger.
We see them as immature or maybe out of date.
"And so these are some status variables that affect groups, and hopefully, that isn't going to be a factor that prevents those variables from people from contributing in an equal way."
"Now, we're going to talk about attained status next."
Ascribed status is somethings you bring into the room.
When you come into that meeting you bring it with you.
"You have your clothes on; you have your job, your economic status."
"It's all already in your past, but attained status is different."
It's something you build.
It's something you actually develop in the group itself once the meetings start.
"So we're going to call this more of a internal type of status that maybe you do some really neat things for the group, and you help them solve problem."
"Everybody's proud of you, and you're a hero in your group."
"You've done some amazing stuff, and so now you have high attained status."
"People almost want to start listening to your ideas because you were the one who worked through the last situation, successfully."
"Or maybe of low status because you had this idea, and the group went with it, and it didn't work very well."
And now we've got to go back and fix that a little bit.
"Well, you've lost some status; you're credibility is a little lower now."
"So, that's what we call attained status."
We'll be paying attention to that in this course.
The third thing we're going to look at is power.
And I think if you're in the work place you know that you have to be able to use power in a healthy way.
So we're going to talk about some of these types of power.
"And when we look at this type of power, we have things like legitimate power."
"Now, legitimate power is power that you're given by being chosen, and you actually have, you've been given the assignment to be in charge of a group."
Another one of these is what we call referent power.
"Now, I want to you to pay special attention to referent power."
Put an asterisk next to that one.
"That is actually the ideal form of power, if you can have referent power and use referent power."
Call that an understatement.
In a piece for The Washington Post
"Jamila Bey calls Limbaugh's words — ""hate speech."""
"""What Limbaugh did - and does frequently - is ""slut-shaming"" and it's no less hateful and derogatory than racial slurs."""
Democrats are calling on leaders of the GOP to condemn Limbaugh's comments.
But on MSNBC — a political science professor says she hopes they don't so voters can see what the party is actually about.
26% of voters in the election in 2008 were single women.
"So they decided the outcome of the election, and they may well do it again if Republicans keep promoting this hateful dialogue."""
But Limbaugh's point about mandating coverage is one that continues to have support within the GOP.
As Mona Charen writes for the conservative National Review.
"""Democrats come along and force insurance companies to provide for free something that 95 percent of people have been purchasing, and when we object, they scream that we want to ""send women back"""
"It's ludicrous and dishonest and manipulative."""
"House Speaker John Boehner did condemn the comments — calling them ""inappropriate."""
"And Politico reports , Friday President Obama himself called Fluke to thank her for speaking out."
This is by no means Limbaugh's first brush with controversy.
"But this time, The Atlantic Wire reports — advertisers are distancing themselves from the war of words."
"Still others note, Limbaugh's brand of runaway rhetoric can't do much to help the cause."
The Christian Science Monitor's Peter Grier asks — has he gone too far this time?
"""In pouring gasoline on a subject that was already a propane fire, he may have drawn attention to himself. but it's possible he's singeing Republicans who are standing close to the action."""
Fluke herself has responded to Limbaugh's comments — calling them outside the bounds of civil discourse.
"I was convinced as i have been told that I would be protecting civilians against armed gangs, Algerian snipers.."
"And then I saw that these people are from Yefren like us, Libyans, brothers and real men (brave)."
I appeal to stop the bloodshed in all of Libya land and I hope that will come true.
We have been told that these people are not libyans.
And that there are also Algerian snipers.We were attacked and we surrendered to them and told them we are all Libyans.
"They are not Algerians sniper, nor foreigners - only Libyans."
"We didn't find mercenaires as we had been told, only Libyans from Yefren, and frankly we found none of what we been told."
What I hope is that all this bloodshed will stop.
Let's look at some examples of gamification for social good.
"They're in four categories, health and wellness."
Energy and environment.
Education and government.
You can't say it's a bad thing.
"Even if you don't agree with the 15M, if you put someone who has nothing to do with the 15M in front of 4 people and say ""you're going to laugh"", in the end you get caught up in it, emotionally, through humour."
I think that's really important.
There are a lot of people who I believe were hooked on the 15M because it's fun.
And it has been fun.
"I don't know if it still is for everyone, but for a lot of people it has been fun. and the use of false identities, which is another debate altogether, has also contributed to get certain absurd examples of behaviour out of the furrows."
People who pretend to be someone else and talk to other Twitter users who react in a really absurd way.
So absurd it's real.
And that serves to expose certain things.
Undoubtedly it's the most original political action there is.
But it's just the beginning.
I think it's always going to be that original from now on.
"The large protests are going to be like that via the networks, with sarcasm, with a sense of humour where the individual is above political affiliation."
I think all that can be used by completely opposing ideologies.
"And we're simply at the start of a new form of political participation, to achieve the most diverse goals."
"Not just with goals that, for example 73% of the population can empathise with, but anything that goes beyong political parties and NGOs, it can be organised through the net."
ST:
Let's wrap this up.
"Out of everything that's happened, what do you think has been the most important thing?"
JL:
I think there has been a change in the mentality of society.
Vital attitude.
A door to participation in politics of the future has opened.
A way of allowing people to participate publicly from here on in.
"Not just because of the protests and the assemblies, but because of what's happening on the internet."
I think it's become obvious that a lot of people organised spontaneously and very suddenly- I mean we're organised today for this and tomorrow I don't need to know you- can impose the political agenda of a country.
Almost nothing.
"And I think it's also going to serve as an experience of political maturity for a lot of people, this has been their first political experience."
"Young people, and not so young people who have had their first political experience, and are learning a lot about this world, regarding the media, politics, team work."
Good lessons and bad lessons.
And how this atmosphere of maturity is going to evolve is quite eye-catching.
"Because if there are people who think the 15M is naive, maybe their strength is non confrontation,"
The College of Arts and Sciences attracts faculty from around America and the world.
"Individually, they bring many unique and fresh perspectives, but they all share something in common: a love for Alaska and a passion to teach and inspire."
Steven Johnson:
"You know, we get obsessed with things and we pursue them rabidly and that's a good thing when it comes to knowledge, and discovery and teaching."
"That's good, and that's what you want."
Dr. Jocelyn Krebs:
Undergraduate research is a great opportunity that students have at UAA.
"It can be very challenging to do, especially at large schools, and we create a lot of opportunities here and it's really essential for students that want to go on to medical school, go on to graduate school. and really for anyone that wants to be able to think critically about the world"
Chris Barnett:
"You know, I get to be here in the setting of Alaska and still be able to do the biomedical research"
I previously didn't think was available.
I think it's the best of both worlds for me.
Steven Johnson:
"We have grown as a university in just ways, that other, older institutions couldn't even comprehend."
We have created an environment where students can thrive.
Hillary Jochens:
The attention that I get from faculty and small class sizes and the research opportunities have been remarkable.
Steven Johnson:
The students that we are turning out are extraordinarily good students.

[Amy Goodman]
I want to go back to that moment when Mitt Romney made his entrance on Thursday night.
"He walked down the aisle of the Republican convention, and as he was passing the New York delegation, he shook the hand of the state Republican Party chair, Ed Cox, and then he shook hands with David Koch, actually put his hand on his shoulder, pointed at him, and then shook his hand."
"While [Democracy Now!] was there on the floor, we captured the handshake on video."
"The pool feed that went out, that the networks broadcast, cut away just before the handshake, showing two enthusiastic young women supporters, and then an overhead shot of the convention center."
Then the shot comes back to Romney further down the aisle. shaking hands as he ascended the stage.
And we show that split screen.
"For our radio listeners, you can go to democracynow.org."
"I think it's an interesting metaphor for the money behind the scenes, not highlighted even by the media."
Medea?
[Medea Benjamin]
"Well I think in the last--past conventions, you'd see it more overtly: they'd be giving out the bags, would have the corporate logos on them, and it would be so easy to know who is [sic] the sponsors."
The people just run the machines.
So it's much more efficient to have to do it through more machines and less through more workers in automobile production.
"So in that case you could have a steeper expansion path, where basically the marginal product of labor is falling relative to the marginal product of capital, so you want to increase the ratio of capital to labor over time."
"The bottom line is as firms produce more, they may hold constant or may change the ratio of their inputs, but they'll clearly use more inputs."
"They're going to use more inputs, but the mix of the inputs they'll use will change with their production levels."
"So the question we have to ask is, well, what's going to determine their production level?"
Where does q come from?
I'll have to leave that as a teaser for next time.
"Let me just say where q comes from, is q is going to come from market competition."
We're going to get q--
"I'm not done, I have one more thing to cover."
But we're going to get q from market competition.
Now there is one other thing I want to cover though related to costs.
"Which is an important concept that we have to have in the back of our mind, which when we come back, we think about competition."
Which is fixed versus sunk cost.
"Fixed-- my wife always thought I was saying some costs, I'm not."
I'm saying sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed even in the long-run.
"Fixed costs are costs which are fixed in the short-run, and variable in the long-run, so capital."
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed in the long-run.
"That is, they're foregone once you produce."
"The minute you produce one unit, those sunk costs are gone forever, and they cannot be changed even in the long-run."
"In other words, importantly, they cannot be changed by how much you produce."
"So in the long-run, you can change the cost of capital by building bigger or smaller plants, producing more or less."
But some costs cannot be changed.
So what's a classic example?
"Well, the classic example for example would be medical education, or any professional education."
"Once you've gone to med school and done all your grueling years of staying up all night, you've paid those costs."
"They're now paid for, and it doesn't matter if you see three patients the rest of your life or three million patients the rest of your life, you've already paid those costs."
Think of that as the capital of a doctor's office.
Workers can't just negotiate for their rights.
Striking is the best way to get their rights.
And I'll repeat again: negotiators must be elected so they don't betray the interests of the workers.
"We are 45,000 workers in the Public Transport Authority."
We have an independent union.
The independent union called us to join a strike
"The union said that workers had the right to social justice, to a minimum wage and to a decent pension."
The union said we must strike for the sake of our kids.
It's the same thing all over the world and not just in Egypt or in England.
"Ordinary people shouldn't be working to feed the rich, they should be working to feed their own families."
The rich just sit around at home getting richer.
They control the government.
"The capitalists"" control of the government is what loses workers their rights."
That is why workers all over the world must win their rights.
"I'd like to ask colleagues in London, how long before you rise up?"
You need to get the young people organised.
The time for waiting has passed.
The workers of London need to strike and fight back for their rights.
"They need to fight for the rights of pensioners, who can't win their rights themselves anymore."
"So I'm asking the workers of London, and the workers of the world to be like Che Guevara, and like Lech Walesa in Poland, to be like the workers of Egypt who changed the course of history with the revolution of 25 January and who overthrew the tyrant."
You should overthrow your tyrants in London.
"In a factory or in a public institution if there are only 5 independent worker activists but they have the confidence of their colleagues, then they can lead 5,000 others."
Each one can move a thousand.
"So I say, anywhere there are five activists like this, they can get people to move by telling them ""these are your rights and you must take them"", by showing how the rich are robbing the poor how globalisation is controlling people, and how wealth is going to a small handful, while people are dying of hunger in places like Somalia."
"I urge workers in Britain to make a revolution, because Britain is a great country."
"We love Britain because there is freedom there, and we had no freedom in Egypt."
Despite this we still had a revolution and overthrew a million policemen.
So can't you overthrow however many policemen you have?
You are the poor and yet you're working to make the rich richer.
You are the heroes of Britain.
You're the new generation of heroes
I call on the workers of London to lead the workers of the world in a revolution to overthrow tyranny in every country and get the poor their rights.
"You need the folks in DC who can advocate from their perspective here in Washington, but you also need everyone on the ground and states making phone calls and sending emails to explain what it actually means for that particular state and for communities in that particular state."
You need both.
If you only have one or the other it doesn't quite work out as well.
You really need to work in tandem.
So I appreciate all of Brad and Arley's efforts and everyone on the ground who is helping us make the case.
"Brad: our greatest Appreciation is Senator Reed because, frankly, it has been a lonely struggle these last couple of years."
I don't know if you were on the call earlier but I referred to the difficulties getting out of the gate on the recovery act issues and some of the bad publicity.
There's an amazing success story now to be told about weatherization for one million homes weatherized.
That's where the briefings held on the Hill are so important to tell that very positive story.
"Talk about things that are not frequently mentioned such as the weatherization supply chain, or in Rhode Island or virtually any other state the vendors, the contractors, the suppliers who participate, the manufacturers."
More 95% of the content of products that go into weatherization are manufactured right here in the US.
"There's a story to be told there, and it's a great privilege to work with Senator Reed and your staff in helping to increase the funding for weatherization."
Let's get this program back to the pre-recovery act level of funding so it can really deliver on its promise to help bring energy efficiency to low-income Americans.
Elyse:
"That's our goal, and again I really appreciate everything that everyone here on this call and all of your other colleagues are doing."
Brad:
"Well let us know on the letter, we will help make the maximum effort."
We will reach out to the 225 people who are listening to this right now as well as everyone in our network and work with the other stake holders.
It sounds like you're going to give us a very short turn around.
Elyse:
Unfortunately that's what it's looking like.
I do appreciate you recognizing that and still helping us nonetheless.
Brad:
"We will do it, and we appreciate, knowing how busy your schedule is, taking the time."
Elyse:
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you for inviting me, and again thank you to everyone."
"Everyone has been so helpful, and I just want to keep encouraging that."
Thank you.
Brad:
"Thank you, Elyse, and have a good rest of the afternoon."
"Ok we're going to be joined here momentarily by Steve Capanna from the White House, but I would like to turn it to my colleague, Arley Johnson"
"You could see that in the next page, figure 9-3."
Imagine that wages went up.
"So imagine now wages, instead of being $5 an hour, are $7.50 an hour."
"They pass a new minimum wage, and wages go up to $7.50 an hour."
What does that do?
"Well, that steepens the isocost."
"Your trade-off is now you're going to get fewer workers for every machine you give up, or more machines for every worker you give up."
"And so at the same isoquant, that's going to shift you to using less labor and more capital."
"By the same logic as before, you're going to use less labor and more capital, because you're going to see this shift in relative prices."
This figure shows why the minimum wage leads to unemployment.
We talked about it last time.
"We did in a graph, we just said supply and demand and showed you."
But actually this is the underlying mechanics of how minimum wage leads to unemployment.
"Because the minimum wage, by change, is relative input prices."
"If the only way you could produce things was with labor, there wouldn't be much unemployment for a minimum wage because basically you wouldn't have anything else you could do."
You'd still have to hire the workers.
"But, in fact, that's not the only way to produce things."
You can substitute to capital.
"As a minimum wage goes up, firms will substitute towards capital, and that's why the minimum wage will lead to unemployment."
So this is sort of the underlying mechanics of how that happens.
"All right, now armed with that-- so basically when we did consumer theory we were done here."
"We basically said, look, we now know you have a budget constraint, you have indifference curves, you're fine with their tangent, you're done."
"The reason firms are one step harder is you don't have a budget constraint. q is not given to you, q is ultimately decided by you."
You the firm are going to decide on little q.
"With our example for consumers, your parents gave you $96, you had no choice."
"Well here the firm isn't given little q, it's going to decide little q."
What that means is we're not done yet.
"There's one extra step we need to do with firms, which is figure out where little q comes from."
"So to do that, we're going to have to then say well, how does a firm think about the set of choices of little q?"
And how does it think about how it changes production as
little q changes?
"So to see that, go to figure 9-4a."
You don't have to conquer all these small problems that usually are associated with crops.
This had to be done with soybeans.
And these things had be done with corn.
"I mean, if you think about the effort that goes on in corn and soybeans today, in terms of the breeding effort..."
"I mean, you are looking at the breeding effort going on right here."
Win Phippen:
All right.
"Well, welcome everybody."
It's nice to finally meet Hannah.
And welcome to the mom.
"If you guys don't already know, I'm Dr. Win Phippen."
"And what we're doing today, essentially, is giving an opportunity for the interns to come back from their summer projects and sort of report back on what they did all summer long."
What they did for the money.
And tell us all about what they have learned.
And then hopefully we'll have a chance to talk to some of the advisers and the professors and giving us some feedback.
And we definitely want feedback from the students on how we can improve the program.
The grant that this is all part of is trying to create opportunities for students to get interested in the field of plant breeding.
And so we're going to be offering these internship programs for the next three years.
"And we'll have some opportunities to even create other opportunities in doing summer internships not only at Pioneer, at the University of illinois, Iowa State, and over in Peoria, but also summer work positions here on campus during the summer and during the school semester."
"So, today, really is an informal time for the student -- so don't get too nervous -- to present 15 minutes or so of what you've learned on your particular projects."
"And I think what you'll find is, you all worked in plant breeding, or in plant production areas, but you all worked on very different crops."
From chemistry to corn breeding to Hannah's variety of different things.
And then
"later on, we're going to hear from Victoria, our Iowa State person who is coming in on Amtrak, and they won't be here until 11."
"And then she is going to talk about the George Washington Carver program that she did over at Iowa State with Candice Gardner, with that plant introduction station."
"Billie, Student Intern:"
My research at the lab focused on analyzing the percent of oil and moisture and fatty acid content of pennycress.
[Text on screen:
"Billie, Student Intern, WlU School of Agriculture]"
And several studies were conducted while I was there including a position of the seed location on the plant to determine how much oil it had.
And different herbicides were used on the plants.
And a variety of trials were conducted and some other studies.
To comfort them told him this:
"""The Ministry that our Lord God will reward, isn't so much the visible fruit of Pastoral Ministry, teaching, or for evangelisation but the Messenger will be faithful to God who will be rewarded """
"The Lord God takes care of the people, because it is a sovereign God and faithful, and then takes care of his slaves."
"We're the remains clinging to the truth and walk humbly before Christ, for our financial support, the Lord God will take care."
The truth is this: the Lord is not indebted to those who serve him humbly based in truth.
God does not need anything to these people: it simply takes care of them!
Our family lived so for almost 10 years.
"Then you have nothing to fear, because since we donated to the Ministry, you can be sure that the Lord God knows that the name and honor of God are involved and will not allow its name suffers from delusions or stains."
He will worry that you have the support and care you need.
"Because God is his name and zeloso honor, so you a privilege to serve the Lord God."
"And this we already know in this life, that we receive 100 times more whatever"
"We have left behind, but the best of all this, and in the life to come, we will be with him for eternity."
"These brothers working in harsh and difficult conditions must remember what most matter: in the day when God will call us,"
What will count in the end is right if there was this sense of submission and faithfulness to the Gospel message.
"If these are true brothers and are seeking the help and God's presence in their Ministry, as well as the word says, urging and invoking (with a spirit Bereano) people to repentance, these people will be blessed, and should rejoice because it is just that what the Lord wants from them."
"Be faithful, you who serve the Lord."
"When their aim is the glory of God, the good of the Church and the salvation of sinners, this can draw various consequences: can first define the implementation of Ministry."
You can find a face with others who don't have the same motivation and can be tricky.
But we must remember that it is more important to be approved by God that by men.
It is important to be like God rather than men.
"Be faithful, and God will bless you for eternity."
Serving God is the most spectacular thing of this world.
"If your leader is God, your benefits and your retirement will be from another world!"
Worth it!

Afterwards you get to your computer at 4 or 5 in the morning and you try to be minimally creative and provide a bit of context and tell things that weren't being told in the rest of the media.
"Not regarding the focus, but rather looking for details which you think define what was happening."
"And try to write features that give people an idea of what's happening, way beyond whatever controversial incident may have happened that day."
"And then you sleep 3 hours, and then off you go again."
ST:
"Yesterday Virginia, from 20minutos, was here."
One thing that called my attention was they were always there.
It was the first media corporation that I began to recognise.
"I met Mirem, I met Marta, I saw them there..."
And it was a question of taking it easy.
Taking your time.
"It was hard to interpret, but you had to take your time."
Many media corporations didn't do that.
JL:
"It's a luxury, isn't it."
We allowed ourselves the luxury of spending hours in a square informing about that was happening.
It's hard for that to happen in a media corporation.
Very complicated.
We were born to do that.
We were born out of this journalistic crisis and we decided to slow down and inform with a bit of good sense.
"And we did that, and we created Periodismo Humano."
"But there's a lot of merit in other manstream media corporations which we are very critical of, but we have to acknowledge that there are some media corporations, especially some journalists who in their free time, went to the square because they decided they didn't need permission from their boss, their corporation or their structure, they went there because they wanted to be journalists for this kind of thing."
"The rest of the year they're bored, and when something interesting like this happens, and things are going on, they want to be there in the square."
If I hadn't been working in Periodismo Humano I would have spent my free time there.
And I'd have done the same job through my personal blog.
"I'm sure of that. fortunately there was a structure and co-workers who as a group made everything so much more valid, more visible, and richer."
But I'm sure that any of the journalists there would have done exactly the same thing.
"Because you become a journalist for things like this, and if they happen and you don't experience them, why bother?"
ST:
"To finish with the topic of journalism, I'd like you to tell me what the relationship with the people who gave you your information was like."
"Because the beginning was complicated, that first week."
But I get the impression that the management of that information was very efficient.
So they're really critical for a Greywater System.
And you don't actually have to do anything; you just need to have healthy soil.
And I just want to show you my favorite one.
"This is, you know, sort of not an exactly realistic picture."
So microscopic organism; this one is called the Tardigrade.
Any of you heard of the Tardigrade?
"Now, this little bitty microscopic organism went into space and it survived space and it formed, turns itself into a cyst and can survive pretty much anything."
It came back to earth and reproduced.
"So these things are--you know, in the soil, there's really strong organisms that can do just about anything like survive space."
"So we don't--if we get our Greywater going into healthy soil, we don't have to worry so much about the nutrients in it and the gunky stuff. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thanks.
"So, the Tardigrades are going to save us."
"Okay, we're going to take a little bit of a deeper dive now and focus on one particular system, the laundry to landscape system."
And I think the value of taking a focus on this one is this is considered like the low-hanging fruit of Greywater Systems.
It's a great place to start.
And I'll just run you through at a very high level here how it's done.
"Firstly, obviously, as Laura had mentioned, we have to be careful about what detergents or soaps we use in the first place."
We have to use non-toxic ingredients.
"And then we can re-use that water that's coming out of the washing machine, divert it--and"
I'll show you some parts here in a minute--out to the landscape and grow food with it or shelter or a beautiful backyard oasis.
"Really, whatever we desire in terms of our backyard spaces or front yard landscapes, for that matter."
"Here's a little deeper dive; oops, excuse me."
This is a schematic of a laundry to landscape system.
It shows you how the plan would work in effect.
"Obviously, it's showing the collection plumbing here that distributes out to the landscape--thank you--out to the landscape and actually, emits the water directly into the soil."
And that connects with the mulch basins that we just heard Laura talk to.
"So, the beauty of this system is that, well, for one, it has a built-in pump."
It uses the pump of the washing machine.
"So if there are any distributions challenges, maybe you have a slight incline."
There are some ways to overcome those challenges because you have this built-in pump.
"Apart from that, no additional gadgetry is required."
"No filters to break down, which is wonderful."
So the buildings will vary depending on the interests of the occupant.
"Other than that, there would be a very wide selection of what buildings people can live in."
"All the lines are curved, which makes the building much stronger."
And the boats and helicopter is there for your use.
In the future i don't think people will want to own anything anymore.
Everything is there for their use.
But you don't own anything.
You live in a building as long as you like.
You can travel any place you want to travel.
"And then if you come over here, this may be a model of an art center in the future, where artist materials, you have access to any material you want."
There is no fee anymore.
And so what you see here is different buildings and different mechanisms that serve a different purpose.
This represents a joint venture of all the world's people going out into space together and using it for the benefit of everyone.
"Now, if you come over here, you will see these are exhibition buildings."
Some of them we built for China originally.
And this represents a rooftop landing area.
And the rooftop gardens will be on all buildings in the future.
All of the larger buildings will have a rooftop gardens or solar generators as part of the roof.
"Jacque Fresco sees all repetitive tasks being performed by automated machinery in the future, enabling people to have more free time to explore their areas of interest and help advance society."
This is a way we produce buildings in the future.
This is a machine that has a die placed in this area and then it squeezes the buildings out like that.
And then a laser beam cuts them.
And this machine picks the building off and transfers it to this machine.
"And this machine, if i can change my position, if you can see this, this machine shoves the building onto that ramp."
It shoves on like that.
"And once it gets there, the memory metals lock and keep it in place."
"The buildings will be put up in dry dock, that means like ships are built."
Then a machine that looks like this will travel along putting in the windows and everything.
"And then when the buildings are finished, say you have got like 10 buildings finished in here, then we flood it with water and the buildings are built on a float, and we float the building to the location."
Then we use water jets under the building.
So we slip the building in place like that.
"Instead of bringing building material out there and cut it up and make it, we make them all in dry dock and we move them on water, because with water you can move heavy freight and it doesn't have to be fast."
My pleasure.
"And I apologize for calling in a few minutes late, and I apologize to the speaker who I interrupted as a result."
"From what I caught at the very end it seemed interesting, so I'll let you all get back to that."
Brad:
We'll get right back to that.
"Thank you, Steve, and have a good rest of the day."
Steve: you too.
Thanks Brad.
Brad: before returning to Mark Schmeissing I just want to take care of a couple housekeeping matters.
I understand from questions that have come in that some folks in the audience have had difficulties with the audio portion.
"And some folks have been saying, ""When will the recorded webinar be made available?"" Before we go off the air here today and we complete the discussion of CSBG we will tell our"
listeners when the recorded webinar will be available.
"Someone else also wrote in, Mr. Todd Richardson, for the lobbying and advocacy work that we're going to be doing for the member request letters that"
"Senator Reed's legislative director referred to earlier, will we be sending out talking points for those of us making the calls?"
Answer:
"Yes, definitely, Todd, we will be doing that."
As soon as we get the letters from Senators Reed and Collins we will be sending those talking points out to everybody who is on this webinar and everyone who is part of our network.
"So we will be coming back to more questions that have come in, but what I'd like to do at this point, just to alert Mark Schmeissing, you do have a number of questions, Mark."
"So let's come back and complete your regular presentation, and then let's get right into the questions for the remaining 30 minutes of this webinar."
Mark:
That sounds great.
Thanks Brad.
So I'm just going to finish up with the overview of ROMA Next
Generation Grant.
We've talked through what we are doing in that process.
"If we go to the next slide, you'll see a diagram developed by the urban institute."
This figure is supposed to show how the three different training and technical assistance efforts are fitting together.
"In the center you'll see those core organizational standards that mainly speak to organizational capacity (things like leadership and governance and community engagement, human resource management, financial operations)."
Those are the things that are being developed through the Organizational Standards Center of Excellence.
Around that you'll see ROMA 2.0 which is another way that the ROMA Next Generation Center of
Excellence is referred to.
That ROMA cycle is the ongoing community action system that's framing our specific and special mandates to address the causes and traditions of poverty.
"For example, if I pick rock and you paper then you win."
I picked rock and you scissors then I win.
And so on.
"Again, the payoffs in both cases sum to zero."
"This parenthetically, this very simple children game actually has an annual competition that carries a nontrivial prize of $10,000 and it's actually a sobering thought that when we look at this trivial game then, perhaps, chuckle a little bit, if we actually participated in this competition we'd actually think hard about how to play it."
"Here's the other extreme, of games of pure coordination or pure cooperation."
"In this case, all agents have exactly the same interest."
"In other words, the payoffs for every action vector that they take is the same."
And so the utility for player 'i' is always the same as the utility for player 'j' for every action vector that they choose.
"And so again we here, too, will need to write each cell of matrix only one number because it's common to all the players."
"It's drives home that perhaps the unfortunate term ""noncooperate"" game theory that describes this dominant strand of game theory that we are discussing for now"
"It's, the name was suggested these are games for, that descibe situations that are inherently conflictual but as we see they apply also to games in which the interests of the players coincide."
So here's a game that describes the purely cooperative situation.
You and I walk towards each other on the sidewalk.
We can each decide whether to go to our respective left or respective right.
And if we pick the same side then all is good.
We avoid a collision.
"If we don't, then we do collide and that's equally bad for both of us."
"Of course in general, games will be neither purelly cooperative nor purely conflictual and here's a game that exemplifies that."
"This is a game that's called ""Battle of the Sexes."""
So imagine a husband and a wife who want to go out to a movie.
There are two movies that they can choose from.
"Let's say ""Battle of Armageddon"" and ""Flower Child."""
"The one, a violent war movie, and the other is a romantic comedy."
Above all they want to go together to the movie.
If they go to different movies then they are equally unhappy.
So they want to go to the same movie but they have conflicting preferences.
"The wife clearly would prefer to go to ""Battle of Armageddon"" and the husband, as romantic as he is, would like to go to ""Flower Child."""
"So, both cooperation and competition in this game."
"İyi ki doğdun, Fatmagül."
"[Glad that you were born, Fatmagül.]"
"Happy birthday, halacığım."
I guess we haven't done enough generally to allow different ways for people to be able to participate.
Natalie:
"And right now the roles in the community, theres not that many, theres some different ones but its a small subset so we're trying to think how can there be more roles or people can opt in to taking on more of a role."
Because we do see that in these after school programs and also in the online community.
That can be really motivating and helping people develop and want to actually have an authentic role.
Avi:
"I think part of that and it relates to questions that people asked, so how do you work to promote motivation in really constrained environments where for example teachers have to teach for the standardized test or with a very closed curriculum."
And I think that the idea again is 1.
There are no recipes but the principles are the same.
So what you do is you analyze and its all working with tensions.
And the idea is you analyze the tensions in your particular environment with your particular people.
Who are the people around here?
What are their complex motivations?
"The more you know about your context and your constraints, the better you will be able to say how can I apply the principles of motivation in this particular context and then you apply it and then you study it again."
And you see what the effect you had and you read redesign and its an iterative process in a complex environment with a complex process that is unpredicatable really.
"But you can actually, using the principles you can anticipate they will move a particular direction."
Natalie:
"Yes, that great."
Fred Bartels has an example.
Some other people have talked about how they've done some compromises between these two things based on their environment and like you said iterate it.
So its great to look back at that.
Mitch:
"So I think we need to wrap up now, at least for me , the hour flew past."
There were lots of really interesting topics and ideas that came up so maybe just I'll say a few words now about
looking ahead.
"But first of all, I really want to thank Avi for joining us and participating."
It was great to hear your points of view on these ideas and I think it will stir up lots of continuing conversations about these ideas.
Avi:
My pleasure.
Mitch:
"Looking ahead, actually we aren't going to be meeting for the next two weeks because there are various events here at MlT."
"Actually theres a Massachusetts holiday next week, Patriot's Day when the Boston Marathon is run so we won't be holding class next Monday."
Sal thank you very much from the Khan Academy.
Sal:
Thank you.
Tom:
And you and I will get together later and see if we can improve my math skills.
Thank you.
This is a Web Archiving Service tutorial video that will show you how to conduct an XML metadata export.
There are two different options for exporting as an XML file.
The first method can provide you with the document of all of your files.
"To complete an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Project Admin"" page, which is found under the ""Administration"" tab."
"Here you find a link to the XML metadata export page, in the list of reports."
"Once you are on the XML Metadata Export page, you may choose whether you would like to export all of your files, or just your publicly available files."
"Click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
The second option for exporting as an XML file allows you to create a limited list of files for export.
"To create an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Manage Sites"" page, which is found under the ""Sites"" tab."
"Once you are on the ""Manage Sites"" page, you can use the limits on the right side of the screen to narrow the results that are displayed."
"For example, you might choose to only display items that have been captured since a particular date."
"After creating a limited list, select the items that you are interested in exporting, and then scroll to the bottom of the page."
"Click on the link that says ""Get XML Metadata Export for selected."""
This link takes you to the same
"""XML Metadata Export"" page where you were able to choose whether you would like to include all of the items you selected, or just the publicly available ones."
"Again, click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
"Choosing between these two XML Metadata options is dependent on whether you are interested in creating a brand-new list, or whether you are updating a previously created list."
The document created from the XML Metadata Export is a raw XML file.
You will need to convert the file to make it functional in your local system.
Feel free to use your local tools for this.
WAS provides a generic MarcEdit XSL stylesheet that can be installed to produce basic MARC records from the XML report.
You will still need to customize the XSL stylesheet to fit the needs of your institution.
"Further information can be found by clicking on the ""Help"" link and choosing ""XML Site Report."""
"This document provides a description of all of the fields in the XML report, as well as a link to the previously mentioned"
XSL crosswalk for MarcEdit.
This has been a Web Archiving Service video tutorial on how to conduct an XML metadata export.
"You could have this circle right over here, so you see clearly that two points are not enough"
You need three points.
"Three points lead to a triangle, which leads to a unique circle"
So that by itself is kind of cool
Now another question is if I have a circle
And if it circumscribed about an arbitrary triangle is the center of that circle necessarily the circumcenter?
So let's think about that a little bit because there are some non-intuitive cases here.
"So if I draw a circle right over here, its center is right over there, and if I draw an arbitrary triangle where all of the vertices of that triangle are on this circle, is this center necessarily the circumcenter of that triangle?"
So let me draw a crazy situation
Let me draw one where this thing is clearly outside of the triangle.
So we could have one that looks like this and clearly all three vertices sit on the circle.
"So you might first say, wait, there's no way this could be the circumcenter, it's not even inside the triangle."
"But remember, this point right here is equidistant to every point on the circle."
"I should say, every point on the circle is equidistant from this point."
They're all a radius away.
And all three points of this triangle are on the circle
So they are all exactly a radius away from this point right over here.
"So this distance is going to be a radius, this distance right over here is going to be a radius, and this distance right over here is going to be a radius"
"Now, this point is clearly equidistant from that point and that point."
We know that.
It's exactly R away from both of those vertices of the triangle
"So if it's equidistant, and we proved this in a previous video, if it's equidistant from both of those points, it must be on the perpendicular bisector of the segment that joins those two points"
So this must be on the perpendicular bisector.
"So that's perpendicular, and it bisects that segment right over there."
But we can make the same argument for this segment right over here. because this point is R from the center
"We're going to call it point 0, I'm tired of just calling it ""this point"" point O is equidistant from"
"Let me label these, so let's call this A, B, C."
So we already said point O is equidistant from
"C and B, so it must be on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and it's also equidistant from A and B"
It's R away from both because
A and B both sit on the circle they are both a radius away from the center
So it also must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and B.
(Gravelly)Not if Swagron has anything to say about it!
"(Electronically) No way, man."
Swagizo has got this one!
(insecurely) Polly-swag. . .
"(chuckles) Yeah, I think we ran that one into the ground."
Thanks Franz.
My name is Vincent Vanhoucke.
I work on the speech technology team here at Google and I thought I'd try to share with you a single piece of insight that we gain from working on speech technology at Google Scad.
"And that can be summarized basically as such and if you want to get a shot at super-human performance of machinery, maybe the first thing you should try and do is get rid of the humans."
(audience chuckles)
"So, you might be questioning my premise already."
"You might be wondering, ""[He's] talking about super-human speech recognition here."
"And we all know that speech recognition is not at human performance yet."""
The problem is that it's getting dangerously close.
Let me just give you an example.
Imagine- so one of the products is voice search so you can just speak to the search engine and we'll look for it.
You can just talk to it.
"So imagine you can just talk to your phone, you can record that prompt and then we play it back either to yourself or we'll play it back to the speech recognition engine we find in research, okay?"
And we ask for the transcription.
There is no question at this point that you will do a much better job than the speech recognition engine at recognizing your own speech.
The picture changes when if you actually change this up and play the audio to a naive human.
"By naive human, I mean someone who doesn't know you, who doesn't necessarily have the same cultural references as you have, who doesn't necessarily live in the same neighborhood, who doesn't have the same context, then, it actually becomes a toss-up."
If you just play it once to a user and ask them to transcribe it and they will do almost no better than speech recognition.
"So, why is that?"
"Roughly, without going into details, speech recognition is too complex."
There's an acoustic model and an English model.
The acoustic model is what recognizes the sounds and we're not really at human performance yet in acoustic modeling.
"In fact, the fidelity is not yet at the level of a native human speaker."
"But we have this language model, and the language model is what predicts what words you are saying and which order you you are going to say."
"We train similar to machine translation, huge!"
On huge corpuses
We train on 240 billion words for voice search and that gives us an edge that a single user might not have.
I can't believe this is happening.

"*Sheik Sadeg Al Gheryani, Tripoli*"
"In the name of God the merciful, praise be to God the creator of the universe and peace be upon our prophet and his people and all who were guided by his guidance"
"I have been asked, from within the country, from our cities, Misrata and Tripoli and other Libyan cities to clarify what the Libyan people should do in this current situation, in these difficult times."
"I say that what Gaddafi's security brigades are doing in their violent, deliberate indiscriminate attacks on Libyan cities can only make hearts break and is scarcely to be believed"
"The Libyan people, who began their uprising peacefully asking for their rights and still want it to be peaceful, even though the regime has forced them to take up arms the Libyan people must now bear their responsibility."
"In the following way: in the liberated cities, the people must continue to go out in protests to call for their rights and to stress the unity of the country, and to support the countries which have declared their support for the Libyan people, and condemn those countries which have taken an opposing position, and those who are still in the position of spectators, especially the Arab nations must be urged to take a position."
Libyan ex patriot communities must also take on this role.
"In European countries, in Arab countries, in front of embassies."
Because international movement is connected to the popular movement.
"Let's say that I place some textbooks on top of this table, or box, just to make the drawing simpler."
Let's say I place a box there.
"Let's say the box weighs 10 kilograms, which would be about 100 Newtons."
So let's say it weighs about 100 Newtons.
"So what I want to figure out, what I need to figure out, is how much weight is being put onto each of the legs of the table?"
"And this might not have even been obviously a moment problem, but you'll see in a second it really is."
So how do we know that?
"Well, both of these legs are supporting the table, right?"
"Whatever the table is exerting downwards, the leg is exerting upwards, so that's the amount of force that each of the legs are holding."
"So what we do is we pick-- so let's just pick this leg, just because I'm picking it arbitrarily."
"Let's pick this leg, and let's pick an arbitrary axis of rotation."
"Well, let's pick this is as our axis of rotation."
Why do I pick that as the axis of rotation?
Because think of it this way.
"If this leg started pushing more than it needed to, the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"Or the other way, if this leg started to weaken and started to buckle and couldn't hold its force, the table would rotate down this way, and it would rotate around the other"
"leg, assuming that the other leg doesn't fail."
We're assuming that this leg is just going to do its job and it's not going to move one way or the other.
"But this leg, that's why we're thinking about it that way."
"If it was too weak, the whole table would rotate in the clockwise direction, and if it was somehow exerting extra force, which we know a leg can't, but let's say if it was a spring or something like that, then the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"So once we set that up, we can actually set this up as a moment problem."
So what is the force of the leg?
"So the whole table is exerting some type of-- if this leg wasn't here, the whole table would have a net clockwise moment, right?"
The whole table would tilt down and fall down like that.
So the leg must be exerting a counterclockwise moment in order to keep it stationary.
So the leg must be exerting a force upward right here.
"The force of the leg, right?"
We know that.
We know that from basic physics.
There's some force coming down here and the leg is doing an equal opposite force upwards.
So what is that force of that leg?
And one thing I should have told you is all of the distances.
"So his model is the Z electrons filled this volume, this sphere effectively of 10^-10 meters in diameter."
"The electrons filled that up, but somewhere in the center there is something that is very small and very massive that has a diameter of 10^-14 meters."
Because occasionally that alpha particle hit that massive part so most of the mass of the atom is in this nucleus.
"Now, isn't this a great UROP project for Mr. Marsden?"
What did he do?
He discovered the nucleus.
Fantastic.
I also want to tell you that this kind of Rutherford backscattering experiment here is also the basis of the experiment that was done to discover the quark.
"The quark which is the elementary particles that make up the proton, the neutron."
Same idea.
There is a high energy particle that comes into the proton and backscatters from the quark essentially.
"That is an experiment carried out by one of my colleagues in the Physics Department, Jerry Friedman and Henry"
Kendall.
Henry Kendall has since passed away.
But the same idea.
It's really the Rutherford backscattering experiment that was done.
All right.
"Well, now it is time for us to do our own Rutherford backscattering experiment."
"And the way we are going to do that is we're going to be scattering off of this lattice here, this lattice of these Styrofoam balls."
"These Styrofoam balls are gold atoms, gold nuclei, and then the space around them is where the electrons are."
So this is one monolayer of gold atoms.
"Now, this scale is a little wrong."
The real scale would be if we had a pinhead in the center of this room and then the rest of the room was the atom and then there would be another room 10-251 with a pinhead in the center of that.
"That's the real scale, but the fact that the scale isn't right, that's okay."
We are going to be able to understand the principle here.
And what we want to do is we want to be able to measure the diameter of these Styrofoam balls or the diameter of those gold nuclei.
And we're going to measure it by measuring the probability of backscattering.
"And the way we're going to measure the probability of backscattering, the way we are going to do that, is we're going to take these ping-pong balls, and they are going to be our alpha particles."
And we are going to aim them at the lattice.
"And we are going to have a total of 287 ping-pong balls, or 287 alpha particles."
"And so the probability of backscattering will be simply the number backscattered over the total number incident, which will be 287."
So this is what we are going to measure.
let's see how that evolves.
"If they can keep an inclusive tone, or if the impulse they've achieved can't be contained and it all splits up."
But it's clear that the motor has been cranked into action.
That's very important.
ST:
And to finish.
What's the future of the 15M?
JL:
"I think the 15M is a state of mind, it's a diagnosis, and it's an inspiration."
"I think nostalgia is a bad travelling companion for the people who have participated in the 15M, because the Puerta del Sol, the Sol camp, is not going to come back."
"The commission of infrastructures is not coming back... at least not in the same terms,"
I don't know if I'm wrong.
But I think it's very hard for all the perfect conditions to come together again for it to happen like before.
"Sometimes you talk to someone who participated very intensely in it and they say that a better world is possible because when they were there, they were hungry and a lady gave them a dish of maccarroni, and then they helped a commission to put up a stand, then they went to see other people camping on the other side of the city to convince them of whatever..."
"And they tell you all these brutal experiences to justify, or as if it could be reproduced permanently all over the world."
"Some people agree with that and have an ideological justification for it, but I'm not going to go into that kind of thing."
But there are people who are attached to that nostalgia.
And we'll have to wait and see how they manage that nostalgia.
And there I see a danger for the 15M.
Or for what the 15M stands for.
"But I insist, it's a diagnosis."
The 15M is a diagnosis.
It's a state of mind and an inspiration and we're still not conscious of the number of projects that it kick-started in May 2011.
"Neurons have been activated amongst groups of friends, amongst of strangers who suddenly met, things like this documentary have been created."
"There are many projects, audiovisual and not, many projects of many different kinds which were created thanks to the inspiration or the motor of the 15M."
And I think those projects are going to lead the way towards the future of the 15M.
"More than just assemblies, more than demonstrations in the street."
It doesn't matter how many are called.
"But I think the projects that arose, inspired by the 15M will be the 15M of the future."
Even if they're not the 15M.
But the spirit will be there in a mystic kind of way. the 15M will experience those projects because they were born there.
"Contact with international media corporations, international perception of the 15M."
Sorry.
"It looks like I'm not going to get to it, actually."
Thank you.
"What I want you to notice here is that when r goes to infinity, what is the force going to do?"
Zero.
"When those two particles are infinitely far apart, you've got an infinity in the denominator, this force is zero, there is no attraction between them."
"But when r goes to zero, what does that force do?"
Infinity.
"When r is zero, there is an infinity large force."
"And in between, what is happening is that the closer the particles get to each other, the larger the force."
The more attraction there is.
The more they want to be even closer to each other.
All right.
"Now, what this equation is telling me is simply, what is the force of attraction between the nucleus in an electron for a fixed distance r?"
"In other words, if I were holding the electron and the nucleus in my hands at some distance r, that equation would tell me what the force was."
"And you can bet that in order to keep them apart, I would really have to be pulling like this."
You'd feel it.
"But you also know that if you let them go, what would happen is that they would move toward each other."
What this equation does not tell us is how they move toward each other.
It does not tell us how r changes with time.
It doesn't tell us anything about r as a function of time.
"Although we know the force law, we don't know anything from that force law about how those two particles move under influence of that force."
And so what we need is we need an equation of motion.
"And the equation of motion that was known at that time is, of course, Newton's equations of motion, Newtonian mechanics, classical mechanics, the mechanics that governs the motion of all bodies around us that we see easily and astronomical bodies."
"In particular,"
"Newton's second law, F equals ma, this force equals the mass of the particles times the acceleration."
"And, of course, in this acceleration term, well, I think you know what's in there."
"In that acceleration term,"
"let me just write it out, the acceleration then is the change in velocity with respect to time and the velocity is the change in the position r with respect to time."
So we have a second derivative here.
What is in this force law is a way to get r as a function of time under influence of this force.
So we take this force and we substitute it in here and we would be able to solve a differential equation for how those two bodies moved under influence of that force.
I'm just writing V1 here.
We do the reconfig with this member down.
"So now, these guys are on two."
"This one still has one, though, so when it comes back up, and it's trying to recover, it has an old version of the config."
"So it will communicate with the other servers, see that they have newer versions of the config, and grab that version from them."
"Then it will go into a recovery state, pulling data, rolling back, whatever it needs to do, and then eventually, it'll be back into that state and have the new configuration."
So that's fine.
"So in general, our config object is ID, set name, members, and each member of the set has a series of fields, ID."
"However, we can add some extra options to give the system some extra instructions."
"So what we can do is after this host name here, we can then have some options."
So let's talk about what these options can be.
"So, one of the most common options to use is arbiter, and it's actually called arbiterOnly."
"If you specify that, it indicates that the member of the set is what we call an arbiter, in MongoDB terminology."
It means the number has no data whatsoever.
"If we have a set, we might have a primary, a secondary, and an arbiter."
"So there will be replication here, these servers have data and no data."
"However, the arbiter does get to participate in elections, because the challenge without the arbiter in a situation"
"like this, with only two members, is how do you tiebreak on elections if they both want to vote for themselves?"
But consider a case like the following.
"You have a member here, a member here, and these are members of a set, and they're going to talk to each other, and they're trying to do an election."
They're trying to get a consensus on who should be primary.
"They both just booted up, let's say."
The problem is if the network is down.
"So this is our server one, server two, and then we have clients out here, client."
"And imagine we have a network here, and maybe we have some switches."
It's all in one data center in this example.
"Now we have a problem, though, which is this link is broken."
"Well if this server is up-- the mongod process is running on here, yet it's unable to connect to the rest of the world."
"This server is up, its mongod process is running."
It's able to connect to the rest of the world.
"So the question is then, who should be primary?"
"And it seems kind of clear that this one should, obviously and intuitively."
"I know the artistic directions we could take; I ensure media quality, and I have some control of the production process."
"But it's important to involve one more person in this process, and that person is the"
Instructional Design Consultant.
"You should have one assigned to you when you begin teaching, if you haven't been teaching already, and they are aware of course objectives, I don't really know course objectives when you come in, I only know that you need a video done."
"So, it's important to involve the Instructional Designer in that aspect."
They also know the best teaching methods that can be used.
It's important to have this three-way meeting between these people before we move on and actually start creating the video.
"Next, you need to know your format."
There are a few formats that we can use.
"There is: interview, teleprompt, teleprompted PowerPoint, and extemporaneous."
"The interview format is the most natural because it's conversational, it doesn't really require that much preparation because it's whatever happens, you need to have the person next to you to prepare."
"You should be familiar with questions and follow up questions, which means you need to pay close attention to what your guest is speaking about in order to follow up correctly."
Next is the teleprompter.
A teleprompter is...
I'm actually using one right now...
It is a script from a word processing document.
"It's very rigid due to it's word for word nature, and I would suggest not using it."
"Now, I'm not actually using a scripted teleprompter,"
I'm using a PowerPoint teleprompter controlled by an iTouch device.
"I call this teleprompted PowerPoint, or just PowerPoint."
"It's a good alternative to teleprompting because it is not word for word, you don't lose your spot, and it's like using note-cards, but you're not looking down."
"When you look down, away from the screen, it looks awkward and people can tell."
"You can control, again, with an iTouch, and it can't be seen by the camera."
"So, what would you do if you're going to use this format?"
You would e-mail me the PowerPoint.
I'll provide my e-mail at the end of this presentation.
"Do watch out for small text, no less than 24 pt."
"The best way, finally, to approach a format, is to use extemporaneous style."
"That is, without (maybe without) notes, but don't read word for word... it feels very rigid."
"That leads me to my last point, know your presentation."
"All of these techniques, excluding maybe the interview, require a good amount of practice before coming in to film."
"Mistakes can be edited out, but it looks more professional with the less cuts I have to make."
You're talking about yourself and you're doing this in front of two evaluators that you don't know and that it's also going to be recorded and looked at by other people down the road.
So there is a whole bunch of evaluation here.
The evaluators are members of our research team.
So they're going to be watching you and scoring you while you're speaking.
"And the whole time that they're there, they're giving people this negative non-verbal feedback."
"And so they're sitting there very stoically, having no emotions, no facial expressions, frowning, furrowing your brow, they're not nodding, they're not smiling."
"So you can imagine, public speaking isn't so great to start with, then we're getting this negative non-verbal feedback."
What is wrong with me?
What am I doing that's so wrong and their response kind of amps up.
So we see a really strong threat response from this task usually.
Operators are here monitoring physiological signals as they come in real time.
And we now have another task for you to try to evaluate your ability to think on your feet.
"For this task, what we would like for you to do is count backwards, aloud, starting from number 996 in steps of 7."
This is something that participants don't know about until it's kind of thrust on them right then in the moment.
957?
I'm not sure that was right.
"And when you get one wrong, they tell you, ""I'm sorry that was incorrect."
"Please go back to the beginning""."
I'm not sure that was right.
"Please start back at the beginning, 996."
The take home from this whole line of research we've been trying to tell people is that stress isn't bad.
"The responses in our body, the stress responses can actually positively predict cognitive performance."
So people have the higher stresses or the higher amounts of arousal actually do better on their tests than people who don't.
"So when you do need that arousal, when you do need to make some instrumental response, the body's stress response is actually going to help you make those responses better or help you do something better."

The Urban Design master studies (prototypically) fulfills and complies with the promise of interdisciplinary
After studying urban planning and architecture it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg
One of them was... or is... the theoretical background that is applied in our practical work.... that they are really used... also the existent interdisciplinary work that practically occurs with an open source way of thinking that one wouldn't find in any other university.
"What makes this master program for me really very special is ... that we don't only work with students but we also work with the professors, we don't learn something with an top-down approach but we actually are on their same level and we can to a certain point shape the whole master program."
Hello!
My name is Sarah.
I come from Cairo.
I learned German last year because I wanted to study UD in HCU.
Mainly because for me as an architect it was a super chance to work with sociologists and ethnologists together.
And in reality I was never disappointed from such a decision.
My name is Tabea and I worked for the last 5 years as a landscape architect in Switzerland.
"I decided to study Urban Design here in Hamburg since it was important for me to develop my own methods, techniques and tools that could later get incorporated in my professional life."
"What we have been learning here has been also causing a wave of interest to the extent that we have been invited to take part in international workshops, give lectures and to write articles."
Our theme is recycling systems in Hamburg.
We are trying to understand the city as a resource.
As a resource for materials for example.
Materials that today would most probably enter a degradable procedure rather than a revaluation or reassessment procedure.
Our goal is to use those materials to give them value and through that creating new conceptions.
"To be able to work on such a project we were supported by the professors, the economists, the architects, and the sociologists in HCU."
"Even beyond HCU we have asked other experts about topics such as REcycling, waste and UPcycling."
The lamellas are coming straight from a garbage container.
The garbage container is standing right beside my apartment building.
And all the time... when I walk pass it...
"I come by new items thrown by people, and when something interesting appears I would take it with me and in this case it was the lamellas, and this is now the 5th lamp that we've brought together."
I'm not able to trace that reference.
Alright.
"So I said, well, well good."
"They gave two references, so I have hope here."
So I went to reference fourteen.
"Pulled up, the paper."
It was a paper.
"Scanned through the paper, did a search on the paper."
"It did not contain the words the ambient sunlight, the word mountain, or the word"
"UVC and I didn't do UVC lighting, I just did UVC."
So there was no mention of any of those things in that paper.
"So, it was a reference to nowhere, because what the authors were giving me as their backup for that statement, it just didn't exist at least not in those references."
"So I wasn't able to ever get that information, cuz it wasn't at least where the authors told me it was."
"So that's an example of references nowhere and again, I think this happens a lot."
"So, you know, if you can avoid it in your own writing, hopefully, by doing a good prewriting step, by carefully organizing your information before you start, and keeping your, you know, that information with the references early on you won't make these kinds of mistakes where you just have references that don't actually back up what you're saying."
"And then finally, the citation propagation concept like telephone I was, I was saying before."
This was one of my pet peeves and so I just want to point out an example of this and caution you to avoid citing secondary sources.
"So, when I was a graduate student, I worked on, something called female athlete triad."
"And one of the components of that triad was something we called disordered eating, which itself is kind of poorly defined, but in any case, a part of the triad is disordered eating."
"So people would always want to say, well, how common is disordered eating in female athletes?"
"And at the time that I was a graduate student and writing out papers on this,"
"In the late 90's or early 2000's, there was Hallmark statistic that everybody cited."
"It's, the statistic was that fifteen to 62% have disordered eating."
And that was just in every paper on female athletes triad eating disorders in athletes.
That's just the one that everybody gave.
"However, it wasn't like they all cited the same source."
"If you, I was trying to trace back at one point where that statistic came from and I found about 50 different attributions for where that statistic came from."
"So one paper would cite Smith et al., another paper would cite Jones et al and they all cited different things."
Well obviously that statistic came from somewhere.
"So, everybody's citing secondary sources."
"So, I want to give you some examples."
"So, this was from a paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine."
"Arley, maybe set the stage with your own take on the budget."
The big picture.
"Where do you see this going in terms of a negotiation for Grand Bargain, the likelihood of that happening, the politics in the"
House especially?
"And then set the stage, if you will, for the challenges that CSBG is going to face which are going to be very, very big for FY ""14."
Arley:
I'll probably speak briefly about CSBG and then have the CSBG presentation and then speak a little bit more to that.
"In terms of the budget, and the key word is politics, the President is doing his best at this present time to try and get a Grand Bargain."
And the Grand Bargain was that he was trying to negotiate with the help of John Boehner last year prior to everything concerning sequestration.
There appear to be enough votes and some republican and democrat support in the House on what we would call a grand Bargain.
"And, of course, the issue there is whether you raise taxes a little bit more or whether you cut spending."
And what's been proven by the sequester is you cannot tax your way to prosperity and you cannot spend your way to prosperity either.
It's obvious the draconian cuts hinder and stifle the economy.
"And to cause money to grow in the economy, you've got to spend money."
After
"WWII and with the depression, FDR did it during the depression by spending money."
"When no one has money, when there's a low ebb and flow of money in the country, the government prints more money."
The government makes more money and the government puts people to work.
That's the reason why the President is concentrated on the stimulus programs.
"You hear him talking about the infrastructure, talking about roads and bridges, also talking about high speed rail and those types of things."
That's what the administration wants to do.
You have to juxtapose that against what some of the right wing of the
Republican Party want to do.
They want to cut everything.
You can't cut everything.
You've got to spend money in order to generate jobs.
In order to have jobs you've got to put some money into the industry and into different areas of the economy.
One good sign that's going on is it appears that the housing market is rebounding.
"As the housing market goes so goes construction, so goes long-term jobs."
The housing market is a good indicator that the economy is turning around.
"In terms of the unemployment rate, it is steadily coming down."
Even though there weren't that many jobs created in the last month overall the trend is still good.
"But with attacking two chemicals, so, being a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, we can sometimes see benefit and therapeutic outcomes."
So you have to balance this spectrum.
"So, the first group we're going to talk about is the SNRls, which is the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors."
So this is a reuptake pump inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine.
"So we're not only going to prevent serotonin from being sucked back up by the brain, and not be able to be used, but we're going to increase norepinephrine in the same manner."
"The first SNRI is Venlafaxine, and this is"
Effexor and Effexor XR.
"This is dosed twice a day, anywhere from 75-300mg total."
Your mechanism of action is as a SNRl.
We have a couple different indications.
"How this drug needs to be managed is, we need to go slow in terms of initiation."
We need a slow titration because of the side effect profile.
"Again, this medication is a very effective medication to be used, but it needs to be titrated slowly, because there are a lot of side effects."
So it's very difficult to get patients on and off of this medication.
The nausea and diarrhea is very severe.
"This situation, you actually want to use the extended release preparation, because there are"
less side effects associated with the extended release.
"Similar side effects to the SSRls: headaches, sexual side effects, the increase in anxiety, and insomnia."
"We do see an increase in blood pressure, especially as we get to the higher doses of the medicine, and it's usually isolated systolic increase."
"So you have to use this with caution in certain patient populations, potentially."
"And again, use that long-acting formulation to avoid side effects."
"Interestingly enough, with this medication, you need to be at the higher end of the dosing spectrum to get that double-action effect."
"At the lower end, in initiation of the medication, up until about 150mg, you're really only getting action as an SSRl, so as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
You're not hitting both neurotransmitters until the higher level dosing.
"Again, I mentioned this medication needs to be titrated slowly: there's a significant withdrawal, again, with the medicine, so, like I said, it's very hard to get on and off of, but it's a very effective medication in treatment."
The next SNRI is one of our newest antidepressants:
"Duloxetine, or Cymbalta."
"Anywhere from 20-60mg a day, and, again, an SNRl."
The main difference with this is that patients get the dual action right away.
"Versus Venlafaxine, it took to get to the higher dosing spectrum."
This we get right away.
"Nausea, insomnia, and headache are the most reported side effects."
"But they can be very substantial victims, I mean, in this case in Afghanistan, individual soldiers who have lost their lives, have lost all their life."
However it is true that the kill ratios for this war are disturbing.
"So, the event that I just showed you before, of 181 people being killed,"
There was one US soldier who died versus 181 people who were claimed to be Taliban.
When you have kill ratios like that war becomes indiscriminate.
And when the vehicles for killing are aerial
"AC130 Gunships or Apaches, you really have a video game."
Because you press the button and you see an explosion and there's very little effect on you.
Everyday people walk down the street and step on ants and no one pays too much attention because ants can't defend themselves.
"So we, I think, should actually never be in a position where militaries are so unequal in their relationship because that leads inevitably to abuse."
Ann please.
Thank you.
My name is Ann Linda.
I'm from the Social Democratic Party and I have two questions.
"One is the most attention has been given to those leaks that have been about war, in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Are you intentionally trying to get [your] most attention to these or are you also trying to get attention, for example, on exploitation, child work, or forced labor, or things like that."
Or is it peace and war that are
Wikileaks' main area of concentration?
"And the second question is do you care how the material you get is gotten, in a way?"
"And the question is because in Sweden, to simplify it, if you are in authority and say something to journalists, the authorities cannot see from where the leak is."
That's forbidden.
"But if someone is trying to break in to get the same material, then it's forbidden."
And they could be taken to court.
Do you care if somebody breaks in to get the material or do you only take material that someone on the inside has given to you?
Yea.
"For focus, we are very clear to prospective whistleblowers and journalists or other people who have been censored what we do and do not do."
I think that is one of our strengths as a media organization is that we do not see ouselves as merely representing an opinion and then looking for news that backs up that opinion.
Rather we see our role as representatives of people who have information to provide the public.
We see our role like lawyers.
Lawyers represent their clients to a court and to a jury.
"We represent sources, whistleblowers and people whose freedom of speech is under threat to the jury of public opinion."
And so we try and get as much impact for their material as possible.
"A mysterious, massive cluster of stars, that we'd now call a galaxy."
"And back then, what we could know about the universe was limited by the amount of data that we could collect, and things just aren't the same anymore."
"Modern astrophysics looks not like this, but like this."
A picture of a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
"Each dot, an individual system of  hundreds of billions of suns."
"And if we want to understand the evolution of the universe, if we want to understand how we got this wonderful universe that we see around us, we need to study these galaxies."
But there's a problem.
The problem is that we don't really like the universe that we've ended up with.
We've got this 96% of the universe in a form that we don't understand.
In dark matter and dark energy.
And so we need to pay closer attention to each one of these millions and billions of galaxies.
"We need to treat them not as points of light, but as individual spirals or galaxies, because the shapes of the galaxies tell us about their history."
So you can tell that this spiral galaxy  has had a very different past from a big ball of stars that we call the elliptical.
That's what we set out to do.
We set out to try and identify the shapes of the galaxies.
And that's a task that humans are much better at than computers.
"We're very good at this sort of pattern recognition task, and computers are really rather poor."
"We tried getting a student to look at a million galaxies, and I can tell you that, after about  the first 50,000, they give up."
And so we needed a new solution.
We decided to call for help.
"We set up a web site called ""Galaxy Zoo""."
This is what it looks like today.
"And Galaxy Zoo asked everyone in the world to help us classify these galaxies, to say what shape they are."
"And on the first couple of days at Galaxy Zoo, we got this amazing response."
"We were doing 70,000 galaxy classifications every hour."
"And while we haven't continued at that speed, over time, we've done hundreds of millions of classifications from hundreds of thousands of people."
"And the even better news is that, taken together, those classifications are more accurate than those supplied by professional astronomers."
"The crowd does not make mistakes, and it has endless enthusiasm for this task of sorting through pictures of the universe."
But actually that's not the interesting part.
Something else very interesting happens when you invite hundreds of thousands of people  to take part in your research.
"What happens is that you have to remember that yes, there's a crowd, but the crowd is made up of individuals."
So here's one of our classifiers.
"We believe that secrecy is trumped by honesty, and corporate interest by community."
We believe that the web is more cared for than owned.
More of a resource to be tended to than a mere commodity to be sold.
And we strongly believe in innovation that puts users front and center and squarely in the driver seat.
"But most importantly, we believe in you."
"We believe that the world's best browser is made possible by engineers, programmers, designers, people just like you, who give their time, talents, energy and support to the cause."
"And we believe that together with this cause in mind we can continue to innovate for the benefit of the individual and the betterment of the web, so that it always and forever serves the greater good."
We are all Mozilla Firefox.
We are not just a different kind of browser.
We are a browser that's making a difference.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; We are now going to discuss the multivariate normal distribution.
The multivariate normal distribution is a very important distribution in finance.
"It crops up in many different applications including, for example, mean variance analysis and asset allocation, as well as geometric Brownian motion and the"
Black-Scholes[UNKNOWN].
"So we say an n-dimensional vector, X, is multivariate normal with mean vector Mu and covariance matrix Sigma; if the PDF of"
X is given to us by this quantity here.
"Okay, so the PDF is equal to 1 over 2 pi to the power of n over 2, times the terminant of the covarience matrix raised to the power of a half, times the exponential of this quantity up here."
"And be right that X is multivariate normal Mu, sigma."
"The little subscript n here, denotes the dimensionality of the vector x."
"The standard multivariate normal, has mean vector mu equal to 0, and variance covariance matrix equal to the n by n identity matrix."
"And in this case, the xi's are independent."
"We can actually see that, because in this case we can write, the joint PD f of x, as being equal to the product."
I equals one to in.
One over route to pie e to the minus a half x i squared.
"And that follows just from this line here because mu equals zero so this term disappears, and Sigma is just the identity."
"So, in fact, you just end up with a sum of xi squared divided by 2."
So as we saw in an earlier module on multivariant distributions.
"If the joint PDF factorizes into a product of marginal PDF's, then the random variables are independent."
Okay.
The moment generating function of x is given to us by this quantity here.
So phi subscript x of s is actually a function of s.
Okay this vector s.
"You may say, ""But the water is cold!"""
You need to understand that there is nothing that is not energy
"### and the water, no matter how fast it is occurring internally, is energy. ###"
"Put your hand into the cold water, then get some warm water and put your hand into the warm water, and try to feel."
"If you are somewhere that windy hard, try to learn with the wind, to feel the wind."
"There is one thing we don't pay much attention, but our chakras work with types of energy."
"For example, the sex chakra, what kind of energy does it work with?"
"It works with dense energies, it will work with pasty energies, right?"
"It will work with energies like the wind, it works with that energy."
Any energy that touches your body is identified by your sex chakra.
"So, these are the energies that sex chakra will deals with."
"For example, water is a liquid energy, but it can handle that energy, it responds to it."
This answer will be better defined according to the competence of your chakra.
"So if you take, for example, the coronary chakra, it does a very different reading than sex chakra."
"If you, for example, touch the water, the same water you are touching with your hands, to feel the sex chakra, pour a bit of this water over your head and try to feel."
Perhaps you'll be able to perceive the difference that exists in the perception of each chakra.
"You may say ""But I'm using my hands"""
"No, you can use the foot, you can use any part of the body."
"But when I'm talking about coronary chakra,"
"I'm certainly speaking about the farthest chakra of sex chakra, where perceptions are different."
"If you do something with the other chakras that are close to the sex chakra you'll not be able to fell, you'll not be able to perceive the difference."
"So, sex chakra and coronary chakra, will provide different perceptions."
You can also perceive this when the wind touch on your face.
"Feel the wind on your face and then feel the wind on your legs, check if there is a difference in perception."
"If you are very emotional, this difference hardly appears."
"If your consciousness is already at heart chakra, at the top or above, it becomes very clear."
"It's the same process for a person who is clairvoyant, when a person can see more images and distinguish better than someone else."
"So if you show someone a landscape, that landscape can be read in many ways."
"A person who is very advanced level, the reading of everything is much more acurated."
It's like you looking at a person.

Someone will look and not see anything and the other will see many details in that person.

"Fatiha, amin. salam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu. for those of you who didnt pray your uh... tarawih. we have already prayed, so pray your tarawih, pray your isha, pray your tarawih, inshAllah ar-Rahman"
"If Allah give us the lives, we will see each other again, salam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.  have a good night"
Let's look at some of the options you can use with replica sets.
"The config we used earlier, we didn't use any options, we just used the defaults."
"And as you saw, that worked pretty well."
"But there are some options available for your use, so"
let's go through some of those.
"So, if we look at the configuration we used before, we'll see here we basically just have the host names we want to use."
"They have ordinal IDs, the name of the set, and that's basically it."
"This version field is added by the server, and it will just keep track of changes to the configuration and increment the version on each change, so that we can notice changes, and helps the different members the set know if they have the latest version of the config or not."
"They talk to each other, and if someone else has a newer version, they will grab it, then."
"So, for example, you can do re-configurations when a member is down."
"So, a set has a configuration, we might want to change it, right?"
"Something's changed, new server, new replication factor, whatever."
We may want to change.
"That can be done, of course."
"So if you imagine we had a set, we'll just go with the case where there's three servers again, which is the common case, and they're all running, it's all fine."
"Maybe something like this, primary, secondary, secondary."
We're running along.
Imagine the server goes down.
"Even with the server down, we can still do a reconfiguration of the set."
"To do a reconfigure of the set requires that the majority of the members of the set, of the voters, are up."
"So, we have a majority."
"We have one, two out of three."
"So that's a majority, proper majority, so we can do it."
"And what we'll do is we'll use the replSetReconfig command, which has helpers."
"For example, rs.reconfig in the shell is a helper."
"But you will send that command to the primary of the set, and if a majority of the set is up, you will have a primary, and then you can do that."
"So, if we consider now a reconfiguration occurring on the set, and we were on, say, V1 of the set's config, and everyone has a local copy of that in local.system.replSet collection, if the set's been initiated, they'll have that."
"So that document's currently on version colon one, which,"
A little bit of code on this side.
[Inaudible].
Okay.
Pop empty cell.
I've got that.
"Oh,"
"I think I may have proved, oh, it deliberately makes the error, in fact."
That it was designed to test on that.
[Inaudible] up to the end.
"So let's see if we get back a three, two, one out of this guy."
Okay.
So we manage to do okay even on that.
"So looking at this piece of code, all right, the two operations we're most interested in, push and pop, right, are each oh of one, right."
"The number of elements out there, right, aren't changing anything about its performance."
"It does a little bit of imagination and a little bit of pointer arrangement up here to the front to the end and so it has a very nice tight allocation strategy, too, which is appealing relative to what the vector-based strategy was doing."
"It's like, now, it's doing things in advance on our behalf like extending our capacity so that every now and then we had some"
"little glitch right when you were doing that big resize operation that happened infrequently, you won't have that same concern with this one because it does exactly what it needs at any given time, which is allocate a single cell, deletes a single cell, and also keeping the allocation very tidy in that way."
So they'll both end of being oh of one.
And both of these are commonly used viable strategies for how a stack is implemented.
Right.
"Depending on the, you know, just the inclination of the program or they may have decided one way was the way to go versus another that you will see both used in common practice because there really isn't one of them that's obviously better or obviously worse, right."
"Now, this uses a little bit more memory per cell, but then you have excess capacity and vector has excess capacity but no overhead per cell."
There's a few other things to kind of think about trading off.
"You say, well, the code, itself, is a little harder to write if you're using only [inaudible]."
"That means it's a little bit more error prone and more likely, you'll make a mistake and have to do debug your way through it and the way with the vector it was pretty easy to get without tearing out your hair."
"Now, if we can do stack and queue that fast -"
"I mean, stack that fast, then you figure queue must be not so crazy either."
Let me draw you a picture of queue.
Okay.
I've got my queue and I can use the
"End queue operation on it to put in a 10, to put in a 20, to put in a 30."
And
"You didn't get that parking ticket that irked you so much... or you, unfortunately, never met your wife."
Anything that is physically possible actually does occur... in some other parallel universe.
"It means that in one universe, Elvis Presley is still alive."
In a different level-one universe...
George W. Bush is the baseball commissioner.
Or perhaps we don't exist at all in some of these universes.
The implications are staggering.
And if the universe is infinite... and there really are all these level-one universes... in the infinite multiverse... all those other possibilities did somewhere happen.
"Technically, there are a couple of ways mathematically... for the universe to be truly infinite... but, essentially, it must be shown to be flat."
The universe seems to be perfectly flat... which means either the universe is flat... or is curved so slightly that we can't see it.
"In this case, the universe would eventually curve back in on itself... and form a hypersphere."
It would then be finite in size and volume... and not flat and infinite.
Another way to look at this is that the universe... may have inflated so quickly and so enormously... that it only looks flat.
Think of a bug walking on a gigantic balloon.
"The larger the balloon, the flatter things get."
"The bug walks in any direction, and the bug says..."
"""Well, the universe seems perfectly flat to me."""
But from a distance... we see that the bug is walking on a gigantic balloon.
But now an amazing new tool... the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or WMAP... is changing everything.
Some say the remarkable images reveal the true shape of the universe.
"What we have here are baby pictures of the universe... what it looked like when it was only 400,000 years old."
We're looking so far back in time... that the galaxies hadn't even formed yet.
"We just had this dead, diffuse gas which, gradually, overtime... clumped into galaxies, stars, planets."
The WMAP is catching the very earliest signs of creation.
"Officially, it is tasked with measuring radiation..."
left over from the Big Bang.
But now some scientists have devised an experiment... to calculate the overall shape of the universe.
"If I send light rays through space... and make a gigantic triangle, going from us here... out to the farthest edges of what we can see and then back... the angles of those- that triangle should add up to exactly 180 degrees."
If the universe is curved like a balloon... the angles of the giant triangle would add up... to more than 180 degrees.
To find out if the universe is flat or curved... they shot laser beams deep into space... and made a giant light triangle.
"Now we can tell, and the measurement is in... and the answer is, it works beautifully."
The angles add up to exactly 180 degrees.
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
So it must also be on this perpendicular bisector
"And finally, it also is equidistant from A and C. because those are both R away they both sit on the circle"
So it must be on the perpendicular bisector of AC as well
So AC is right over here.
And this is what the interesting thing is
"We're seeing that the three perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of this triangle they do definitely intersect, but they're intersecting at a point outside of that triangle"
And that point is the center of this circle.
"So once again, that last idea is"
"O is equidistant from A and C, so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and C"
Which would look something like this
"So once again, we see that three perpendicular bisectors are intersecting at a unique point and O really is the circumcenter so, if you take any circle and you put any triangle whose vertices all sit on that circle, the center of that circle is its circumcenter"
So we just drew a situation where this is a circumcenter that sits outside of the triangle proper.
So point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle.
And point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle right over here.
It's going to sit on all three perpendicular bisectors and we know that because it's equidistant from all three points of any of these triangles where the vertices sit on the circle itself.

"When you listen to your favourite piece of music, your ears pick up on the very wide range of frequencies, from the deepest rumblings of the bass to the very highest pitched vibrations."
Now imagine your ears were only sensitive to a very limited range of frequencies.
You'd miss out on most of the good stuff!
But that's essentially that situation that astronomers are in.
Our eyes are only sensitive to a very narrow range of light frequencies: visible light.
But we are completely blind to all other forms of electromagnetic radiation.
"However, there are many objects in the Universe that do emit radiation at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"For example, in the 1930s it was discovered by accident that there are radio waves coming from the depths of space."
"Some of these waves have the same frequency as your favourite radio station, but they are much weaker and, of course, there's nothing to listen to."
"In order to ""tune in"" to the radio Universe, you need some sort of receiver: a radio telescope."
Right.

"And, you would select controls using, using standards and, you know, Barbara I know has talked to you about a number of standards and you're probably aware of other sets of standards."
"I mean, there are no shortage of standards out there. and then, you would make the security check"
list.
"And then, step two is you would analyze the gaps and you'd do that using the checklist."
"And then, when there's a gap, you'd do whatever you need to do in terms of remediation to either close that gap or to reduce the expenditures in areas where your level of control is higher than what's specified by the analysis."

"(Ken Robinson) Every country on Earth, at the moment, is reforming public education."
There are two reasons for it.
The first of them is economic.
People are trying to work out how do we educate our children to take their place in the economies of the 21st century?
How do we do that?
"Even though we can't anticipate what the economy will look like  at the end of next week, as the recent turmoil is demonstrating."
How do we do that?
"The second, though, is cultural."
"Every country on Earth, on earth is trying to figure out how do we educate our children so they have a sense of cultural identity, and so that we can pass on the cultural genes of our communities, while being part of the process of globalization?"
How do we square that circle?
The problem is they're trying to meet the future by doing what they did in the past.
"And on the way, they're alienating millions of kids who don't see any purpose in going to school."
"When we went to school, we were kept there with a story, which is, if you worked hard and did well and got a college degree,  you would have a job."
Our kids don't believe that.
"And they're right not to, by the way."
"You're better having a degree than not, but it's not a guarantee anymore."
And particularly not if the route to it marginalizes most of the things that you think are important about yourself.
"Some people say we have to raise standards, as if this is a breakthrough."
"You know, like, really, yes we should."
Why would you lower them?
[laughter]
I haven't come across an argument that persuades me of lowering them.

"The best time to cry is at night when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help,"
"Hello, everyone."
"I'm Amanda D'Annucci and I'm going  to be talking to you about storytelling, conflict resolution,  psychology and neuroscience."
"Did you know that  by telling someone a story, instead of spewing out  a mouthful of data, that you can engage a much larger  portion of their brain?"
The art of storytelling has psychological  and neurological basis that scientifically explains the natural human predilection for narrative.
"A vast portion of a person's brain is activated during the listening to, and telling of a story"
"For instance, the amygdala hippocampus system, which is responsible  for preliminary encoding of episodic and autobiographic memories is engaged; the left perisylvian region where language is created is engaged; and also, it has been proven  that the same sections of the brain lights up when the storyteller or the respective listener interacts."
"Quite simply, narrative engages the entire human brain, the entire human experience."
"If a string of word can affect a person in such a profound way, how powerful can the art of story be?"
"Stories can heal, stories can teach, stories can inspire, stories can enlighten stories can resolve."
"For my master thesis here at Gallatin,"
I'm exploring the power of story and relation to conflict resolution  and peace making.
Story is an influential tool which  can mold the most obstinate of minds by means of appealing  to an individual's pathos.
"By using story as a communication tool, a pessimist understanding can be  made into a relatable situation."
There's an ample evidence of storytelling  in a multitude of cultures around mankind.
Every night!
"Something is seriously askew, and we should really talk about it."
"Right now, half of the total global wheat harvest is used as livestock feed to support our meat and dairy consumption."
"Half of the entire harvest, while, at the same time, people in poor countries are starving."
And there doesn't seem to be an end to this.
We keep on consuming more and more and more.
"And, in the future, we will have to exploit other people's natural resources even more than we do now."
"And this will be at the expense of those people, clean water, clean air and also our environment."
"So, let me sum this up for you."
Scientists say that it simply takes far more land and energy to produce animal protein than plant-based ones.
To produce animal products you need up to ten times as much land as is needed to produce vegetable products.
And this is due to the fact that all this land is needed to produce feed for these billions of farm animals.
Films like An Inconvenient Truth have made a very important contribution to the debate on global warming.
Yet the only cow that I saw on-screen symbolised little Al's picture-perfect youth in Tennessee.
In the whole Inconvenient Truth not a single word was said about
"livestock farming, or the impact of this polluting industry."
"Dr. Steinfeld, how is it possible that livestock doesn't play a role in the discussion about global warming?"
"Well, I think that the fact is that in the climate change discussion much of the focus is on carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide emissions if you look at the livestock sector only make up about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions."
"Nitrous oxides and methane don't come very strongly into the debate, but they are much more potent in terms of greenhouse gasses and carbon dioxide and they need to be factored in."
But Al Gore didn't say one single word about the livestock industry in his documentary.
What do you think?
Didn't you miss the aspect as well?
It is certainly missing; the entire aspect of food is missing.
And I think that everyone needs to know that food and agriculture contributes to climate change and has environmental impact.
"And that one needs to make choices, if one wants to be environmentally friendly, that are in line with the environmental impact of producing various types of food."
"Well, I think that he should have said something about it."
Have you ever tried to convince him?
"Well, I'm not someone who knows Al Gore personally."
"I think that at my level publishing results and talking at conferences, and talking to the media such as in this case is all I can do."
"Well, thank you."
He doesn't know it either.
"So, I went to the United States to find an answer to this question."
"Just like here in this country if you have the money, you go-- you try doctor after doctor; hospital after hospital; drug after drug in order to find a cure."
"The family tried former lovers, former spouses of lovers, people he had dealings with in nearby villages."
They were on the fourth or fifth tribe and they were suspecting a woman in a village just to the north.
Ferdinand had taken some of her goods to the market to sell but he had given all the money back that he owed her.
"But before they got an answer about her, Ferdinand had died."
"So if they'd found the witch in time, they could have saved his life."
These stories show how witchcraft brings social conflicts the surface and resolves them openly.
"You confront the suspected witch; you apologized; you negotiate; you right the wrong; you pay the compensation, and you get better, hopefully."
"So, in this sense, witchcraft could be seen as a means of conflict resolution."
"And for all you future doctors, witchcraft does not contradict science complements it."
The Zande acknowledge that the pills that they take and the shots that they get the medical clinics work.
And they love them.
But they also know that medicine alone cannot cure a serious illness.
The medicine will only work if the witchcraft is withdrawn.
So they have to [inaudible] the social reason as well as the medical cause of the illness.
Or not just the medical cause of the illness.
They find and confront the wish or the person will get better.
Even educated Zande who understand biology and physiology can still believe in witchcraft just as many Western doctors can still believe in God.
"The biology and the physiology explain the how-- the mechanism-- but not the why no matter how good a scientist you are, you probably can't explain why a mutation occurs in one person rather than another."
"And you may have noticed that while explaining and healing, this belief system also allows people to blame other people for their misfortune."
This idea is not foreign to the United States.
"Where if you spill your hot coffee and it burns your thighs, you can blame it on the fast food store that sold you the coffee."
"In fact, there seems to be a tendency among us humans to blame someone else for our misfortunes."
Witchcraft is one way of doing that.
"But instead of blaming an institution, a government, a foreign people, a God or a devil, the Zande blame their neighbors."
People they know and interact with daily.
They can confront a suspected witch and resolve the problem face-to-face.
"The truth is, people are always doing things that make us mad."
They take the last parking spot.
They cut us off in traffic.
They get the last tickets to a concert or to a [inaudible] event.
They get a job we want.
"So, if the interval is zero, that means that the distance between the events in light-years, for example, is equal to the time separation in years, because that's--because this term has to be exactly equal to that term there, in order for them to subtract out and get zero."
And the c^(2) converts from light-years to years and back again.
"And so, what does that mean?"
"That means if you emit a photon at one event, that same photon can, if it's going in the right direction, be present at the second event."
"So, if you ride along with light you'll see both--you'll participate in both these events."
"So, you sit at event one."
You flash a light.
"You ride along with the expanding light waves from that event and you get to something one light-year away, exactly a year later."
"And so, if the second event is one light-year away in distance and a year later in time, that same photon will be present at the second event, as at the first event."
"So, things that have one of these intervals of zero are separated by an appropriate amount so that the same ray of light can participate in both of them."
"So, if the interval--let's keep that up there for a minute."
"If the interval is negative, what does that mean?"
The distance is less than the light travel time.
"So, the photon is already past the second event."
"So, if you were to emit a ray of light at event number one, it would have passed the second event by the time it occurred."
The photon has already gone by.
"And similarly, if the interval is positive, then the light photon hasn't reached event two--hasn't yet reached event two."
"Now, this is important, because this means that you can't communicate from event one to event two."
"So, if you're at event two, you don't know what happened at event one."
"Because even if you'd sent out a signal, a radio signal or whatever, it would not have reached you by the time event two takes place."
So you can't communicate from event one to event two.
"And similarly, you can't travel from event one and reach event two, because you'd have to go faster than the speed of light to do it."
"These kinds of intervals, these negative intervals, these are called time-like, because the time term is larger than the distance turn."
And these kinds of intervals are called space-like intervals.
And you can only travel or communicate over time-like intervals.
Yes?
Student:
What are these so-called events?
Professor Charles
Bailyn:
"So, they're events--you can think of them as points in space-time."
"So, they have a particular position in space and a particular point in time."
"I got 5,000 unknowns, I've got, 500 constraints, you know what?"
"Four and a half thousand of these are going to just be zero, I know that from the beginning."
Have to pick out which ones.
"But if you did a histogram, you could see this big spike, of information zero."
"Its going to try to set, four and a half thousand things to zero."
"Its not going to try, it will set, and its going to pick 500 things to be non-zero that satisfy this and give you this small L norm."
"Okay, Promotes sparsity and the fact is you know there's sparsity in the signal, okay."
In this section we're going to talk about celiac disease and the gluten free diet.
So what is celiac disease?
Celiac is an autoimmune disease.
"It's also called gluten sensitive enteropathy, or celiace sprue."
"In celiac disease, gluten, which is a component of food, leads to villus atrophy, in the small intestine."
"The only therapeutic approach that has been known to treat celiac disease effectively, is maintenance of and adherence to a gluten-free diet."
Here's a picture of what villus atrophy
looks like.
On the left-hand side you can see what a normal healthy small intestine looks like.
"You notice all of these finger-like projections, the villi, which is where the majority of nutrients are absorbed."
"In celiac disease, the presence of gluten in the foods cuts down the height of the intestinal villi, and you end up with this flattened surface, like you see here."
"A flattened surface like this, cannot effectively absorb nutrients."
And so the people who have celiac disease end up having a variety of deficiencies of micro nutrients.
"Not to mention, absorption problems that often times result in things like diarrhea."
How prevalent is celiac disease?
Well researchers go back and forth about just how many people we think have it.
"One of the problems is, many people who have celiac disease are not diagnosed."
"In the US, historically, we've said that the rates are 1 in 133, there's other statistics that suggest it might be more"
like 1 in 100.
"In Europe, it's somewhere between that amount, and it's even higher in individuals who have a first degree relative."
"So the likelihood is that you have a 1 in 22 chance, of having celiac, if you have a first degree relative with it."
"Again, one of the problems is, that very few people who have celiac disease are actually ever diagnosed."
"We're seeing increasing rates of diagnosis with celiac disease, not because more people are getting it, but because the testing mechanism is more sensitive and more specific."
"And to be honest, practitioners are looking for celiac more now than they did previously."
A study that was done recently in the
A good example of a house in a more rural part of Connecticut.
"So keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own behavior, the way you grew up, and you try to consider how your lifestyle choices influenced your family's consumption level."
"Also, I want you to think about the idea of size, and how we are increasingly dependent upon many consumer products in our lives that are larger than they used to be."
And housing is no exception.
"So that the average house size in 2009 is grown to about 2,500 square feet, with about two point three on average people per house."
That's really pretty remarkable.
"So you know, roughly 1,000 square feet per person."
"Whereas back in 1950, the average number of people in a house was much closer to three, a little bit over three with the post-World War II baby boom, with a total size of 800 square feet."
So the house size has grown by three fold.
"In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet."
So the energy demands of a larger house like that are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into account the diversity of building materials.
"Boy, I apologize for this."
"And, you know, one of you might go outside and"
let them know that there's a lecture going on in here.
That would be really nice.
The construction is creating also diesel fumes inside the building.
Many of the garages that you find in suburban areas also have grown in size.
So here's an example of a garage that is actually larger than the average house size was back in 1950.
"This is probably about a twenty-two, twenty-three by thirty foot house."
"So that's roughly 1,200 square feet, pretty interesting."
Now think about the way that space is laid out.
So here's a studio apartment on the right hand side.
"And you see a dining table, a kitchenette, walk-in closet and a bath on the upper level."
Whereas the base level is dominated by a garage.
So that we're allocating less space indoors to our bedrooms than we are to our auto storage areas.
"Also, many buildings are now constructed with much more glass in them than previously."
And the newer high-end buildings are using special glass that is designed to reflect radiation so that it's not absorbed.
But different glasses are really designed for different climatic regions so that some are more efficient at reflecting radiation that are used in southern climates that are warmer.
"And others are more efficient at providing insulation, so they've got a barrier in the interior that basically protects against heat loss."
"So that overall though, buildings' increased use of windows has created increased energy demands."
Also lighting.
And also the way that we have increasingly designed bathrooms to have more than one fixture.
"And you can see, in blue we have the three peaks, where the immediate release is up to three times a day."
The sustained release goes up to twice a day.
"So you can see that same coverage of spectrum, and the XL is once a day."
"You're going to get ultimately equivalent doses, and equivalent action throughout the day, with whatever agent you use."
"But the XL, actually, is I think a nice drug option in this population, if it's actually covered on the insurance."
"They're almost all generic now, so it is becoming not an issue."
"But the Buproprion XL is just a nice, clean agent that we can utilize so we don't have issues with"
late evening activation or anything like that.
Mirtazapine is probably one of the most confusing agents we have.
It's an Alpha-2 antagonist.
And we're going to try to walk through how the medication works.
This is not a reuptake inhibitor.
So it's a completely different shift of how we're doing antidepressants.
"It's that we're actually going to try to stimulate the manufacturing, so to speak, of the neurotransmitters."
"So, you can see that we have action on the alpha 2 antagonist's effects, to increase both serotonin and norepinephrine."
And we do this - inserting this drug - on different areas of the neurotransmitters.
"And then, these two neurons talk to each other with the end result of increasing norepinephrine, which is actually the triangles, and the serotonin, which is the little yellow tadpoles."
"So, you do get a dual-action, it's just not in the same way that we've done in the past, where we've kindof blocked that pump action, where the neurotransmitter can't get sucked back up."
This time we're actually trying to stimulate action.
"So, Mirtazapine has multiple formulations, again."
"Remeron, Remeron Sol Tab, Mirtazapine, and Mirtazapine Sol Tab."
The SoluTab does not have any absorption increase rate.
It's just a benefit in patients who have swallowing difficulties.
It's not absorbed in the mouth; it just dissolves.
"Which might be helpful in the elderly, for example."
"This is an Alpha 2 antagonist 5HT3, 2A, 2C antagonist."
"So, what we'll show you in the next slide is how we're kind of targeting where - directing, exactly which serotonin receptors we want the serotonin to go to once we've increased it, to help control some of the side effects."
The dosage is anywhere from 15 to 45 milligrams to be dosed at bedtime.
The side effects with this drug are kind of unique.
"We've got sedation, which is why it's just at bedtime."
"Interestingly, the lower end of the doses are more sedating than the higher end of the doses."
"So, 15 milligrams is actually more tiring than 45, but they should always all be dosed at bedtime."
"That's counter to justice,"
"I mean, that's counter to common sense!"
"Apparently Judge Deana McDonald isn't aware of the thing called the internet, where names like Will Frey and Austin Zehnder can be spread very very quickly."
"I would call the judge and defense attorneys behind these actions disgusting, but that wouldn't be an appropriate enough word."
So I'll use these words:
WlLL FREY AND AUSTlN ZEHNDER.
"Look, bottom line, in a world where half of rape victims don't say a word, we have a justice system that's encouraging girls to keep their mouth shut, at least one specific girl."
That's completely counter to what we need to have happen in this country.
"It's beyond offensive, it's freakin' wrong."
"So tell us what you think of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder,"
Judge Deana McDonald and defense attorneys Chris Klein and David Majia in the comments down below.

Tree rings are rich with history and can reveal the exact age and geographic origin of a tree trunk or a piece of wood.
"The scientific analysis of tree ring patterns is known as dendrochronology, and was used to learn more about the cabinet's wood."
Only certain types of wood can be analyzed with dendrochronology.
"In the case of the cabinet, the oak interior was most suitable."
"But the end grain of these oak panels, where the tree pattern is visible, was inaccessible."
"So to examine the hidden tree ring pattern of the interior, an innovative method of x-raying was devised."
"To begin, parts of the cabinet were carefully disassembled, transferred to the museum's x-ray laboratory and placed on a rotating table."
"For dendrochronology to be effective, the rings must be measured very accurately."
"Once the tree rings were perfectly aligned, the image was recorded on x-ray film."
"The tree rings were measured from this high resolution image and these results, along with many other samples, were analyzed by a dendrochronologist, who compared the tree ring measurements to weather patterns in different regions, going back in history."
"The dendrochronologist concluded that these oak panels came from a tree that grew in the region of Burgundy, in eastern France, and was cut down in 1574, six years before the cabinet was made."
Even the cabinet's smallest details had much to reveal about its origins.
"The middle drawer is lined with a silk and linen fabric, which is held in place by rose head tacks."
Scientific analysis could tell us whether these tacks are from the 16th century or are later reproductions.
"A loose, broken tack discovered inside the cabinet was prepared for analysis."
It was embedded in liquid resin that was hardened under blue light.
Are you using this?
"Well, Gwenyth Paltrow is,"
"Julianne Moore,"
"Charlize Theron, and, oh, Hilary Swank, yeah, they're using this product."
What it is is the Opal Eye Treatment.
You use it on the eyes.
It is amazing.
I use this--both of these--every day.
You can use this at morning and at night.
Morning and at night.
"This helps with fine lines, wrinkles, puffy eyes, which I get a lot, because I have allergies and a toddler, so sleep is a precious commodity that I always always get, so I must, must, must use this in dark circles."
"Oh, the dark circles, they-- I don't think they're ever going to go away."
"And the Clarisonic, this helps them as well, so to fight all of my problems, here for my beautiful skin, this will take it to the next level."
"So, again, if you're already using all of these amazing products that I hear, you say, ""I'm good."""
This is what you do to go to the next level.
"We've seen a number of techniques, some in previous lectures and some we talked about in this lecture."
"We've seen the Naive Bayes classifier, fairly in detail."
We've seen some Probabilistic Graphical
Models like Bayesian Networks.
"We've seen linear regression in detail, this time, we also heard about logistic regression neural networks and support vector machines, at least as to what they are."
"And, let's look at the problem and see which kind of techniques one would need to consider depending on the nature of the problem."
"We classify the problem in terms of the kind of features it has, whether they are numerical or categorical, that means numbers or classes."
"And the target variable, which is what we are trying to predict."
"We might be predicting a value, then it becomes a prediction problem where the value is numerical."
"We might be predicting a class in which, in which case it's a classification problem which is part of learning theory."
"Techniques can be used interchangeably across these two different types of prediction based on the kinds of features, of course, some techniques are more applicable than others."
"So, in the most straightforward case,"
"If we have numerical features and a numerical target we want to predict,"
"The correlation is stable and fairly linear, we'd use linear regression."
"Now, when I say stable and fair, fairly linear, even in situations like this,"
One would still prefer to use linear regression rather than some complicated non-linear function.
"Because using high order functions we'd, we'd say squares or cubes and sines and cos's, will tend to over fit the data and will not generalize to situations which may come up, arise in the future."
And then you only have one kid.
"If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now."
"Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans."
"Like, here is a graph of cow population."
And here is a graph of elephant population.
"Elephants, if you had just inserted yourselves in the human life like cows did you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies conspiring against the humans."
"And then you could have risen up and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant world, and elephant cars, and elephant planes."
"It would've been so great, but no...you gotta be pregnant for 22 months and just have one kid."
So annoying!
"Best wishes, John Green."
But back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred.
"Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records."
But they love to make guesses.
"Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture even though it was more work, or abundance gave people more leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility rite - or as some historians have argued - people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol."
"Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying:"
"""A wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise, old savage"""
"Off-topic: but in will know in the coming weeks, that the definitions of ""savage"" tends to be ""not me""."
"Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more."
"Like, early hunter/gatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted."
"And when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it."
Unless it is this food.
Then you want to do less of it.
I kind of wanna to spit it out.
That's much better.
"So, early farmers who would find the most successful forms of wheat and plant them, and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like,"
"""You know what would be awesome?"
"More food!"""
"Like, on this topic we have evidence that more than 13,000 years ago humans in Southern Greece were domesticating snails"
"In the Franchthi Cave there is a huge pile of snail shells, most of them are larger than current snail, suggesting that people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious."
"Snails make excellent domesticated food, by the way, because A, surprisingly nutritious, and B, they are easy to carry since they came in their own suitcases."
"And C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters."
That's not really a revolution.
[crowd laughing]
AYE.
It's approved.
[crowd cheers and claps]
"In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment may have had an effect."
"So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores."
"And then the other treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I seriously might do."
"After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about whether or not this will work."
I guess we'll just have to wait and see the results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning.
"Speaking of which, that's the dependent variable."
In the next lesson you'll learn how to formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOUGLAS CROCKFORD:
Thanks everybody for coming back for what turns out to be Scene 6:
Loopage [in the Crockford on JavaScript series].
"Before we begin, I recently read a white paper: some guys comparing two application platforms, one written in C++ and one written in Java."
"They went through the features, comparing them and deciding which of the platforms was better."
"When they got to garbage collection, they said garbage collection is a programmer convenience."
But then they evaluated the two systems based on how large a convenience it appeared to be.
"They measured the number of dispose instructions in the C++ code and found that there wasn't a lot of that, and then determined that it was more than a programmer convenience, which was completely wrong."
That's not what garbage collection is.
Garbage collection is a reliability mechanism.
Having garbage collection means you're not going to have dangling pointer errors and all these other hazards.
It also means there's a large class of wonderful algorithms that you can consider that are really too dangerous to consider if you don't have garbage collection.
So they completely screwed up their analysis.
"Basically their conclusion was: if you're into C++, you can feel good about not understanding Java."
That turns out to be a really bad way to think about things.
"You really should be making decisions based on good information and deep understanding, and very often that's not what we do."
But that's not what I'm going to be talking about tonight.
I'm going to be talking about loops.
Here's a loop statement.
"It says loop and you've got a block, and as you would expect, all of the statements within the block will get repeated over and over and over until something happens."
"JavaScript doesn't have a statement that looks quite like that, which"
"Oh, I made some new observation and I'm going to go straight to write a wiki article about it."
You can write about it but first you have to submit it to some say journals or conferences.
Go through the peer review process that is based on scientific merits and back and forth.
And then once it appears in some external link then you can write about that in the wiki entry. .
"The third of policy is abbreviated as NPOV, a neutral point of view."
"And unlike verifiability and no original research, neutral point of view is much harder to enforced, cuz it's not as."
Clear cut as to whether this policy is observed or not.
"But roughly speaking, it says that, if you read an article, you should not be able to tell."
What kind of people wrote it?
"For example, in U.S."
"Political articles, you should not be able to tell, is it a Democrat or a Republican who wrote this article?"
"So the article must appear as, as objective and neutral as possible to the point that you cannot easily identify the kinda label."
To the people who wrote this article.
There're also quite a few other mechanisms here including having a history page where a few people would click that page but you can always check that out.
Every single edit in the entire history of that hardcore is stored and you can check that for yourself.
There is also talk page for discussion among the contributors and the editors.
There is reputation system.
"If you enter using your ID then there's a reputation system of no ID, if you don't then there's a reputation system of the IP address."
"Later, in lecture thirteen we will talk about internet IP architecture but basically, this is the address of the device that you use to enter your articles."
And then there is a hierarchical community.
"There are many, many contributors."
And then there's a small set of people who are editors.
And then there is a even smaller subset of that who are more senior editors.
"And they form like, juries."
And they will debate and discuss and try to form rough consensus.
On articles where the contributors hold a very different opinions.
"And eventually, it can pop up to the highest level of committee to debate and discuss."
"So thanks to these policies and guidelines and thanks to these mechanisms, some of these challenges faced by Wikipedia has been quite successfully tackled."
"So now what we want to go into more detail is how this, this kind of committee operates."
And they operate it based on two kinds of mechanism.
"One is bargaining, and one is voting."
Prof:
"When Einstein introduced the wormhole into his equations... he didn't think that anyone... could ever walk through one of these things... because, after all, you die in the process."
"Impossible as it may sound, experts think there may be... a way to travel through a wormhole... and live to tell about it."
"In principle, you can go right through... to another parallel universe."
If you go through again... you wind up on yet another parallel universe.
And if you go again and again and again... you wind up on repeated parallel universes.
"It's like going into an elevator and hitting the ""up"" button."
Each floor looks like a universe.
"Once again, however, there is a major drawback."
One problem is you don't know where you're going to wind up.
You'll wind up in a middle of a star... wind up in the middle of a planet.
It may ultimately prove impossible for individuals... to pass through a portal to a parallel universe... but there may be another way to save humankind.
"If the gateway is very small, like, for example, atomic in size... perhaps what we should do is send a seed, a nanobot... a microscopic robot through the gateway... containing the DNA, containing all the information... necessary to create a new civilization on the other side of the universe."
Where do we see that in nature?
Think of a tree.
A tree creates a seed.
The seed contains the DNA that it shoots out in all directions... capable of creating a new tree.
"The idea is that if an advanced civilization... in the future could assemble enough high-energy laser beams... they could, in theory, burn a hole in the fabric of space-time."
It's very difficult.
But we physicists have calculated that if you concentrate... enormous energy at a single point... to attain something called the Planck energy... the ultimate energy... space and time itself become unstable.
Little bubbles begin to form...
little bubbles that are perhaps portals... gateways to another universe.
"In this way, a microscopic pod or nanobot... containing humanity's DNA and the cosmic code of our world... can be transported to a parallel universe."
Faced with extinction... this could be humanity's last great hope.
"If we can't do it, it means the death of the universe."
"But if this incredible feat is achieved... our entire universe would be resurrected... and, like a phoenix, rise from the ashes."
"In other words, you are playing God."
This fantastic idea...
like the replay button on the universal iPod... could reset the cosmic concerto of human history... back to the beginning.
At least some kinds almost certainly exist.
Maybe the other kinds exist as well.
We just don't know.
"Only then, perhaps, will we be certain that there are parallel universes."
And this machine lowers this building over the canal.
"And the water evaporates by the sun and condenses on the inside, and you get drinking water, desalinization, without expenditure of energy, using the sun."
"After we have filled this with salt water, it's for irrigation and flood control."
So all this water is directed towards water storage basins so you don't have flooding.
"Mr. Fresco sees a future where computer systems will monitor the world's environment and provide timely, accurate information on events that needs our immediate attention."
This represents the government of the future.
It would be cybernated.
"That means that computers will monitor farm production, harvest the crop, plant the seeds and maintain their packaging and everything else."
Whereas these various image screens will give you an image of any part of the Earth.
This represents a hurricane.
So you can see on these screens any area on Earth.
From 3000 miles out in space you can photograph plant diseases.
They show up as red.
"If you photograph the Amazon jungle, you will see a dark red area, which means those plants are ill or sick."
And so you can maintain with the satellite as the Earth rotates under the satellite.
You will be able to show people everything on Earth and every airplane in the air and every ship at sea.
"When you ask the computer, how many planes are there in the air at this instant?"
It will tell you exactly.
"It will tell you 10,408, 9, 10."
And you would be in touch with every area of the Earth by these screens.
There is no government in the future
The government is maintained electronically.
"But it is programmed to monitor food transportation, monitor the Earth, hurricanes, tsunamis, and tell people warning them of any problems."
So everyone will have this which gives them information about the Earth until we learn to control the tsunamis and the weather which i believe man will eventually be able to do.
"Man will eventually be able to control hurricanes, the weather and most disasters."
"Supreme Master Ching Hai has also spoken about the potential for wondrous technology to be available on our planet in the future, as in this excerpt from a July 2008 videoconference with Supreme Master Television staff in Los Angeles, California, USA."
"The technology that we are having right now is nothing, nothing compared to what we will have if all the population of the planet turn to a loving kind compassionate vegetarian diet."
"Then you will see all kind of inventions that we have never imagined before, will surface."
"And all people will live in peace and love, even if they don't pray for it."
It will come.
"Our sincere thanks Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows, for taking time to introduce The Venus Project and its underlying philosophy to us."
May a sustainable planet with everyone's needs met soon be a reality.
This shows the long-run expansion path for a firm.
"This shows how, as it produces different amounts of goods, it will choose different units of inputs."
"So for the first level of production, it chooses five machines and 10 workers."
"Then if it wants to double production, it chooses 10 machines and 20 workers."
"So if it wants to increase production by another 50%, it chooses 15 machines and 30 workers, and so on."
This is a linear expansion path.
"This says this firm is a production function, and prices are such that basically they always want these inputs in fixed proportions."
So it would be a fixed proportional expansion path.
"No matter how much you choose to produce, you always want to use twice as much labor as capital."
"However, that doesn't have to be the case."
So this long-run expansion path is going to be what becomes our underlying cost curve.
"This is where underlying cost curves are going to come from, and hopefully where supply is going to come from, is this"
long-run expansion path.
This long-run expansion path is going to show us how much more we have to spend to produce different amounts of quantity.
"Now in this case, what you see here is that you have these fixed proportions."
"That as you increase quantity, that the input portion stays the same, but that doesn't have to be."
"For instance, figure 9b, you can imagine a world where, as you produce more units, capital becomes less productive."
"So you want more and more labor, but not that much more capital."
So this might be the example of like McDonald's.
"If McDonald's wants to produce more burgers, ultimately there's only so many fryolators it can use."
"Ultimately, it needs more people to package up the burgers and sell them."
So you might think that capital becomes less and less productive.
"And as a given McDonald's franchise expands its sales, it might want to increase the ratio of labor to capital."
So this is a case where capital's becoming less productive.
"And as you see, as you expand production you're going to more labor and less capital."
"In other words, the marginal product of labor is still steep, and the marginal product of capital is flattening."
"So you want more and more labor, and not as much capital."
That's one kind of expansion path.
Figure 9c shows a different kind of expansion path.
Here's one where labor becomes less productive.
"So this might be, for example, something which is a mass production process, like producing automobiles."
"Where basically as you produce more and more automobiles, you need more and more machines to produce them."
Norms are defined as rules or standards that effect what's appropriate or inappropriate behavior in a group.
"Now, if any of you are teachers or have been teachers, you know, that you have to have order in your classroom and rules for students - what's appropriate and what's inappropriate."
"And even a parent does this in the family, which is actually a type of group."
It's more of a social group.
Kids have to know what is expected of them and when they're behaving appropriately and inappropriately.
"Well, norms keep things orderly."
They maintain respect.
"They make sure everybody has a chance to talk, makes sure that we don't take short cuts or discriminate against some one in some way or put somebody down."
"So, let's talk about norms."
"We're going to talk about two types of norms that are important, like the rules of the game or the ideal team."
"And now, these two types of norms, and this is actually something I am going to do is create my own categories for you just to make norms a little more analytic or make it a little more common sense."
I'm going to talk about process norms and relationship norms.
"First, let's talk about process norms."
"Now, process norms are rules about who can talk and what can they say when they're talking."
It's like turn-taking.
"Like what order are we going to take, and how are we going to make sure everybody gets to have some input?"
And let's not interrupt each other.
"Let's give everybody enough time, and let's listen and make sure that everybody gets a chance to say what should be said, and what shouldn't we say."
What's off limits?
What crosses the line into being something that's outside what this group really needs to be doing?
"Maybe it's confidential information, or maybe it's information about the past that's not relevant to what we're doing right now, staying on task for example."
That this is not on task.
This is a new issue; let's wait until later on that.
"It's a process norm, right there."
Now let's look at relationship norms.
"Now, relationship norms are about people."
Rules about treating each other in ways that are appropriate in a group.
It's about mostly respect.
"Listening and respecting each other and making sure we don't insult each other or condescend, even feel inferior in a group just to be on a mutual respect level that everybody is equally apart of the group and no one's better than anyone else."
Everybody is entitled to their opinions and no one's opinion is superior.
"That's one of the norms is a relational norm, and there are also norms about power."
What's appropriate use of power?
"Both of those are fighting against that continuous thing, the copying and the shuffling, and the inserting is there something about that flexibility of the rewiring that can kind of get us out of this some operations having to be slow because other operations are fast."
Question.
[Inaudible].
Yeah.
Why is space used for stacks when those are half?
Yeah.
"So in this case, right, depending on how you're modeling your stack, if it is with vectors, right, then you're likely to have the before and the after stack, both have capacity for everything, even when they're not used, right."
And so it's very
"likely that either right give 100 characters they're either on one stack or the other, but the other one might be kind of harboring the 100 spots for them when they come back."
"Or it could just be that you have the link list, which are allocating and de allocating but has the overhead of that."
"So it's likely that no matter which implementation the stack you have, you probably have about twice the storage that you need because of the two sides and the overhead that's kind of coming and going there."
So we will see the link list and we'll talk that guy through on
Friday.
I'll see you then.
"People are very, very aware of social feedback - like we're really tuned to this."
"And so things that can potentially harm your social standing can potentially impede your relationships with other people, these are things that we take very seriously."
"When we're sitting there in the context of that situation, we don't always respond like we should."
Now
I will put ECG sensors on you.
"We wanted to look at just how do people respond to social stress and we wanted to know how they respond physiologically to it, how they responded cognitively and how they respond subjectively."
"At the outset of the experiment, the first thing that people are doing is that we want to collect these baseline recordings of physiology."
To do that we need to affix these physiological sensors that monitor activity.
And so here is the ECG signal coming in.
What we're doing is looking at changes from their normal state.
"This is the skin temperature, and you see right here it's at 93.42 degrees."
So they were told to think about stress as a coping tool.
"Like, stress isn't bad, that these responses have evolved to help our ancestors survive, that if we didn't have these things we'd be doing worse."
So after this we tell them they're going to give a speech about their strengths and weaknesses.
"Ok, we are ready to begin."
Please tell us about your strengths and weaknesses as a person.
We will be evaluating your performance throughout the speech.
This is a very self-relevant speech.
It's bringing it down into the soil.
It gets processed and de-nitrified and goes back up as
N_2.
There's some industrial fixation; the Bosch-Haber process is doing that.
"This runs off, gets into the ocean and fertilizes the ocean."
"If we look at the impact of nitrate and sulfate on human problems and on terrestrial ecosystems, one of the big ones is acid precipitation."
"So this stuff right here, all of human industry and cars and so forth, which in the United States has been concentrated in an area mostly roughly between Chicago and Pennsylvania, right here, this area, because of the-- remember our Hadley cells and the jet stream and the reason that the air is flowing from west to east across the continent-- all of that emission is getting picked up and it's getting dropped on lakes in Canada and the Northeastern United States."
"So in 1955 the pH in this region of the country, in freshwater bodies, had dropped to 4.6; that's starting to get pretty acid."
And by the way it was a much bigger problem for a lake that was sitting on granite than for a lake that was sitting on
limestone.
Why would it be more of a problem on granite than on
limestone?
Student:
Limestone's basic.
Prof:
Limestone's basic.
It's also a buffer.
So limestone will basically put a lot of carbonate into the water and buffer this.
"So this was a big problem, and in fact some lakes were"
losing all of their fish populations.
"However, there were improvements in air quality control around the country, and this has spread, but in many places it's also been ameliorated."
"I'd say it still remains a serious problem, and it's a situation that also causes international tensions, because basically Eastern Canada is getting hammered by"
"U.S. industrial and car emissions, because the flow of materials around the planet does not respect the arbitrary national boundaries that humans have created."
It's even worse in Europe.
"In Europe the industrial production of Germany, which creates a huge load of acid in the atmosphere, gets dumped on Scandinavia, which is old Scandinavian basalt shield; so they don't really have any"
limestone buffer up there in Scandinavia.
And that's one of the issues that gets talked a lot about in the European Union is how to equalize these kinds of costs.
"Because basically Canada is being treated as an externality by the United States, and Scandinavia is being treated as an externality by Germany."
So that sort of thing needs conflict resolution.
"Okay, water."
"The hydrological cycle is critical because you can't grow plants without water, and you can't grow humans without water either."
"And as the human population has gone up over five, and now through six billion, fresh water on the planet is becoming very, very scarce."
"And of course as soon as you bring a node into the set X, into the [inaudible] territory, you have to commit or Dijkstra's algorithm chooses to commit to a shortest path distance and a shortest path."
"What is the definition of its shortest path distance, as computed by"
Djikstra?
Well it's just a degree score.
"So it's going to assign the vertex t the shortest path distance of minus two, and the path is going to be just the arc S t."
But notice that this is in fact wrong.
"The shortest path distance from S to t is not minus two, in this graph."
"There is another path, namely the one that goes thorough V that has length minus four, less than minus two."
"So, [inaudible] computes incorrect shortest path distances on this trivial 3-note graph."
"So t o summarize the story so far, We've described Dijkstra's algorithm."
I've shown you that it works in a very simple example that doesn't have negative edge lines and I've showed you that it doesn't work in and even simpler example that does have negative edge
lines.
"So, I've both given you some plausibility that it might work generally at least for non negative edges links."
But I've also tried to sew some seeds of doubt that it's not an all clear if at this point if Dijkstra's algorithm is always clear correct or not even if you have non-negative edge lengths and certainly if it is always correct there better be a fool proof argument to why.
You should be demanding and explanation of a claim If Dijkstra's is correct in any kind of generality.
That's the subject of the next video.
Now let's find the sum of squares for within subject variability.
This one's a
little harder.
We take the sum of each value and subtract the respective mean.
Then square it.
Then we add them all together.
This is a little trickier.
You need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respected mean.
Square them and then add them all up.
Do the same for every sample.
And then add up each sum of squares.
"You're welcome to enter your calculations here, but that part won't be graded."
Only the complete sum of squares for within groups will be graded.
"There are many people who experience discrimination in healthcare here in Oregon, but members of our transgender communities face healthcare discrimination at a systemic and unparalleled level."
"As the mayor mentioned, the American Medical Association has identified transgender health care as being medically necessary."
"Yet many transgender Oregonians are routinely denied the ability to even purchase health insurance, or are denied the coverage for basic medically necessary care solely on the basis of their gender identity."
It ran in linear time.
It gave us shortest paths.
It gave us connected components.
Why do we need to do anything else?
"Well, it turns out depth first search has its own impressive catalog of applications, some of which you cannot get using breadth first search."
"So, what I'm gonna show you in this video is about computing the topological ordering of a directed graph."
Both of the applications we're gonna discuss are in directed graphs.
The simple one is topological ordering.
This just means you sequence nodes of the directed acyclic graph so that all the arcs go forward.
So you might be wondering you know why bother with another graph search strategy.
After all we have breadth-first search which seems pretty awesome right?
It runs in linear time.
It's guaranteed to find everything you might wanna find.
It computes shortest paths.
It computes connected components if you imbed it in a for loop.
Kinda seems like what else would you want?
"Well, it turns out depth-first search is gonna have its own impressive catalog of applications which you can't necessarily replicate with breadth-first search."
And I'm gonna focus on applications in directed graphs.
So there's gonna be a simple one that we discuss in this video.
And then there's gonna be a more complicated one that has a separate video devoted to it.
"So in this video, we're gonna be discussing computing topological orderings of directed acyclic graphs."
"That is, directed graphs that have no directed cycle."
The more complicated application is computing strongly connected components in directed graphs.
The run time will be essentially the same as it was for breadth-first search and the best we could hope for which is linear time.
"And again, we're not assuming that there's necessarily that many edges."
There may be much fewer edges than vertices.
"So, linear time in these connectivity applications means O of M plus N. So let's now talk about the actual code of depth-first search."
There's a couple ways to do it.
One way to do it is to just make some minor modifications to the code for breadth-first search.
"The primary difference being instead of using a queue at its first in, first out behavior, you swap in a stack where it's last in, first out behavior."
"Again, if you don't know what a stack is you should read about that in the programming textbook or on the web."
It's something that supports constant-time insertions to the front and constant time deletions from the front unlike a queue which is meant to support constant-time deletions to the back.
Sorry.
"As Baby Boomers start to enter social security age, claiming strategies have been a popular topic."
"The decision can, can be both emotional and rational."
"The emotional decision is about getting your money now, so you can retire."
"The rational decision is whether you should, will you need insurance payments down the line or not."
"If you're worried about the amount of money, you will have at retirement, you should wait."
"If not, you should direct your decision toward the best chance of getting the largest total amount."
There are calculators available for this.
Many financial planners actually specialize in this strategy.
"As an eligible person can start ret, start their benefits as early as, as an, an eligible person, I'm sorry, can start the benefits as early as age 62 years of age."
"However, the benefit will permanately be reduced by the formula indicated above."
"For early Baby Boomers, starting benefits at age 62, will reduce their benefit by 20%."
For later Baby Boomers the benefits will reduce by 25%.
Delaying retirment by a full year.
"By a year, full, I'm sorry."
"Delaying retirement by a year beyond full retirement age, increases the benefit by 8% each year up to age 70."
This is a straight 8% increase for each year.
And is not a compounded benefit of 8%.
All of these increases and decreases are figured on a monthly basis.
From[unknown] point of view it does not matter when you take your benefits.
"The deduction is calculated as such that the break point, point, the break even point for various choices is approximately average life expectancy."
"Choosing an early, choosing early or choosing late does not matter to the system it only matters to the individual."
Here's a good time to be reminded that
Social Security is an insurance against poverty at an old age.
If you are lucky enough to live to a very old age it may be the only thing left for you.
"Thus, taking benefits early is a risky choice when considering the rate at which longevity is increasing."
"As a nod to the homemaker, so prevalent in the early years of social security nonworking spouses or spouses with low, significantly lower wage bases than higher earning spouses."
Can receive up to 50% of the higher earning spouse's benefit.
The spouse's total benefit is a combination of the lower earning spouse's own benefit and the spousal benefit to make up the difference.
"However, the higher earning spouse must have to filed, must have filed for, I am sorry the higher earning spouse must have filed for benefits in order for the spouse to receive a spousal benefit."
And if the lower earning spouse is less than his or her retirement age.
Full retirement age.
"There is a study called the PREDlMED study that looked at 722 asymptomatic persons, who were age 55 to 80, who were at high cardiovascular disease risk."
"They were randomized to be in a group that ate either a low-fat diet, or one or two of, or one of two different types of Mediterranean diets."
"At the three month follow-up period, the weight and the BMI were the same in the three groups."
"But there were lower blood sugar levels, lower systolic blood pressure levels, lower total cholesterol to HDL ratios in the individuals that were in the two"
Mediterranean Diet groups than you saw in the people that were in the low fat group.
"Also, inflammation markers were lowered in those were who were following the two"
Mediterranean diets.
"And because there is a role of inflammation in heart disease, that's another reason why researchers think that this diet might be beneficial in protecting against heart disease."
"What about the effect of the Mediterranean diet on, Metabolic Syndrome."
"Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of factors and it looks at how an individual's waist circumference their HDL level, triglycerides, blood pressure and glucose metabolism interface."
And for individuals that have the
"Metabolic Syndrome, practitioners believe that they're are at higher risk, for developing other sorts of chronic disease."
"In 2011, researchers did a meta-analysis of 50, of 50 different studies, that had over 500,000 people."
And they wanted to study the effect of the Mediterranean diet on metabolic syndrome and its components.
"They found that adhering to the Mediterranean diet, was found to be highly protective against the development of metabolic syndrome."
"So much so, that they were able to show a 31% reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome for individuals who stuck to the principles of the Mediterranean diet."
"If you're interested in learning more, take a look at some of these resources."
"And, in particular, the Oldways site that explains in pretty good detail."
The history of the
Mediterranean Diet as well as some of the existing research about it's effectiveness in helping to prevent heart disease.
Dornheigm a small village in Thüringia
With a pretty little church
A church where once of Europe's most famous musicians have walked down the aisle
On 17 October 1707 JSB married his first wife in this church
The church is a ... attracting people from all over the world
It's group of supporters comprises 190 members from Germany Switzerland Italy Netherland USA and Japan.
We are very happy to have not only the ...
So it is no wonder that couples still come here to get married
The church could well have decayed too.
In the former GDR
There was a lack of money to preserv it and perhaps a lack of interest on the part of the government
The building decayed.
"Is it finished?"""
Something made the whole thing actually plausible somehow.
We got away with it.
I remember coming offstage and being like:
"""I think that actually went alright."""

Prof:
"Okay everybody, let's start in."
"Today I want to talk about green building and the opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building, and also the energy implications of green building standards."
"And I'd like to also address the history by having you think about the way that these standards have evolved over time, particularly the evolution of certification programs."
"So the idea of certification, I want you to think about it quite broadly at the outset."
Because it basically implies that certain standards are being applied to something.
"It might be a product, it could be a service."
"It could be a neighborhood, a city."
"So that the idea that there is an expert group that would review something, whether or not it's your academic preparation and performance, or whether or not it's a building's performance, and then certify it, give it a symbol."
It would rank it relative to others.
One obvious example would be looking at a GPA on a transcript.
"Well, what we'll see after today's lecture is that the green building programs that have evolved in Europe, in the United States, and Australia, they really are based on that same kind of concept."
So how would you rate the environmental and health responsibility and energy efficiency of new building standards?
How would they apply or how might they apply to renovation projects?
So I'm basically going to use the lecture today to share with you an overview of a paper that will be published in about two weeks that is a critique of the U.S.
Green Building Council's program known as LEED.
So I'd like you also think about the importance of the building sector in its demand for energy in the United States.
Buildings consume seventy-six percent of the U.S. electricity and emit almost half of the nation's greenhouse gases.
So that how we manage the future of building and development will very much influence the intensity of energy demand.
"Keep in mind also that the U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, and U.S. consumers consume nearly twenty-five percent of the world's energy and only accounts for five percent of the world's population."
So that our energy demand is increasing at about two percent per year.
So why might that be?
"I mean, obviously, we're changing our behavior."
We're changing our technology and our dependence on technology.
"And also the environments that we shape around us have enormous implications for energy that often are not well understood, for a variety of reasons."
"Right now, Governor Snyder is pushing a bill that would give himself,"
"Governor Snyder and his administration, the power to declare any town or school district to be in a financial emergency."
"If a town was declared by the governor and his administration to be in a financial emergency, they would get to put somebody in charge of that town."
"And they want to give that emergency manager they've just put in charge of the town, the power to ""reject, modify or terminate"" any contracts the town may have entered into."
Including any collective bargaining agreement.
"So this emergency person, who get's put in charge of a town deemed to be in financial crisis, by the governor's administration."
This emergency person gets to strip the town of union rights.
"Unilaterally, by their own personal authority."
"But this emergency person also gets the power, under this bill, to suspend or dismiss, elected officials!"
Think about that for a second.
Doesn't matter who you voted for in Michigan.
"Doesn't matter who you elected, you're elected local government can be dismissed, at will."
"The emergency person, sent in by the Rick Snyder administration, could recommend that a school district be absorbed into another school district."
"That emergency person is also granted power specifically to dis-incorporate or dissolve, entire city governments."
What year was your town founded?
"Does it say so, like on the town border, as you drive into your town?"
Does it say what year your town was founded?
What did your town's founding fathers and founding mothers have to go through in order to incorporate your town?
"Republicans in Michigan want to be able to unilaterally abolish your town, and dis-incorporate it - regardless of what you, as a resident of that town, think about it."
"You don't even have the right to express an opinion about it, through your locally elected officials, who represent you."
"Because the Republicans in Michigan say they reserve the right to dismiss your measly elected officials, and to do what they want instead, because they know best."
"The version of this bill that passed the Republican controlled Michigan House, said it was fine for this emergency power, to declare a fiscal emergency."
Invoking all of these extreme powers.
It was fine for that power to be held by a corporation.
"So ? of Michigan, could at the governor's disposal, be handed over to the discretion of a company."
You still want your town to exist?
Take it up with the board of directors of this corporation that will be overseeing your future now.
"Or rather, don't take it up with them, frankly their not interested."
"Instead of thinking of Michigan as the Upper and Lower Penninsula,"
"let's just consider the prospect of Amway-stan, right?"
The area between Pontiac and Flint?
"Could be the next Dow Chemical-ville, maybe?"
"We are seeing clinical reports of weight gain in patients, so that could be an issue."
"There is a potential for some urinary retention, so keep that in mind with patients."
"There are some drug interactions to be aware of, but not necessarily limiting treatment options, as talked about with some of the other agents."
"The next dual-action agent is an NDRl, or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor."
And this is unique because it's not touching anything related to serotonin.
So this is a different shift from what we've talked about.
We're increasing dopamine and norepinephrine.
"You have to remind yourself, too, that all of these increases, when you touch one neurotransmitter directly, you will indirectly increase all of them."
So this is a direct increase of dopamine and norepinephrine.
Not to say that eventually the patient may get some serotonin effect also.
So the one agent is Buproprion.
We have a lot of formulations of this drug:
"Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL."
"We have also an agent called Zyban, which is Buproprion, and it's indicated for nicotine addiction, so that's a smoking cessation agent."
"So you have to be careful if you have a patient already taking this drug for smoking cessation, then we don't want to add it on for depression."
Your dosing is anywhere from 75-450mg a day.
"And it's going to be in divided doses, depending on the agent you use."
And we'll kind of show you that on the next slide.
This drug is very activating.
"So, if you're on a formulation that needs to be taken three times a day, don't have the patient taking it past dinner time."
"If you have a patient taking this at bedtime, most likely next month they'll need some sort of sleeping agent because they're going to have trouble falling asleep."
"They're going to have restlessness, insomnia - often people just feel like they're crawling out of their skin."
There is absolutely no sexual side effect with this medication because there's no serotonin activity.
This agent can also be used for patients who have a decrease in sex drive while taking a [inaudible] other antidepressant that affects serotonin.
So you can add this in.
There are a few contraindications.
"Anyone... per the packaging, and that's with a seizure disorder and eating disorder."
A little history on that:
"The reason that this was contraindicated in seizure patients and in eating disorder patients is because it was studied in very high doses in bulimic patients, and that small subset of patients had an increased risk of head seizures, so, it's kindof followed the drug along throughout its history."
"And again, we talked about patients on Zyban for smoking cessation already."
It's the same medication.
"So, the different agents we have are immediate release, sustained release, and extra-long acting, I guess you could call it."
Well it turns out that free here does not mean the pricing is nothing.
"There is also implicit pricing, that is the amount of impact one can have."
So you can call that fame.
You can call that influential power.
"Basically those who contribute to Wikipedia believe that their reward, even though not financial, can be immense."
"In their articles and writing's might be read by tens of millions of people, might be quoted in various other articles and give them a very big sense of satisfaction and accomplishment."
So that is one reason why many people contribute a lot.
"There's also a very strong positive narrow effect, this N squared effect, which is mentioned, 'kay?"
As more people start to read a certain article.
It provides even more incentive for people to contribute cuz they know the audience is very big.
So the difficult part of Wikipedia is at the very beginning around 2001 to 2002 when you didn't have as many audience.
"When people realized that googling the term usually returns Wiki article within the top three entries, then people will have, have much larger incent, big incentive to contribute."
"We'll later in the next lecture look at the different trajectories of growth of popularity of a certain product and services and how the now, if that place in shaping that curve."
"The second challenge is that, is open to anyone."
Including those who are not experts.
"Non experts, including even those who are anonymous."
"And the saving grace for solving this problem is check and balance While you can write anything arbitrary, but probably within a few seconds, it will be corrected by somebody else."
So having a large pool of community is very important to provide the checks and balance features.
The third one is open to any subject.
"Including those that are sensitive, in terms of religion or political or other social subjects."
So there must be some guidelines and rules and some mechanism to enable a meaningful writing process and editing process for these subjects.
So what are the policy and guidelines?
"There are three key policies, and quite a few other guidelines, we'll just work through the top three policies here."
"One policy in Wikipedia is abbreviated as V, stands for verifiability."
"And this can be implemented in mechanism, which is external link."
You cannot just claim something is true on a weekend article.
"If you want to contribute article or an article with something new, you have to provide way for people to verify it."
"If it cannot be forcified or validated, it that it cannot be stated."
"Another policy is abbreviated as NOR, No"
"Original Research, because this is encyclopedia."
It's not a peer reviewed journal article.
"So you cannot say, I, invented a new, theorem, or new law."
That's quite a lot.
In fact 18% is quite a lot.
And this has to do with the fact that in this assessment we took into account all the changes in land use that are related to
"livestock, the production of animals in terms of methane, the manure management in terms of also methane and nitrous oxides and the various steps of the feed production, livestock production, processing, transport and so on that have to do with livestock and feed commodities and this is how you get to 18%."
OK.
How did you respond yourself when you were confronted with these figures?
I knew it was high.
I knew also the impact on water and biodiversity was going to be very significant.
"I didn't expect it to be quite as high, but this is the figure we came up with."
And what do you think?
What was the most shocking amazing conclusion from your report?
"Well, I think one of the issues is that this huge environmental impact that"
"livestock has is not well understood by the public, and not even well-understood by the farmers themselves."
So there is actually a strong case for regulating the livestock sector much more than is currently the case.
Thank you.
Everyone is talking about global warming and trying to find out why its happening.
But how can it be that livestock farming is hardly ever mentioned as one of its causes?
Certainly when more and more scientists have made the link between livestock farming and climate change.
"It's not generally known, but between 40 and 50 % of cereals are not eaten by humans, but by livestock."
"And for soy, that's about 75%."
"If you consider that it takes about 7 kg of grain - that's corn and soya beans - to make just one kilogramme of beef, we are talking about hundreds and hundreds of hectares of soya bean planted in former rainforest to provide meat."
That's not a very efficient way of producing protein food.
The soya beans imported come from places like Brazil.
"Brazil has the biggest soy export market in the world, and there soy production has grown since the 1960s something like 57 times."
So they're just producing more soy than ever before.
"And most of that soy is being produced in very environmentally sensitive areas, including the Amazon rainforest, and the Cerrado, which is woodland savannah."
What can I say?
It's a disaster.
"The main drawback is losing biodiversity, but indirectly it's also influencing climate change."
It's speeding up the climate change that's already occurring.
"Carbon sinks are places in the world, like the rainforest or the Cerrado, some agricultural lands that soak up and sequester carbon, and when those are lost, we are losing a very important tool in the fight against global warming."
Today there is nothing more important than trying to contain the problem of global warming.

Hi!
"I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village and today we are going to show you how to clean and prepare, for cleaning actually, a leek."
"Leeks are great to use in all kinds of stocks; usually seafood stocks, chicken stock, vegetable stock, they are a great addition."
"At first glance, you notice the similarity to green onions essentially."
The green onions and chives that usually come from this will come from the top of the leaves as well as the base.
"As you know from a green onion, its a much more dense and compacted along the stalk here and a little less on the leaves."
"So with leek, we just kind of want to take off those leaves."
So I'm just going to make a cut with my utility knife here and takes these guys off; move those.
"On the base, I don't want to cut too high up this direction above the roots simply because it will pull it apart."
So I am going to get as close to the base as I can still leaving everything connected.
"That way, remove that."
"What I like to do is cut these in half at this point, straight down the center."
"That way we can rinse the inside as well as the base and as we cut this direction, we get some nice little half circles that come off of the leek here and they are nice and uniformed."
"I'll come back in just a second, rinse these guys and show you what kind of cuts we can get out of these."
"You don't get better, just you accelerate your chakras and this is not a healthy condition, actually it's a condition of instability,"
It's a back and forth.
Be healthy and happy is to maintain the continuity of our energy linearity.
This is healthy!
"But for this we must ""be""."
"It's not a matter of controlling,"
"It's not a matter of saying you'll learn a technique and do it, because it does not work that way."
"So we're talking about energy and energy is a fundamental process, it's fundamental."
"It's everywhere, whether we believe it or not, there is no place that is empty."
There will always be energy.
"The composition of the universe or the universes, or everything that exists, is energetic."
And we are immersed in those energies.
"Depending on our thoughts, on how we are, we can make this energy better or worse."
"So, you catch this energy through the chakras all the time."
We can't create excuses like this:
"""Now I'll get energy."""
"No, you're receiving all the time."
"If you are in a place with purest and immanent energy you will feel very well, will feel happy, you will feel energized."
"In fact, this thing of feeling energized, I'll explain it: dense energies have a much slower circulation within us, that's why when you are feeling bad, feeling sick it's because the circulation of this energy is not happening."
"Then you go to a place with plenty immanent energy and stay there under a tree, a very good place, away from people, because people produce emotional energy, then you may say:"
"""Wow!"
"I'm recovered! """
"Of course you're recovered, you just consumed much more subtle energy, which circulates much faster in your energetic body and after all, when you realize, you're revitalized."
"So, know and understand energy is a very important thing."
Dense energies are produced in the lower chakras and subtler energies are those produced in the higher chakras.
"So, lower chakras: there is the spleen, the umbilical, the sex chakra, the hepatic chakra, these are the energies that transiting these chakras."
"The energy that would be average, i.e. not emotional, and not subtle, is that which is in the lower frequencies of the heart chakra."
These frequencies exist in the heart chakra because every chakra is connected with previous and next chakra.
"So, to make a connection with the previous chakra, which is emotional, you must have similar frequencies."
"Result: when you feel palpitations, or your heart is beating very fast due to an emotion,"
It's because the emotional chakras have contaminated the heart chakra at it's lowest part.
"Now, in the upper part the frequencies of heart chakra are stable, they are connected to the next chakra that would be the laryngeal chakra."
Some of these errors have dramatic consequences and cause severe diseases.
"The investigation of these errors also permits the reconstruction of genealogies, in humans as well as in animals, thus tracking back the evolutionary history of species."
"DNA forms the chromosomes, contained in the cell nucleus."
"A second genome, maybe some of you didn't know, is in the mitochondria, organelles devoted to the production of energy."
Mitochondrial DNA has a number of interesting features.
"Among these is its mode of transmission, only along the maternal lineage, from mother to progeny."
"Hence, the investigation of mitochondrial DNA variants permits to reconstruct the ""female history"" of species."
Let's go back to bovine.
When did the history of domestic cattle start?
"At the onset of agriculture, about 10,000 years ago."
"Agriculture marked the beginning of a new era, the Neolithic, and represented a fundamental step in the evolution of modern society by fostering the conversion of hunter-gatherers into farmers."
Farmers created stable settlements.
"Stability and food availability permitted a demographic expansion of human populations and their stratification in classes, most having occupations other than food hunting, seed of complex modern societies."
Archaeological and archaeobiological records indicate the existence of two and perhaps four sites of cattle domestication.
"The most ancient site is in the Fertile Crescent, dated about 8,500 years BC, in an area at the border of Iran, Iraq and Turkey."
"Here the wild ancestor Bos primigenius, a very dangerous animal of extraordinary strength, got domesticated as Bos Taurus, the European type cattle we see in our farms."
Another very important site is Pakistan.
"The first evidences date back to 7,000 years BC in the Indo Valley, where they domesticated ""Bos Indicus"", the zebu, the humped cattle now widely spread in South Asia and Africa."
"Two other possible domestication sites,"
"North Africa and Far East Asia, are still under debate."
What information on domestication is contained in cattle mitochondrial DNA?
"The coloured spheres you see here represent animals, grouped in geographic areas: you can see a geographic map and group of spheres in different areas:"
"South West Asia, Anatolia, Central Europe, Africa, etc."
You also see colours.
A given colour represents groups of animals having similar mitochondrial DNA sequence.
Different colours indicate animals with different mitochondrial sequences.
Colours indicate genealogies.
"The reds are a large family, the yellows another large family and so on."
"Branches of spheres are present within colours, indicating the existence of variants also within genealogies, the wider the branching, the greater the variability in mitochondrial DNA sequences within a family."
How can these pattern be interpreted?
In Anatolia and South-West Asia the genetic variability is higher than in Europe and Africa.
You may see the presence of all colours and wide branching here.
A simple example of that is if we have x=x*0.
"So that can be replaced by the assignment, x=0, And again, we have, we still have a statement here."
We still have to execute a statement.
"But This statement may execute more quickly because it doesn't involve actually running the, the, the times operator."
"It doesn't involve referencing the value of X. Presumably X is registered, that doesn't really cost anything."
"But you know, it's possible that this instruction over here will execute faster than this instruction over here."
"Now, on many machines that's not the case."
"In fact, this assignment of this, this assignment on the right will take the same amount of time as the multiplication on the left, but as we will see."
"Having a assignment of a constant to a variable will actually enable other optimization, so this is still a very worthwhile transformation to do."
"An example that's almost certainly an optimization is replacing, the exponentiation operator,"
Raising a value to the power of two by an explicit multiply.
"So here, we're computing y^2, And over here, we just replace that by y*y."
Why is this a good idea?
Well this explanation operator here is almost certain not a built in machine instructions.
Probably this is gonna wind in our generated code being a call into to some built in math library.
And there will involve a functioning call overhead.
And then there will be some kind of general loop in there to do the right number of multiplies.
Depending on what the exponent is.
So in the special case where we know that the exponent is two.
"It's much, much more efficient."
"To just replace that, call to [inaudible] by an explicit multiply."
"Another example of, substituting one kind of operation for another, In a in a special situation, Is if we have, a multiplication by a power of two."
"We can replace that by a left bit shift, So here, multiplying by eight."
"That's the same as shifting the, binary representation of x over by three bits, And, I and, That will, you know, in fact compute the same thing."
And it doesn't even have to be a power of two.
"If we had a [inaudible] location by some other number that is not a power of two, that can be replaced by some combination of shifting and, and subtractions."
Okay?
"So we can replace the multiply by some combination of shifts and, and arithmetic operations, Simpler arithmetic operations."
"Now these last two here I should point out, you know, these are interesting transformations."
On modern machines generally this will not result in any kind of speed-up because on modern machines the integer multiply operation is just as fast as any other single instruction.
"Now, on historical machines these were actually significant optimizations."
"So all of these, instructions together are examples of algebraic simplifications."
"We might test that the mean is zero versus the alternative, that the mean is greater than zero or the mean is less than zero."
And again this could be useful as a screening device.
Because assets that have means that are positive are assets that are giving or making money.
Assets that have negative means are assets that are losing money.
And so if you're constucting a portfolio you wanna go long the assets that are making money and go short the assets that are losing money for example.
"So you can use, use hypothesis testing as a screening device in that context."
"And then similarly, you know, the screen device for assets that are you know, good diversifiers in a portfolio, could be correlation of zero versus the correlation is positive or, or negative."
Another kind of hypothesis test is a test about one of the assumptions of the model.
"So, in the constant expected return model, the asset returns are assumed to be normally distributed."
"And we've done a lot of descriptive statistics to, get a feeling for how good that assumption is."
Right?
"We looked at histograms, we looked at Q-Q plots."
"Now, we would like to have a rigorous test of this hypothesis, so we're gonna say, are the returns normal or not?"
Well we need to make a decision.
All right?
And so we would like to be able to test the hypothesis that returns are normal versus the alternative that they are not normal.
Okay.
So why is this important?
Well.
"One of the reasons, well, when you assume a distribution for returns, that dictates, for example, how you compute value at risk on your asset."
"So if I assume returns are normally distributed, then I compute value at risk based on the quantile of a normal distribution."
Okay?
"If the normal distribution's not appropriate, then I should be using some other quantile estimate, to compute value at risk."
"So, you know, again, we could, value at risk is an interesting risk metric."
And how we compute it depends upon assumptions of our model.
"And so if we want to use the formula for normal value at risk, then we should test the hypothesis to see if the normal distribution is appropriate before we use that technique."
So that's a reason here.
And then also in portfolio theory we have the underlying assumption that returns are essentially multivariate normally distributed.
And if that assumption is broadly not very good then we should perhaps look at an alternative way of creating portfolios rather than using the traditional portfolio analysis.
"And so that's, that's another reason."
"Now, another kind of test it, is based on another assumption of the model."
In our constant expect to return model we expect assets are uncorrelated over time.
The quantum principle that creates many versions of each person... can also create entire universes.
"The universe, at one point, was actually smaller than an electron."
If that's true and if electrons are described... by being many places at the same time in parallel states... this means that the universe also exists in parallel states.
You inevitably get parallel universes.
There's no choice.
But that's not all.
Scientists recently have shocked the world again... and claimed that there could be one more kind of parallel universe.
These level-four type are created... either by quantum fluctuations or by branes clashing.
What is created is radically different.
"In this type of parallel universe, all the rules are out the window."
"It could be, in fact... that the mathematics and physics describing reality... differs from what we're used to in our universe."
If the laws of physics are different in a level-four parallel universe... space could just consist of gas and particles.
"Galaxies, stars, and planets would not have formed... and life as we know it would not exist."
To show that any type of parallel universe...
"level one, two, three or four, truly exists... experts must find the evidence."
"Be they big, tiny or invisible... scientists must find physical indications... of the extra dimensions... that supposedly connect us to these other worlds."
"To do it, today physicists at Fermilab in illinois... are conducting extraordinary experiments... hoping to prove that any kind... even the wildest type of parallel universe, is really out there."
"For the first time ever, real and remarkable experiments... are taking place at particle colliders like the Tevatron at Fermilab."
"Right now, this detector is looking for evidence... of extra dimensions."
If there are extra dimensions of a certain size and shape... this experiment will find them.
Their best chance of exposing extra dimensions... comes from smashing microscopic particles together... at super speeds.
The smoking gun in the hunt is gravity.
It has been found to be a uniquely weak force... so the Fermilab physicists are looking for the particle that carries gravity.
It is called a graviton.
It's the particle that carries gravity... which we think knows about all of the extra dimensions of space.
So we think the gravitons... if you can produce them in high energies... should actually move off into the extra dimensions.
"But finding a graviton, or at least a sign of one... is a huge challenge."
It's tricky and complicated because you're looking for nothing.
You're looking for something that has disappeared.
What's the rate now?
"It's very, very rare that you make a really exotic particle."
So we literally have to collide them billions of times... in order to find the very rare event... where you make something like a particle... that disappears into extra dimensions.

"After long hard years of work and study, you've made it!"
This is your day of triumph; this is your day of joy.
All of us join in your celebration today.
You graduate into a world of accelerating change.
Do not fear this world.
You are unusually well prepared for it.
You possess unusually refined senses of self reliance and creativity.
That is the Rochester way.
"Go forth with confidence and pride in your accomplishment, knowing that your faculty and all who have had a role nourishing your intellectual growth here are immensely proud of you."

"To my fellow members of the class of 2012, thank you."
It has been an honor being a peer amongst you all as we learned and grew together over the past four years.
"While we've all taken different paths to get to today's ceremony, it's also true that we have had many experiences together that unite our class."
"Remember the experiences we have had together: the painted tunnels, your freshmen hall, your sports victories... for these are our roots."
"But also feel empowered to move your life to the next level, for this is not the end and simply just the beginning."
I grew up in a different time and context where freedom was limited and gender roles were greatly constrained.
"Indeed, my childhood was dominated by a lack of options, in a culture that made clear everyday that I was to be forever constrained by race, gender, and poverty."
I was told that I could not not aspire to a profession.
"That I was not deserving of excellence in education, but few who espouse such views understood that a movement was taking hold that would change this reality."
"For example, women today increasingly hold positions of prominence, choice, and parity."
And that progress and that progress while not complete is still improving.
The gender balance in this graduating is proof that women rock.
"So today graduates, you have an immense and welcome burden of choice that many, in previous eras, lacked."
"I exhort you to live up to the community principle so clearly articulated in this university's mission statement if your education has served you well, you will not shed its principles when you toss your hats into the air and return your academic robes."
Your education places a heavy burden upon you to use your knowledge to benefit society.
"May you live with joyful discovery, challenging dilemmas, and uplifting choices that build your confidence in the blessings in life, liberty, and human dignity."
May your highest aspiration be to live consonant with the sacred trust you hold as an educated person to defend and advance the common good.
"Congratulations to you all, and god speed."

"This is not formal guidance, but it's provided as tips for how agencies can deal with legacy content on shared drives."
And also think about day-forward planning procedures for the proper management of shared drives.
I've emphasized that these best practices and tips can be used for that cleanup process before records are moved to an electronic record-keeping system that may be able to automate many of these responsibilities and steps.
These high-level steps are shown on this slide.
"They include planning the project, identifying key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities, evaluating the current state of the shared drive within the agency, identifying and removing unwanted content, managing the content, and developing day-forward policies and procedures."
"When developing a project plan for organizing shared drives, consider these following items here."
Developing a communications plan can be helpful to tell others in the agency about what records management is planning so that they can be involved and know the purpose and scope of the project.
"Also identifying the shared drives that are candidates for organization, or that need to be organized."
And this can show where to focus energies.
Identifying and procuring and services or technologies to assist in the process.
"If procuring a contractor, this could include conducting a market survey, interviewing vendors, and preparing a statement of work."
"Once you've identified the shared drive and have the technology or contractor available, you can conduct a pilot to test the process and develop rules for the rest of the organization for how this can be done."
Paulette Murray:
Beth?
Beth Cron:
Yes?
Paulette Murray:
"It looks like we have two questions in the chat, if you want to tackle those quickly."
Beth Cron:
I'm seeing that.
"The question is, ""What is the NARA status of using auto-classification to assist in the shared drive cleanup?"
"Is it acceptable?"""
"Yes, this is something I'll address in the next few slides."
Auto-classification tools can be helpful in doing this process of running queries.
Having the technology or the software group related records can make the organization process much easier.
So we'll talk about that.
"In our own shared drive cleanup project at the National Archives, we used some tools to run queries on a shared drive."
The records officer Susan Sullivan led this records project.
We used the tool to help us identify the content that should be managed and the content that is either non-record or had met its disposition time.
"The next question is, ""Is it highly suggested that the records management be granted access to shared drives?"
"Should this be in policy?"""
I would say that is something that would be determined at the agency level.
"That the records are authentic, that they are what they claim to be."
That the records have not been altered or changed.
"And also that they can be located, retrieved, and opened."
"The fourth challenge is structuring folders, subfolders, and files within a shared drive to associate with their approved records schedule."
"This is a common idea that we saw with agencies, but it requires planning before using the shared drive to develop a structure that aligns with the approved records schedule."
It then requires those responsible for creating and managing records to follow that structure.
"So what that would look like is, the folders would line up with the items in the agency's record schedule."
Another challenge is implementing and maintaining audit trails to track the use of records.
"This is challenging because documents stored on shared drives can be edited, changed, or deleted by anyone who has access to that drive if there are not access controls in place."
It's difficult to find an audit trail of who has modified a document.
Property fields that are associated with the files are rarely populated with metadata.
And there could be missing context to the documents.
That's one thing to keep in mind.
"Organizing records and related dispositions when offices may change, merge, or cease to exist."
"When a shared drive is structured to correspond to the specific offices, that would need to be updated and changed if the offices went away or merged or moved to a different place."
This was the case at the National Archives when we recently underwent our Transformation.
We've had to reconfigure and update our structure for our shared drives.
"The last challenge is monitoring the record copies of long-term, temporary, or permanent records for technological obsolescence."
There's no built-in capability for shared drives to monitor when records should be migrated to their next version of the format.
And it may be necessary to use other tools to accomplish that.
Let's talk now about records management responsibilities.
Agencies are responsible for managing their records in accordance with 36-CFR Part 12 Subchapter B.
That's the long name for the NARA regulations.
Over the next few slides I'll look at the responsibilities that are in 36-CFR-123620.
These are the high level responsibilities that agencies must follow.
This specific regulation requires these following functionalities for managing records throughout their life cycle.
The first is to declare records.
That means identifying and filing the record copy within the shared drive and assigning unique identifiers to the records.
It also means capturing the records.
So it means importing records from other places or
linking them to other systems.
And then also organizing the records so that they're associated with their approved records schedule and disposition instructions.
And then personal files with no business value.
I have a little screenshot here.
You don't have to be able to read that.
But this is an example of the reports generated from the software that we ran on our shared drives.
These were all files identified that I had to review.
"It showed the file size, what the format is, and the date of last access."
This could show that these are all files that haven't been accessed for ten years.
"And so it's time to look at those and see what they are, and if they should be handled in a different way."
Reviewing and removing unwanted content could mean working with the subject matter experts.
"Once you have reports or queries generated, you can establish deadlines for when the subject matter experts should review the files."
It could mean scheduling meetings to review the files as a group.
And then documenting lessons learned to assist in developing future policies and procedures.
"In our experience, we ran queries and produced reports."
And then they were sent out for individuals to review.
And they could identify unwanted content.
Also we found that meeting with stakeholders was a quick way to identify content and tag it for removal or further followup.
"Once it's all cleaned up, then it's time to work with the subject matter experts to identify and review any remaining plans."
"This means identifying records, applying appropriate dispositions, and filing them appropriately according to their case files or disposition authorities."
Also developing a standardized folder directory structure.
And then implementing an office level file plan.
And then executing any disposition actions in accordance with NARA-approved record schedules.
"So in developing the day-forward policies and procedures to maintain and organize shared drives, these are some of the steps to take for maintenance activities on an ongoing basis."
Configuring the network to attribute file properties correctly.
This is one step that would mean working with IT to make sure everything's happening as it should.
Developing maintenance strategies.
"This could mean running periodic queries, doing the maintenance of figuring out what's coming up and what could be candidates for deletion or for other cleanup."
Also some agencies find it helpful to do annual or semi-annual cleanup days.
This could be a designated time set aside for people to go through their files and get them cleaned up.
Then implementing the folder structure and naming conventions.
Developing the written guidance and reference materials for shared drive users.
"And as always, providing training for staff once they've been able to look at the guidance and answer any questions that they have."
And then the maintenance and updates of the shared drive could be included as an item in internal records program reviews.
Identifying personal materials and non-records.
This could be extra copies or reference materials to ensure that they are maintained separately from federal records.
And then the final one on this slide is to identify the record copy and maintain it in an area designated for federal records.
This is what we were talking about with having the shared drive structured to match the records retention schedule.
"The next one is to establish and enforce naming conventions that are applicable at the folder, subfolder, and file level."
Some agencies have developed naming conventions that actually include the series in the title.
They may even have cutoff and disposal instructions within the title.
That's structuring the folder and subfolders to be associated with record schedules.
"Another strategy is to use metadata, file plans, and other tools to link related files in all media."
And then working with IT staff to ensure the integrity of the shared drive.
This means the access controls and audit trails.
To seek their assistance to see what kind of capabilities your system has.
"And if it's possible, to create audit trails."
"And then another one as always, training staff in the use of shared drives and records management responsibilities."
One thing to note here is that some of these strategies rely on manual intervention that could be done by an electronic system automatically.
There are some extra steps that would need to be taken in doing this in a manual way.
"I just want to remind you that if you have any questions at this point, go ahead and put them in the chat box."
And we'll be monitoring those.
The important thing to note about NARA's transfer guidance is that it applies to permanent records regardless of their location.
"So if they are permanent records, then they must be transferred to NARA in accordance with the transfer guidance."
I will make a side note here that the NARA team is currently updating the transfer guidance for permanent electronic records.
And this may result in the inclusion of additional acceptable formats.
So keep your eyes open for the upcoming guidance.
"If records on a shared drive are well-organized, this process of transferring permanent records to NARA will be much easier."
"For some other NARA resources and the toolkit for managing electronic records, we added a number of resources on shared drives."
These are from different organizations around the world.
"They're not endorsed by NARA, but are provided to show how other organizations or governments are encountering similar issues."
Go ahead and check that out.
This is a question that was in the bulletin.
Agency staff should contact their agency records officers to discuss specific questions about managing content on their shared drives.
And then the agency records officer can contact their NARA appraisal archivist.
In the next few slides I'm going to go over some information that we provided in the appendix.
What's the probability if each of them makes the defect with a one percent likelihood?
"Well, the likelihood of us making a defect at the very end is simply 0.1 raised to the power of three."
"If every one of them catches the defect, the redundancy kicks in and the defect is detected."
"So in order for the defect to happen here, at the end, all three of them have to go wrong."
We can then define the yield of this process as thirteen.
Minus 0.01 raised to the power of three.
"So you notice how the process flow diagram,"
A true understanding of what's happening in the process is driving how the individual defect probabilities get aggregated to an overall defect probability into the process here.
"In this session, we have discussed two examples of defects."
"In the assembly line example, we saw a situation in which a defect anywhere in the process would leave to a defective unit of flow at the end."
"In the Swiss Cheese situation, we could afford to have some mistakes in the process,"
"But due to redundancy, this would not necessarily lead to a bad unit of output."
Multiple things have to stack up in a bad way to lead to that fatal outcome.
"We've talked about how you can look at the process flow diagram, and then think about how to aggregate the individual defects, and compute an overall defect probability, and that allows you then to compute the process here."
"When improving processes like the ones we discussed, especially the Swiss Cheese situations, it's important to not just go after bad outcomes."
"Hopefully, these bad outcomes, at the end of the process, are really rare."
"Instead, you want to look at internal process variation."
This is the idea of near misses.
"It's also an idea we will see in more detail in the session on sig-, sigma."
The worst resources are those that sometimes work and sometimes they don't.
"If a resource always works and never does any defects, wonderful."
"If it is always broken, and everything the resource touches gets defective, we'll figure that out pretty quickly."
"In this session, we have used simple probability theory to describe the"
likelihood of a resource producing a defect.
We can then use defects in our understanding of the process flow diagram to describe the percentage of flow units that are produced correctly.
"We refer to that number, as the yield of an operation."
"Now, not every time, a resource does something the wrong way,"
We'll get a yield loss at the end of the process.
Some defects and internal variation are absorbed by other activities.
"There is redundance oftentimes built into the process,"
"However, understanding such deviations in the process,"
"Even if they do not lead to fatal consequences at the end of the process, is a very important point of a good quality management program."

Optic nerve
"The optic nerve, also known as cranial nerve II or simply as CN II, is one of twelve cranial nerves but is also considered to be part of the central nervous system. It sends information from the retina (the outermost part of the eye) to the brain. The brain forms a picture using the information so that you can see things."
The retina sees the image upside-down and the optic nerve sends it to the brain so it turns it back into normal.

Brett E. Crozier
"Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier ""Theodore Roosevelt"", he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19, a disease that affects the lungs and breathing. Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt"" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely."
"In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt""."
Career.
"Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003. He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College. He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the ""USS Ronald Reagan"". Brett Crozier was captain of the ""USS Blue Ridge"" from June 2017 to November 2018."
Letters.
"He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper ""San Francisco Chronicle"" on March 31, 2020."
"COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the ""Diamond Princess"" cruise ship, and said that even though the ""Diamond Princess""'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected. He said the ""Theodore Roosevelt"" only had a few private rooms."
"Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who used to be NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, agreed that it was not possible to perform social distancing on board a navy ship like the ""Theodore Roosevelt""."
Firing.
High-ranking leaders at the Navy said that removing Crozier from his ship was normal. They said Crozier should have asked for help by going through the chain of command instead of writing letters to other people in the military.
"According to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: ""It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job."""
"According to ""The New York Times"", ""a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship."""
"Kathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other."

"'As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication...There have been many disgusting statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part. These statements about me are totally false...I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the mass—matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, because I am innocent. I have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examination...It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life...But if this is what I have to endure to prove my innocence, my complete innocence, so be it.'"
Settlement.
"The case was settled in 1994 with a payment of over $15 million to be put in Jordan Chandler's trust fund, $1.5 million for each of his parents, and $5 million for the family's lawyer. No criminal charges were ever made against Jackson. In 2004 Jackson's attorney for the 2005 Michael Jackson trial Thomas Mesereau Jr. said that Jackson regretted making these payments."
Aftermath.

Caroline Herschel
Caroline Herschel (16 March 1750 – 9 January 1848) was a German astronomer who spent most of her life in England. She was the first female astronomer that we know of.
"She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist. She was the first woman in England to hold a government position. She was the first woman to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was also named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846)."
Early life.
"Caroline was born on March 16, 1750 in Hanover, Germany. She was encouraged by her father to get an education. She learnt geometry on her own. She had a hard life because people that she loved died. After her father's death, her brother William Herschel suggested she join him in England. She left Hanover for England on August 16, 1772, with her brother."
"In England, Caroline's neighbour taught her how to cook, market, and to speak English. This expanded her horizons. William encouraged her to be independent. She signed up to learn how to sing and to play the harpsichord. This led her to being a part of William’s musical shows in small gatherings. She and William discussed astronomy in their free time. This caused her interest to grow. Caroline began including English society in her everyday life. She eventually decided to devote her time to astronomy. This helped William: he needed Caroline’s talents in copying papers."
Astronomy.
"When they were in England, Caroline helped her brother in his scientific work. She helped him to discover Uranus with a six-foot telescope. William was credited with the discovery of Uranus. He was knighted because of his discovery, and she was his assistant. She recorded and completed tasks for him. Her calculations and record keeping were always accurate. They saved her brother a lot of time. Caroline often worked on discoveries of her own. She independently discovered the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 110; NGC 205) and another, new, nebula. She also discovered eight comets in 17861795."
"She reworked Flamsteed's ""Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars"". The result was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included. In 1825, Caroline donated the works of Flamsteed to the Royal Academy of Göttingen."
"She was the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered seven more comets between 1789 and 1797. The comet 35P/Herschel-Rigollet is named in her honor, as well as the lunar crater C. Herschel, and the planetoid (281) Lucretia. She also is famous for her work with her brother. She aided him in his studies. She reorganized John Flamsteed's ""British Catalogue"", which listed nearly 3,000 stars."
Herschel's brother died in 1822 and left her without his financial support. She returned to Hanover after his death and received her stipend from the British Royal Family. She also helped her brother's son finish his father's work.
Awards.
Caroline Herschel was awarded a gold medal for her works in science from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. She was made an honorary member at the Royal Astronomical Society ten years later. Herschel also received a similar award from the Royal Irish Academy. She was awarded the gold medal for science by the King of Prussia on her ninety-sixth birthday.
Legacy.
"Toward the end of Caroline's life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. Her nephew, John Herschel, re-examined them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number."
"Herschel died on January 9, 1848 in Germany. She died at the age of 97. Herschel was never married."
"An asteroid was discovered in 1888. It was called Lucretia, Herschel's middle name. Herschel continued to have a legacy after her death because she discovered several comets."

He was born in the city of Hailar (Manchuria), where he attended a local Tatar elementary school before entering a Russian lycee. After completing the lycee in 1936, he went to study at Al-Azhar University in Cairo (Egypt), and in 1938, along with another young nationalist, Ahat Ginish, went to Poland. Akish and Ginish served as technical assistants to Ayaz Iskhaki at the Idel-Ural National Center, where the newspaper “Yanga Milli Yul"" (New National Path) was published. Their work was interrupted by the invasion of Poland by the Nazi and Soviet forces."
"Akish lived from 1940 to 1966 in Turkey where he was involved with the diaspora national movement. His pamphlet “Problems of Idel-Ural and Soviet Imperialism” printed in 1963 received great attention and provoked repercussions in the USSR in the form of two books, one ostensibly written by the President of the Tatar ASSR, Salikh Batiyev in 1977.

The article was highly significant as one of the first published in Turkey critical of Zhirinovsky and his views."
"He was able to visit Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia. On his first visit to Kazan he brought, at his own expense, a computer that he donated to the Tatar Public Center. Akish dedicated his whole life to the liberation of the Tatar people from colonial oppression. The World Tatar League named him honorary president in recognition of his achievements. A school was named in his honor in the city of Chally (Naberezhniye Chelny) in Tatarstan."

"Bilal ibn Rabah (, also called Bilal al-Habashi) was an Ethiopian born in Mecca in the late 6th century, sometime between 578 and 582.Bilal was an Ethiopian slave. Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him. When Muhammad heard about this, he ordered Abu Bakr to buy Bilal's freedom and Bilal -who was now free- joined Muhammad's companions."
"Muhammad choose Bilal as the first muezzin. A muezzin is someone who leads the call to daily prayer. Sometimes Bilal walked the streets to call Muslims to come to prayer but most of the times, he said the Adhan from the top of the mosque."
"Some years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"After Muhammad died, Bilal never said the Adhan again - except on two occasions. Once in Syria and the second time, in Medina, when Muhammad's grandson, Hasan ibn Ali asked him to do so."
Bilal died in Damascus between 638 and 642 (AD).
Legacy.
Hadith books are the collections of Muhammad's sayings.
Muhammad used to say about Bilal:
"When Bilal was chosen as the Muezzin, some people complained to Muhammad. They believed only an Arab can be a Muezzin, because Bilal could not pronounce the Arabic words correctly and he used to pronounce ""s"" instead of ""sh"". When Muhammad heard their complaint, he said:"
Aisha
"Aisha bint Abu Bakr (604-678; ) was the third wife of Muhammad. Aisha is given honour in Islam, especially in the Sunni branch. She is often called by Muslims ""Umm-al-mu'minin"" which means ""the Mother of the Believers""."
Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr of Mecca. Aisha was six years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad. (Marriage under the age of 21 was common worldwide at the time) She was not Muhammad's only wife.
"Her ten-year marriage to Muhammad ended when he died. Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning the Quran, and the Sunnah of Muhammad."
Deputy
"A deputy is a person who helps someone do their job when they are not there. ""Deputy"" is a rank or title. It usually refers to someone who is ""second-in-command"".

A ""deputy conductor"" will conduct an orchestra when the main (principal) conductor is not there. It is similar to an ""assistant"". Someone who is working as a deputy will deputize (stand in for someone else)."

Life.
"André Previn was born as Andreas Ludwig Priwin to a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany.

"Quorn, South Australia"
"Quorn is a small town in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, 39 km northeast of Port Augusta. In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey."
It is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.
History.
"The town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the ""Ghan line"" or Central Australia Railway."
"In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north–south Central Australian Railway and east–west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east–west or north–south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded."
"Quorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta."
"During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a ""through"" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker."
"In 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday."
Tourism.
"A main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs."

"President Ronald Reagan signed a bill, proposed by Representative Katie Hall of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King. The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986. It is observed on the third Monday of January."
Washington's Birthday
"Presidents' Day, originally was two separate observances, Abraham Lincoln's birthday, which was February 12, and George Washington's birthday, which was February 22. The two observances were combined in 1971 into a single observance which is held on the third Monday in February."
Memorial Day
"Memorial Day is a national holiday in the United States. It is also a state holiday in many states. The holiday honors troops who have died in past wars like World War I and the Korean War. It was founded by U.S. Army General John A. Logan, who fought in the Civil War and the Mexican–American War."
"Memorial Day was first held in 1865 after the American Civil War. It was called Decoration Day at that time. The holiday was first called Memorial Day in 1882, and became a federal holiday in 1967. On June 28, 1968, the United States Congress made a law that said that the official Memorial Day holiday is May 30, but that Memorial Day was to be observed by federal employees as a paid holiday on the last Monday in May."
Memorial Day is thought of by many Americans as being the start of summer.
Columbus Day
Columbus Day is a holiday celebrating the day Columbus landed on San Salvador. It is celebrated in many countries. This holiday is very controversial because of the way Columbus treated the Native Americans at the time.
Veterans Day

The holiday is celebrated on the same day as Armistice Day or Remembrance Day in other countries. These holidays are all November 11. This is the day seen as the end of World War I. The first World War ended on November 11, 1918."
"The holiday was first created as Armistice Day in 1919 by President Woodrow Wilson. Thirty states made it a state holiday that year. It was made a holiday for the entire country in 1938. In June 1, 1954, the name was changed to Veterans Day."
Ralph Vaughan Williams
"Ralph Vaughan Williams (b. Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, 12 October 1872; d. London, 26 August 1958) was the most important English composer of his generation."
Vaughan Williams always pronounced his first name “Rafe” - (“Vaughan” rhymes with “born”). His father was a rector. Ralph was very young when his father died. The family moved to Dorking near London. He went to Charterhouse School and played the viola in the school orchestra. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music where Hubert Parry was his teacher.
Early career.
"Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer, so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris. Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers, so he also studied English folk song. He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst. The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism."
"In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best-known pieces of music: the ""Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis"". The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections. It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis. He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal. One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called ""Sine Nomine"" sung to the words “For all the saints”. Another lovely work is ""The Lark Ascending"". This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra. The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky. In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute, harp and string orchestra called ""Fantasia on Greensleeves"" which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune ""Greensleeves""."
Later works.
"During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies, works for the stage, songs, choral music and chamber music. In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called ""Serenade to Music"" for 16 solo singers and orchestra. It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare. The words were from the play ""The Merchant of Venice"". It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Wood’s career as a conductor. In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, including a very short and simple motet ""O taste and see"" which has remained very popular with church choirs."
In his old age he became quite deaf. This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I.
Urðarbrunnr
"Urðarbrunnr (Old Norse for the ""Well of Urðr"") is a well in Norse mythology. It is situated under the Yggdrasil or the world tree. Norse mythology is a version of the older northern Germanic mythology. The gods would travel via the bifrost with the exception of Thor as it was thought that he would break the bridge which took the form of a rainbow, to Urðarbrunnr. Here they would meet and decide things, presumably laws of nature and magic and love and war."
Mario Party 5
"Mario Party 5 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube console. It is the fifth game in the ""Mario Party"" series. It was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It was released on November 10, 2003 in North America, on November 28, 2003 in Japan, and on December 5, 2003 in Europe."
Gameplay.
"""Mario Party 5"" plays the same as the first four ""Mario Party"" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the ""Capsule Machine"" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away."
"Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character."
"In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games."

Parable of the Prodigal Son
"The Parable of the Prodigal Son is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found only in the Gospel of Luke at 15:11-32. The parable is about a son who wastes his share of his father's estate. He loses all his money and gets work feeding pigs—one of the lowest jobs a person can do according to the Jewish religion. He repents and returns to his father's house. He is welcomed and a feast is held. His older, dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son. His father reminds him that all he has is his. He says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them. In the Western Catholic church, this parable is usually read on the third Sunday of Lent. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the ""Sunday of the Prodigal Son"". The parable is the subject of much art, music, literature, and stage works."
"This is the last of three parables about loss and redemption. It follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin. Jesus tells this parable after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with ""sinners."" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love, the ""boundless mercy of God,"" and ""God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace."""
Parable of the Mustard Seed
"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31–32), Gospel of Mark (4:30–32), and Gospel of Luke (13:18–19). The differences among the three tellings are minor."
"In Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20."
"The parable from Matthew reads: ""The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar."
Parable of the Lost Sheep
"The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in the Gospel of Matthew at 18:12–14 and the Gospel of Luke at 15:3–7. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. The parable is one of three that tell of loss and redemption. The others are The Lost Coin and The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep tells of a shepherd who leaves his 99 sheep to search for one sheep that is lost. Joel B. Green writes that ""these parables are ... about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."" The parable has been depicted often in art."

It stands at the western end of ""Brandenburger Straße"", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul."
"Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling."
"Towards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory."
Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.

Plot.
"The Simpsons family is watching a murder show on TV. Lisa sees Maggie trying to get their attention so she changes the channel to a show that teaches babies sign language. Maggie was trying to tell them that Hans Moleman is stuck under a tree that fell, but the family does not notice. In the morning, they keep watching the show and Hans is taken to an ambulance."
"The show is cancelled because the government stopped funding the show, so Marge tries teaching Maggie sign language herself. Marge tries to tell the family about Maggie's development, but the family is too busy on their devices. Marge decides to limit everyone's screen time to half an hour a week."
"Marge catches Homer, Bart, and Lisa having their screen time changed by a technician, so she puts away the devices completely. Homer is bored at work, so he starts playing word puzzles in a newspaper. Marge sees how strong devices are affecting Patty and Selma. Bart uses his imagination at school when he gets a toy rocket down from the school roof. Lisa gets the feeling of joy when she finds books from the library without using devices."
"Marge can not find the recipe she is looking for, so when the family comes back home, they find her in the closet with her phone and laptop. Marge admits that she is the one who is addicted to devices. She signs the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center, a place to treat screen addictions."

Swift
The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
"The scientific name for the swift (""apus"") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, ""apous"" which means ""without feet"". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. It is often thought that if they land on ground, they cannot fly up again, but that is not true. They can take off but with difficulty."
Description.
"Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey."
"Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the shape of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape."
"Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer."
Nests.
"Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest."
"There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus ""Aerodramus"". In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China."

A press release gives reporters the basic information they need to write a news story. Press releases can announce a range of news items such as: events, promotions, awards, new products and services, sales and other financial data, accomplishments, etc."
"A ""press statement"" is information given to reporters. This is an official statement or account of a news story that is specially written for newspapers and other news media for them to make known to the public."

Here is a famous short game in the more usual short notation:
Figurine notation.
"This is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces. Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess. Since it avoids initial letters for pieces, it is more international."
Notation for positions.
"In addition to the Forsyth notation, positions may be recorded in this simple fashion:"
Akiba Rubinstein
"Akiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.p346"
Biography.
"Rubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford Companion to Chess"". Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź."
"Rubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca).p79 Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from ""Chessmetrics"" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911."
"Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I."
"After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver."
Mental health.
"After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family."
"Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt."
Chess heritage.
"He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames."
"He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence."
"Today, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence."
"The Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead."
"The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj, with a glittering list of top-flight winners."

He is considered one of the great figures of American photography.
"Chambi is famous for the historic and social value of his photographs. He was a portrait photographer in the cities and the countryside of the Peruvian Andes. He was the leading portrait photographer in the Andean city of Cusco. Chambi also took many landscape photographs, and he sold these photographs as postcards. He was one of the first to use the postcard format in Peru."
"In 1979, MOMA in New York had a Chambi exhibition. The exhibition later moved to various locations. It inspired other international exhibitions of his work."
Kleophrades Painter
"The Kleophrades Painter was a red-figure Athenian vase painter. His real name is unknown. His name is taken from a potter's signature on a vase. He was active from about 510470 BC. His work is considered some of the finest of the red figure style. He was probably the pupil of Euthymides, one of the red-figure Pioneers. His work is identified by its stylistic traits. He was very productive. More than 100 vases of his work have survived. He worked in both black- and red- figure styles and techniques. He was conservative, often using old-fashioned techniques. His subjects were traditional but with a emphasis on the Trojan War. He preferred painting large vessels such as amphores."

He was a strong supporter of indigenous Australian rights (including land rights) and national aid for schools. In 1977, he was elected to the House of Representatives as member for Melbourne Ports. When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister in 1983, he put Holding in charge of Aboriginal Affairs. During his term, Holding tried to make federal laws for Aboriginal land rights. But Brian Burke, the Labor Premier of Western Australia, did not want this, because it would have upset the mining and agricultural industries, which were very important to his state. Holding was forced by Hawke to drop the proposal. In 1987, he was moved to the Ministry of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. The next year, he was made Minister for Transport, and then later Minister for Immigration."

"The band in which he became famous was called Gondwanaland. He has toured across Australia, often visiting remote communities in the outback, and also in Europe and the United States. He often played gigs with Midnight Oil. McMahon's style became an influence for many well-known didgeridoo players. He is also the inventor of the ""didjeribone"", a sliding didgeridoo made of plastic, played in a similar way to the trombone."
Symposium
"A symposium (plural: symposia) was a drinking party in Ancient Greece. Guests were males. Well bred women did not attend. Boys or slave girls served the food and drink, danced, juggled, played music, or otherwise entertained the assembly. These servers were usually nude. The symposium was an aristocratic institution often held to celebrate a young man's entry into adult society, an athletic victory, or a poetic achievement. It was an occasion for male conversation and debate. Party-goers reclined on couches and pillows. Guests played a game called kottabos, wrestled, and held song contests.

Battle of Bataan
The Battle of Bataan was part of Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.
"The capture of the Philippine Islands was important to Japan's goals. Japan wanted to control the Southwest Pacific, capture the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asia side."
It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino military history. It was the largest United States surrender since the pre-Civil War's raid on Harper's Ferry.
Invasion.
"Japanese carrier planes attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. Japanese aircraft also bombed the main bases of the American Far East Air Force near Manila, and the headquarters of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines. Many American planes were destroyed. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet withdrew its ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreated south. Only the submarine force was left to fight the Japanese."
"From 8 to 10 December, Japan captured airfields at Batan Island, Aparri, and Vigan City. Army Air Force B-17s attacked Japanese ships. U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the flagship ""Nagato"", a destroyer and sank one minesweeper."
"The main attack was on 22 December 1941. The 14th Japanese Imperial Army attacked, led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma."
War Plan Orange-3.
"After capturing the beaches, the Japanese launched a major attack."
"The American commander, General Douglas MacArthur, realized that the beach defense plan had failed. On 26 December, he said that War Plan Orange-3 (WPO-3) was now being used. This was a plan to defend only Bataan and Corregidor. The plan of WPO-3 was to delay Japanese forces until the U.S. Pacific Fleet could get to the Philippines."
"Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippines, his family and government staff were moved to Corregidor. MacArthur's headquarters were also moved to Corregidor."
The retreat.
Gen. MacArthur wanted to move his men to defensive positions.
"When the Japanese attacked, the untrained Philippine Army troops defending the beach were beaten. The U.S. decided to fight at Layac to slow down the Japanese troops. Later, from 1 to 5 January 1942, the U.S. fought to allow its troops to withdraw to Bataan."
WPO-3 had two defensive lines across Bataan.
The stand.
"On 9 January, Japanese forces under Lt. Gen. Susumu Morioka attacked the eastern side of the Abucay-Mauban line. They were beaten by the U.S. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River valley. U.S. troops fought off the attackers. At another battle to the west, a Japanese force got past the Abucay-Mauban line. The U.S. stopped their advance. On 15 January, 1st Regular Division was bombed, but they held the line. The Japanese moved through a gap. The Abucay-Mauban line had to be abandoned on 22 January."
"Within four days, the Orion-Bagac line was formed. The remaining Japanese troops managed to get through. General Homma ordered the stopping of all operations to reorganize his forces. On 22 February the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north."
"Japanese troops landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. The US sunk two barges and the rest scattered into two groups. The Japanese forces were stopped by Philippine Constabulary units and U.S. Army Air Corps men fighting as infantry. Japanese commanders sent new troops to the beaches, but they could not break out."
Fall of Bataan.
"On the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family left Corregidor. MacArthur went to Australia. He promised the Filipino people that he ""shall return"". After the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese sent artillery forces to the Philippines. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150 mm cannons, and the Type 96 240 mm field howitzer. The Japanese sent new troops to Gen. Homma's 14th Imperial Army. Toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final attack."

Geography.
"Lavori Publici FC (or ""Lavori Pubblici FC"" in Italian language) was an historical football team in Mogadishu, that officially existed from 1947 to 1990."
History.
"The football team was created in the late 1940s by a group of football fans representing all the Italian colonists of all Italian Somalia with the name ""Genio Officina"", as an antagonist to the AC Mogadiscio (the team of the Italians of only the capital Mogadishu) in the first amauteur championship of Somalia. The team was officially inscribed in the Somalia first league championship in 1952 as ""Lavori Publici FC/Genio"", winning the tournament of that year."
"The team had a lot of followers who were native Somalis and so survived until 1990 when the Somali civil war started, while the antagonist AC Mogadiscio disappeared when Italy gave the independence to Somalia in 1960 (and nearly all the Italians of Somalia left the country)."
Damien Hirst
"Damien Steven Hirst (born 7 June 1965) is an English artist. He is one of the Young British Artists (YBAs). The YBAs became famous during the 1990s. He is reportedly the United Kingdom's richest living artist. In 2010 the ""Sunday Times"" estimated his wealth at £215 million. During the 1990s he worked together with famous art collector Charles Saatchi. Hirst and Saatchi had disagreements, and they ended their friendship in 2003."
"Death is a central theme in Hirst's works. He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals are preserved in formaldehyde. The animals included a sheep, a cow and a shark. The best-known of these was ""The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living"". This was a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a transparent display case. He has also made ""spin paintings"". These were created on a rotating canvas. And ""spot paintings"", which are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants."
"In September 2008, Hirst sold all the artworks of a show during one auction at Sotheby's. This had never been done before by a living artist. The auction made him £111 million ($198 million), breaking the record for an auction by a single artist. It also broke Hirst's own record with £10.3 million for ""The Golden Calf"", an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde."
"Since 1999 some of Hirst's works have been claimed to be plagiarised. It was discovered that his sculpture ""Hymn"" was closely based on a child's toy. Hirst was sued by the original creator of the toy, and the case was settled out-of-court."

Reuben
Reuben was the son of Jacob and Leah in the Book of Genesis.
Birth.
"Jacob was in love with Rachel, the daughter of Laban and asked to marry her. Laban said he would let Jacob marry her if he worked for him as a shepherd for seven years. Jacob worked for those years but they felt like they were only seven days because of how much he loved Rachel. But then, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Rachel’s older sister Leah instead of marrying her and said he didn’t believe in the younger daughter marrying before her older sister married so Jacob had to work for Laban for another seven years so that Laban would let him marry Rachel. Jacob loved Rachel but he did not love Leah so Leah prayed to the Lord saying “give me children, for I am despised”. So the Lord had mercy on her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And Leah said “now my husband shall love me” and named her son Reuben."
Mandrakes.
"After Leah gave birth to Simeon, Levi and Judah (Biblical personage), Bilhah gave birth to Gad and Asher, Zilpah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali and Leah gave birth to Zebulun and Issachar, then Reuben found mandrakes and gave them to his mother Leah. When Rachel asked Leah for the mandrakes,Leah said “first you take from me my husband and now the mandrakes of my son” and agreed to give Rachel the mandrakes if Leah became Jacob’s main wife."
Bilhah.
It’s written in the Torah that Reuben lay down with Bilhah and that his father Jacob heard about it. (Genesis 35:22) Though the Talmud says that this was a metaphor and that Reuben actually took Bilhah’s bed from his father’s tent but that this was seen as being like the sin of incest (Shabbat 55) and says that this works because in the Book of Job wanting to commit incest is seen as committing incest.
The story of Joseph.
"In the story of Joseph, when the brothers are about to kill Joseph, Reuben tells them that instead of murdering him they should throw him into a big hole in the ground and leave him to die. But Reuben secretly planned to rescue Joseph and so when Reuben came back to save Joseph and found out that he had already been sold into slavery, Reuben tore his clothes in mourning for Joseph. And after Simeon was jailed, Reuben told his brothers that the Lord was punishing them all for what they did to Joseph."
Inheritance.
"According to Jewish tradition, Reuben didn’t get the inheritance that a firstborn son would usually get because he was being punished for the sin with Bilhah."
Talmud.
"Rabbi Shimon son of Eliezer teaches that after Leah died and Jacob moved his bed to the tent of Bilhah, Reuben took the bed from Bilhah’s tent and put in the tent of his mother Leah to honour his mother’s memory and the sin Reuben committed by doing that was compared to incest but Reuben did not actually have sex with Bilhah. Though there are also Rabbis in the Talmud who say that he did."
The Zohar.
"According to the Zohar, Reuben lying down with Bilhah cannot be wikt:literally true because then Reuben wouldn’t have become the father of a tribe of the Israelites. It says that Reuben knew from prophecy that there were supposed to be only twelve tribes of Israel so he moved his father’s bed from Bilhah’s tent even though the Shechina is there whenever married people do their religious duty to have sex with each other but by meddling Reuben made the Shechina leave that tent and that was Reuben’s sin."
Affenpinscher
"The Affenpinscher is a small breed of dog in the toy group. These dogs originally came from Germany. They are known to have existed since the 1600s. Their name comes from the German word ""Affe,"" which means ""monkey,"" because their faces remind people of monkeys. Originally, the dog was bred to be a ""ratter,"" a type of dog that kills rats and mice in homes, farms, and stables. Now that mice are not so commonly found in the home, Affenpinschers are usually just kept as pets."
Appearance.
"The Affenpinscher is a very small kind of dog. It weighs between . Its height is between at the shoulder. Their face is flat and ""monkey-like."" The most common and preferred colour of fur for this breed is black, but they can also come in grey, beige, and other colours. In the American Kennel Club, a good example of these dogs could be any colour. In the French and British Kennel Clubs they must only be black."
Reproduction.
"All Bush Vipers are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They mate between September and November, and females give to their young in March or April."
Venom.
"The venom of Bush Vipers is hemotoxic, it causes pain, swelling, and stop blood clotting. There is no antivenom, but there has been reports on Echis antivenom working on some Bush Viper's bites."
Maristes Valldemia
"The Maristes Valldemia school (aka: Col·legi Maristes Valldemia, Col·legi Valldemia or Valldemia), is in Mataró, Province of Barcelona - Catalonia (Spain). It is a Catholic school run by Marist Brothers. It is dedicated to Our Lady the Virgin of the Candle. ""Fundació Champagnat, Fundació Privada"" owns the school."
"The school was founded in 1855 by three Piarists related persons: the priest Ermengol Coll de Valldemia, Pelegrí Ferrer and Ramon Cuspinera. Its first name was «Colegio de Cataluña», and it was on the land of a traditional Catalan manor named ""Can Miralpeix"". The school's aim was to provide a modern and Christian education. After 1858, the school was known as «» (in Catalan) or «» (in Spanish). In 1888 the school was given to the Marist Brothers to run."
From 2012 the official name is Maristes Valldemia.
"The main building was designed by the architect Jeroni Boada, and later improved in 1911 by Josep Goday i Casals (who used to be an student at the school, and founder member of the Alumni Association)."
"The school received its first international recognition at the Paris Exposition of 1900, a Gold Medal in recognition of quality education. During the convulsive years that marked the Spanish Civil War, Valldemia was converted into a hospital and blood bank."
"Today, the school has 1200 students from ages 3 to 18, who are taught by a staff of 90 teachers."

Pierce the Veil
"Pierce the Veil is an post hardcore group formed in San Diego, California in 2007. The band consists of frontman Vic Fuentes, percussionist Mike Fuentes, bassist Jaime Preciado, and guitarist Tony Perry. They released their debut studio album ""A Flair for the Dramatic"" on June 26, 2007 and released the singles ""Yeah Boy and Doll Face"" and ""Chemical Kids and Mechanical Brides.""

The band started joining Vans Warped Tour and playing on side stages to promote their music alongside other post-hardcore bands. In 2012, the band prepped their third album ""Collide with the Sky"", which was released on July 17, 2012, and released the singles ""King for a Day"" and ""Bulls in the Bronx."" They started performing live on the main stage at Warped Tour throughout the summer of 2012."
"The two leading members of the band were known to be in a band called Before Today before Pierce the Veil was formed with the addition of Tony Perry and Jaime Preciado. Side projects included Mike and Vic Fuentes being in the alternative rock group Isles &amp; Glaciers, which split up in 2010.

The second single titled ""Bulls in the Bronx"" was released on June 25, 2012 for digital download. The band supported the album throughout the 2012 Van's Warped Tour in the summer."
Album artwork.
"According to Vic Fuentes, ""the theme to the album artwork is 'jumping off of the ground that is breaking beneath you'. The idea is to inspire hope amongst the chaos that may be happening around you. If the ground was breaking beneath your feet, your first reaction may be to run and jump to safety, and it's that moment where you are suspended in the air that I am focusing on. A still frame where you're not sure if the person is falling or flying. It's about freeing yourself from the things that are breaking or falling apart in your life, and inspiring a sense of hope from the desperation""."
Reception.
"The album has been received rather well by critics. Alternative Press rated the album 4/5 stars saying ""Collide with the Sky is PTV's best work to date"". They praised the album for the power pop hooks on ""Props &amp; Mayhem"", saying that you should download ""Tangled in the Great Escape"". AbsolutePunk commented that the album is ""sure to continue Pierce the Veil's steady ascent to the top of their league"", concluding that ""[it] proves Pierce the Veil are seemingly still one step ahead of everyone else when it comes to concocting energetic slices of post-hardcore and that they won’t be dropping the ball any time soon."""

"The album was released in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2012. It was released in the United States on July 17, 2012 with the release of the bonus track ""Hold On Till May"", the acoustic version."
Pedro Armendáriz Jr.
"Pedro Armendáriz, Jr. (April 6, 1940 – December 26, 2011) was a Mexican actor and television actor."
Early life.
"In general, the values for 5, 50, and 500 are not subtracted. Here is the same number using the subtraction rule:"
Special values.
Zero.
"The number zero does not have its own Roman numeral. At about 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the abbreviation (short form) of ""nihil"" (the Latin word for ""nothing"")."
Fractions.
"The Romans also used fractions. The most common base for fractions was 1/12, which in Latin is called ""uncia"" (ounce)."
Large numbers.
"A number of numeral systems are developed for large numbers that cannot be shown with , , , , , and ."
Apostrophus.
"One of the systems is the ""apostrophus"", in which D is written as IƆ (500) and M is written as CIƆ (1,000). In this system, an extra Ɔ means 500, and multiple extra Ɔs are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc."
Vinculum.
"Another system is the ""vinculum"", in which V, X, L, C, D and M are multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline."
Map
"A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation. Many maps are called ""charts"" such as star charts and nautical charts. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on paper. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used."
"The word ""map"" can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map."
People who make maps are cartographers.
Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records.
"If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected. This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat. There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections. The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere. This is called a globe."
Globe
"A globe is a scale model with the shape of a sphere. Globes can be scale models of the Earth (""terrestrial globes"") or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the celestial sphere (""celestial globes""). The English word ""globe"" comes from the , meaning round mass or sphere."
Most globes are maps of the Earth. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat map projections. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers. Some globes are star charts and some are maps of distant worlds.
"Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system, rather than its individual little parts."
History.
"That the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BC. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages in existence. The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the ancient Greek Crates of Mallus made in the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Greek geographer Strabo wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the Roman Empire."
"A celestial globe from Classical Antiquity is in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy. The globe is part of a sculpture – the globe is held up by a statue of Atlas, a Titan from Greek mythology. The ancient Romans made the globe and statue in the 2nd century AD. They may have copied the sculpture from Hellenistic art (art of the ancient Greek type) from the Hellenistic period (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ""Farnese Atlas""."
"Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun. Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267."
"Martin Behaim designed a globe in 1492, in Nuremberg, Bavaria (Germany). Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase ""Here be dragons"". Another ""remarkably modern-looking"" globe of the Earth was made in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Taqi al-Din at his Constantinople Observatory during the 1570s."
Manufacture.
"Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere."
"From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point."
"It also has been known as both a classic and a masterpiece, and has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23, 2001, exatly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a direct-to-video sequel called Dumbo II. The preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day. The project seems to have been canceled,as no further announcements have been made since, plus the fact that The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, Tinker Bell, and its sequels, were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios."
The crow characters in the movie are often seen as African-American stereotypes.
"The leader crow voiced by Cliff Edwards was originally named ""Jim Crow"" for script purposes. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors and singers, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir: Nick Stewart, James Baskett, Jim Carmichael and Hall Johnson. The late famous duo of African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson were invited and hired by Disney to work as live-action reference and models for the animators of the characters, like the chief-animator and Disney Legend Ward Kimball, improvising dances and movements then used in the iconic musical sequence ""When I See An Elephant Fly"". Despite suggestions of racism by writers like Richard Schickel, many historians, critics, writers, pundits and personalities such as John Grant, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Floyd Norman, Eric Goldberg, Alex Wainer, Michael Wilmington, Whoopi Goldberg and Neal Gabler reject these claims. For instance, the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are empathetic and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight (the others are Timothy Q. Mouse and Mrs Jumbo), they are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence and of what means being ostracized and marginalized, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time and in the previous decade. Furthermore, their song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears."
Media and marketing.
Dumbo's Circus.
"""Dumbo's Circus"" was a live-action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the movie, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes."
Theme parks.
"Dumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris), and Hong Kong Disneyland."
Video games.
"Dumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts. Sora, the main character, flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk."
Bertolt Brecht
(born ;* 10. February 1898 in Augsburg; † 14. August 1956 in Berlin) was a German poet and dramatist.
Life.
"Brecht went to school in Augsburg, where his father was the director of a paper factory."
He completed his degree in 1917.
"Afterwards he studied sciences, medicine and literature at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. He had to take a break in his studies because he had to join the army."
"In the 1920s, Brecht went to Berlin and became a part of the cultural scene. He met his second wife Helene Weigel in Berlin and married her, after divorcing his first wife. It was with his second wife that Brecht had another son."
In Berlin he met a lot of artists and intellectuals of the Weimar Republic.
"His works became very critical about the capitalistic society (e.g. ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (1930)). Many of his friends were communists, but he never joined the KPD."
"His most famous work was from that time, the ""Dreigroschenoper""."
In 1933 the Nazis prohibited playing some of his works and arrested some of his friends.
"After the Reichstag fire, he travelled from Germany to Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and Denmark."
"For the next five years he lived in Denmark. In 1938 he wrote ""Das Leben des Galilei"" (The Life of Galilei) about Galileo Galilei, who was hunted by the Holy Inquisition because he wanted to tell the scientific truth."
When Germany occupied Denmark he had to flee once again.
"He went to Sweden, then to Finland and finally to Moscow in the Soviet Union."
Even under Stalin he was not safe. He therefore flew through China to the United States.
He lived and worked in California and translated a lot of text.
"In 1947, in the McCarthy era, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated him, because they suspected him of being a communist."
He gave a statement and said that he had never been a member of the communist party.

Microcredits also work differently: the interest ot be paid is usually much higher than with a regular loan, often it is over 20%. The interest usually also has to be paid more often. Microcredits have been criticized, because people taking them often end up in a situation where they cannot repay their debt."

Reptiliomorpha
Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians).
"Unfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs, but are not synapsids. Otherwise precursors of reptiles (sauropsids) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids)."
"Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with ""Seymouria"", it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups."
Youth Riding a Hippalektryon (Epiktetos)
"Youth Riding a Hippalektryon is a circular painting (tondo) in the bottom of the bowl of an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup. It was painted by Epiktetos. It is dated to the Archaic period of Greek art (ca. 530–520 BC). The cup stands about 5 1/8 in. (13 cm) tall. A hippalektryon is a mythical creature, part horse and part rooster. The cup is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The museum writes, ""Late sixth-century vases connected with drinking occasionally have subjects that go beyond the familiar gorgons, griffins, or sphinxes. The hippalektryon belongs to this category. It is interesting to compare this piece to the fine early red-figure plate by Epiktetos showing a youth riding a rooster."""

"The tondo depicts an older, balding man reclining on a couch and singing. The setting is probably a drinking party (""symposium""). These cups were meant to be used at such parties and were often decorated with party scenes."
"The tondo presented problems to painters. It was difficult to present upright figures in a circle. Epiktetos solved this problem by using the couch as a line. The man's mantle slipping from the couch creates depth and space. The museum writes, ""Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it."""

The outside of the cup depicts bearded men and youths exercising with discus and javelin. A youth in a long robe plays music. The pictures reflect the interests of the aristocrats who would have used such a cup at a drinking party."
Salt pan
"A salt plain (also known as a salt pan or salt flat) is a flat area of ground covered with salt and other minerals. They are usually purely white. They are found in desert areas. In areas where salt plains form, the rate of evaporation (how quickly water dries up) is faster than the rate of precipitation (how often rain falls). A salt plain is formed where a lake or pond would otherwise be found. When the water dries up, the minerals stay left behind on the suface of the ground. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) build up on the surface."
"Large salt plains are common in the Sahara Desert, the Kalahari Desert, the Rann of Kutch, the western United States and the central deserts of Australia. The Altiplano in Bolivia has the world's largest salt plan, the Salar de Uyuni."
Witchetty grub
"A witchetty grub (also spelled witchety grub or witjuti grub) is the large, white larva of a moth. It is a name used in Australia. Normally, it refers to the larvae of the cossid moth ""Endoxyla leucomochla"", found in central Australia. These moths eat the roots of the witchetty bush (a plant named after the grubs). It is also sometimes used to refer to the larvae of other cossid moths, as well as those of ghost moths (Hepialidae). It is used mainly when the larvae are being thought of as food. Because it contains a lot of protein, the grub is the most important insect food of the desert. It was a staple in the diets of nomadic Aboriginal people living in the outback."
"The name ""witchetty"" (or ""witjuti"") comes from the Adnyamathanha language. The name comes from the words ""wityu"" (meaning ""hooked stick"") and ""vartu"" (meaning ""grub"")."

Abortion laws
"Abortion laws specify under what circumstances a woman can get an abortion. Getting an abortion means that the pregnancy is ended early, without the birth of a child. These laws vary widely, by country, and sometimes by area. They have also changed over time."
"As of 2022, about 60% of the people live in a country that allows abortion, under some circumstances. When abortion is legal, it may mean that only part of the reasons are recognized, or that it is only legal for part of the pregnany."
Options for regulation.
"Generally, there are the following options, from the most liberal, to the most restrictive, when a pregancy can be ended:"
Common reasons for allowing an abortion:
Discussions about abortion.
"Abortion is a controversial subject in many societies: People argue in favor or arganist it, using argumrnts from religion, moral and ethical values, or practical or political reasons. Note that legally outlawing abortions will not stop people from getting an abortion: They may get an unsafe abortion, which is riskier than a legal abortion. A study done in 2007 found that abortion rates were similar in countries where abortion was legal, and those countries where it wasn't. Very often, people get an abortion, because they do not have easy access to modern contraceptives. According to the same study, the number of abortions is decreasing, because contraceptives are more commonly available."
Timeline.
"The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of July 2022, 65 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request."
"Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included (e.g., leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States). Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved."
Johann Adolf Hasse
"Johann Adolf Hasse (also spelled Johann Adolph Hasse; baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was a German composer, singer, and music teacher. He was an important opera composer in the 18th century."
Life.
Early career.
"Hasse was born in Bergedorf, near Hamburg. His father and grandfather were organists. He studied in Hamburg from 1714 to 1717. In 1718 he joined the Hamburg State Opera. He was a tenor singer. In 1719, he started working in Brunswick. He performed operas written by Georg Schürmann, Francesco Conti and Antonio Caldara. His own opera, ""Antioco"", was performed in Brunswick in 1721. It is his only opera which is written in the German language."
"He might have left Germany in 1722. He went to Naples. In Naples, he converted (changed his religion) to Catholicism. He studied writing music and counterpoint with Alessandro Scarlatti. Hasse's first opera in Italy was ""Il Sesotrate"". It was performed on 13 May 1726. The opera was a success. It made him a famous composer and musician."
Dresden and Venice.
"In 1730 Hasse visited Venice. He married Faustina Bordoni, an opera singer. His opera ""Artaserse"" was performed there. It was his first opera which uses Metastasio's text. The opera was a success."
"He became the ""Kapellmeister"" of the Dresden court in around 1730. He arrived at Dresden in 1731. His employer was King August II of Poland. He wrote operas and church music in Dresden. In Dresden, he wrote the opera ""Cleofide"". The opera uses text by Metastasio. Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach may have watched the opera's first performance. On the next day, Bach performed on the organ. Hasse might have watched Bach play the organ. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach said that his father and Hasse were good friends."
"As part of his job, Hasse did not have to stay in Dresden. From 1733 to 1734 he stayed in Italy. He wrote music for the Ospedale degli Incurabili, an orphanage in Venice. He also went to Vienna. He taught Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria how to sing. Hasse came back to Dresden in December 1733. He wrote new operas. He also wrote some church music. In 1734, the king of Poland went to Warsaw. Hasse went back to Italy. He stayed in Italy until 1737."

"Wine making begins with growing red or white grapes. Wine grapes have thicker skins and bigger seeds compared to table grapes for eating. After the grapes are ripe, they are picked off the plants. There are different ways of picking (for example, using machines, or picking by hand, in the day, or at night)."
"After harvest, the grapes are crushed to release their juice, which is very sugary. Before, this was done by people stomping on grapes with their bare feet. Today, machines are used, but people sometimes use their bare feet in festivals. The person making the wine also decides now if the wine will be red, white, or rose:"
"Next, the sweet grape juice is fermented, by adding yeast. In a few days, the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol, and also releases carbon dioxide."
"After fermenting, the wine is stored for a while (called ""aging""). The person making the wine can make different choices, which will change the flavor of the wine. They can choose to store the wine in a steel container, or a barrel made of oak wood. If they choose wood, the wine will absorb some of the wood flavor, which wine drinkers call ""oakiness"". This process can take only a couple of weeks, up to several years, depending on what kind of flavor the wine maker wants."
"Lastly, the wine is bottled and sent to a customer, restaurant or store to be enjoyed."
Wine and people.
People have been making wine for about 5000 years.

Water
"Water () is a transparent, tasteless, odourless, and almost colourless chemical substance and covers over 70% of Earth's surface. No known life can live without it."
"Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very cold (below ), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very hot (above ), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor. It is moved around in the water cycle. Water is essential for life."
Physical chemistry of water.
"Water is a fluid. Water is the only chemical substance on Earth that exists naturally in three states. There are over 40 anomalies (strange things) about water. Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water freezes, it expands by about 9%. This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes."
Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O.
"Like other liquids, water has a surface tension, so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface."
"Things having something to do with water may have ""hydro"" or ""aqua"" in their name, such as hydropower or aquarium, from the Greek and Latin names for water. It is also called the ""universal solvent"", because it dissolves many other compounds."
"In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color."
Uses of water.
"Plants and animals (including people) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place, and is the main part of blood. It keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin. Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive. Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body. Saliva, which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make urine. Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water, but this value differs with age; i.e. a foetus is 95% water inside."
"Water is the main component of drinks like milk, juice, and wine. Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients, things like sugar, fruit, and sometimes alcohol. Water that a person can drink is called ""potable water"" (or ""drinking water""). The water in oceans is salt water, but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water."
"Many places, including cities and deserts, don't have as much water as people want. They build aqueducts to bring water there."
"Though people can survive a few months without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few desert animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink."
"Water has no smell, taste, or color."
Besides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions. He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon.
Meyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe. This is why some people hated him.
Meyerbeer’s reputation after his death.
"Meyerbeer’s operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century, but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion. From 1933 to 1945 his music was banned in Germany by the Nazis because he was Jewish. Today there is some interest again, but nothing like the huge popularity he had in his lifetime."
Grand opera
"Grand Opera is a term which is used to describe an opera with continuous music. It is a kind of opera that was popular in the 19th-century. Grand operas are usually divided into four or five acts. There have large casts (many singers taking part) and large orchestras. There is a lot of scenery. The story is dramatic. It is usually a story about a hero from history. The term ""Grand Opera"" has often been used to describe the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850, and sometimes to describe the Paris Opéra itself."
"In a broader sense ""Grand Opera"" can be any large-scale opera from European countries. During the 1830s and 1840s Giacomo Meyerbeer was thought to be the greatest composer of Grand Opera."
Lake Lucerne
"Lake Lucerne is a lake in central Switzerland. It is the fourth largest lake in the country. The German name is Vierwaldstättersee which means: ""Lake of the Four Forested Cantons""."
It is possible to travel all the way round the side of the lake by road. There are several tunnels on the way. It is very popular with tourists. There are many hotels by the lake.
Die Feen
"Die Feen (""The Fairies"") is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. The German libretto was written by the composer. He was adapting a story by Carlo Gozzi called ""La donna serpente""."
"""Die Feen"" was the first opera that Wagner finished. However, it was never performed during his lifetime. It has never become popular, although the overture is sometimes played. The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time. It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas. The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories. The idea of being saved (redemption) is also an important idea that he used in later operas."
Rienzi
"Rienzi is an opera by Richard Wagner. Its full title is Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen (""Rienzi, the Last of the Tribunes""). It is one of the earliest operas Wagner wrote. There are five acts. Wagner wrote the libretto himself, using the story from a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It was composed between 1838 and 1840 It was first performed at the Hofoper, Dresden on 20 October 1842. It was the first time Wagner had a success as an opera composer."
Story.
"The story of the opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzi (1313–1354), a medieval Italian populist figure who manages to trick the nobles and their followers. He helps the people to get power. At first he is very popular, but then he has to use force against the nobles, and the Church turns against him. In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering."
Chess tournament
A chess tournament is a competition between chess players. It can take one of these forms:
"Since the first international chess tournament in London, 1851, chess tournaments have become the standard form of chess competition among serious players. Currently, FIDE holds candidates tournaments every two years to determine challenger to the world champion."
"In 1851, Adolf Anderssen became first unofficial champion. In 1858, Paul Morphy beat him and became second unofficial champion. In 1871, Johannez Zukertort defeated Adolf Anderssen to become third unofficial chess champion. There are three unofficial world chess champions: Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Johannes Zukertort, stemming from first strong international tournament in London in 1851, won by Anderssen."
The Flying Dutchman
"Der fliegende Holländer (""The Flying Dutchman"") is an opera by Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote the libretto himself. The story comes from the legend of the ""Flying Dutchman"", which is about the captain of a ship. It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea, without ever going on to land, until Judgment Day."
"The most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love. It was a favourite idea of Wagner, who used it a lot in his later operas."
"Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843. It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style. It is very different from the previous opera ""Rienzi"" which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing. In ""Der fliegende Holländer"" the drama is very important. Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture. We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with."
"Wagner originally wrote ""Der fliegende Holländer"" to be performed without any breaks (intermission). Sometimes it is performed like that today, but Wagner also made a version with three acts."

The China Syndrome
"The China Syndrome is a disaster movie about a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant. It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term ""China syndrome"" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth ""all the way to China""."
Plot summary.
"News reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team."
Response of the nuclear power industry.
"Upon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as ""sheer fiction"" and a ""character assassination of an entire industry"". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels."

Gusinje
"Gusinje (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Гусиње, ), is a small town and municipality in north-eastern Montenegro. In 2011, it has a population of 4,027 people. The town is located in a very thin valley and it is surrounded by mountains. This is due to its location in the Plav-Gusinje valley. The majority of the population are Muslim and profess Islam.

Isaac Newton was the first person to solve to the general two-body problem.
Three or more bodies.
"Looking at the generalizations, there are two other problems which are related:"
Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution was proposed in Congress on December 9, 1803. It was ratified by the state legislatures on June 15, 1804. It provided new procedures for electing the President and Vice President. Before the amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast a single vote. The candidate who received the largest number of votes became the President. The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes became the Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment changed the process to the current system whereby one vote is cast for the President and one for the Vice President."
Background.
"The Constitutional Convention of 1787 went over several different proposals for electing the President. Some wanted Congress to choose the President. Other suggestions included selection by the state legislatures, by the state governors or by a congressional committee. Near the end of the convention the question was turned over to a committee called the Committee of Eleven for leftover business. They devised a system called the Electoral College. The plan was accepted and was added to the Constitution."
"In 1789 the Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first president. He was reelected in 1792. In both cases he was the only president to receive all of the electoral votes. In the 1796 election, Washington declined to run. His Vice President, John Adams, and his running mate Thomas Pinckney ran for President and Vice President respectively. Alexander Hamilton tried to use his influence to get Pinckney more votes, making Adams the Vice President again. But the scheme backfired when Thomas Jefferson got more votes than Pinckney, but Adams won more of the electoral votes. This made Adams the President and Jefferson the Vice President."
"The 1800 Presidential election showed the deep problems in the electoral college system. Jefferson ran against Adams again. Both had running mates. Pinckney was again the running mate of Adams for the Federalist Party. Aaron Burr was Jefferson's running mate for the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes creating a tie between two candidates from the same political party. Under the Constitution, the matter was to be decided by the House of Representatives. In the House, the two tied again in 35 votes. Only on the 36th ballot was the deadlock broken and Jefferson was elected president."
"The solution to the problem became the Twelfth Amendment. It was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803. Three days later it was submitted to the states for ratification. Fourteen of the seventeen states (at the time) ratified it and the amendment was added to the Constitution on September 25, 1804."
Provisions.
"The Electoral College remained much the same under the Twelfth Amendment. But the process for choosing a president and vice president changed. Under the Twelfth Amendment an elector must cast separate votes for the President and Vice President. If nobody gets the majority of the votes, the process remains the same as before; the House of Representatives decides."

SXSW Interactive.
"SXSW Interactive is about new technology. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator. According to a festival organizer Louis Black, SXSW Interactive ""has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world"" since 2007."
British Armed Forces
"The British Armed Forces are the armed forces of the United Kingdom. The British Armed Forces are officially called Her Majesty's Armed Forces, and they are sometimes called the Armed Forces of the Crown. The British Armed Forces is made up of three parts: the British Army, the Royal Navy (and the Royal Marines) and the Royal Air Force."
"The Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces is the British monarch. Members of the British Armed Forces must swear that they will obey the orders of the monarch (swear allegiance). Under the constitution of the United Kingdom, the armed forces controlled by the Crown, however, because of the 1689 Bill of Rights, the UK cannot have an army during peacetime unless the British Parliament allows it. Nowadays, the British Parliament passes an Armed Forces Act every five years, which means the UK can keep its military. The British Prime Minister is the ""de facto"" commander of the British Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=""United Kingdom 05/06""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence."
"The British Armed Forces protect the United Kingdom, the British overseas territories and the Crown dependencies. They also take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The British Armed Forces often take part in NATO missions. The most recent wars the British Armed Forces have fought are the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Operation Palliser, peacekeeping in the Balkans and Cyprus, and defending the no-fly zone over Libya. The British Armed Forces have bases in the following places: Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Qatar and the Sovereign Base Areas (Cyprus)."
"The United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon in Operation Hurricane in 1952. , Britain is one of the five recognised nuclear powers. It has around 225 nuclear warheads. The United Kingdom's nuclear weapons are controlled by the Royal Navy."
Christina Onassis
"Christina Onassis (December 11, 1950 – November 19, 1988) was a Greek-Argentine businesswoman and socialite. She was the heiress to the Onassis family fortune. She was the only daughter of Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman, and Athina Livanos."
"Onassis was born at LeRoy Sanitarium in New York City, United States, but she gave up her American citizenship. She had a brother, Alexander Onassis. Her daughter, by Thierry Roussel, is Athina Onassis Roussel (named after Christina's mother). Christina died in Buenos Aires from a heart attack. She was aged 37. Her heart attack was caused by pulmonary edema."
Athina Onassis
"Athina Onassis Roussel (alternate: Athina Onassis de Miranda; born 28 January 1985) is a French-Greek heiress. Her grandfather was Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman. She is his only living descendant. Her mother was Christina Onassis. Athina inherited her grandfather's fortune when her mother died in 1988."
"Roussel was born at American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She is the eldest of Thierry Roussel's four children. She is a horse rider."
Arrogance
"Arrogance (also called hubris) indicates strong pride or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with reality and overestimating one's own competence or capability."
It is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines.
Arrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. Children raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves.
"Arrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded culture. Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work."
Arrogance is different from confidence. Arrogance may be associated with insecurity. Confidence has an association with improving and examining one's own weaknesses.
"Hubris is the ancient Greek concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as ""pride"". Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris."
Steven Yeun
"Steven Yeun (born December 21, 1983) is a South Korean,American actor, voice actor and Singer. He is most well known for his role as ""Glenn"" in the AMC original series ""The Walking Dead"".

Dawson College shooting
"The Dawson College shooting was a school shooting on September 13, 2006. It took place at the Dawson College in Montreal, Quebec, Canada."
"Kimveer Gill, a twenty-five year old Indo-Canadian, shot 20 people and killed 1 person as well as himself (suicide) after being shot in the arm by a police officer."
"Gill had a Vampirefreaks.com profile and mentioned the song ""À Tout le Monde"" by thrash metal band Megadeth on the day of the shooting. News outlets blamed Megadeth for the shooting. Later in 2006, Megadeth performed a live concert in Montreal and responded to the blame they and their music received. Lead singer and guitarist Dave Mustaine said to the crowd:"
Mustaine was also interviewed by CBC News before Megadeth's concert and said :
The attack.
Some people get strep throat more often than others. Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat. Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils. Waiting is also appropriate.
Treatment.
"Strep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment. Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker. The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness. For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms."
Pain medication.
"Medicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat. These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen. Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine. Aspirin may be used in adults. It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome."
Antibiotic medicine.
"Penicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat. It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money. Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe. In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever. Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment. The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms. The average length is three to five days. Antibiotics lowers this by about one day. These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness. The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications. These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections. The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects. Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication. Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads. The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin. Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies. Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis). Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition."
Outlook.
"The symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses. They also make it harder to spread the illness. Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics."
These very bad problems might be caused by strep throat:
Likelihood.
Strep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis. About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year. Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses. The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children. It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults. Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring.

Vichy France
"The Vichy France or the French State was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine. It also governed the French colonial empire. It was led by Philippe Pétain, notable for helping to win World War I. When the French and British armies lost the Battle of Dunkirk and the rest of the Battle of France was being lost, the French Parliament made him Prime Minister. He negotiated an armistice with the Germans, agreeing to be neutral in World War II. Pétain became Head of State, effectively dictator, and usually did what the Germans told him to do."
"The Axis powers militarily occupied northern France and part of the southeast. The Vichy government, as a client state of Germany, controlled the ""Free Zone"" or unoccupied parts of France until November1942. The German army ran the Northern half. In 1944, the Vichy government, now effectively a puppet state, moved to Nazi Germany, and later disbanded. It became known as Vichy France after World War II."
Anguilla
Anguilla is a group of five islands in the Caribbean Sea. The islands are ruled by the United Kingdom.
"Anguilla was colonized by the British Empire and used to be part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis, but broke away in 1980 so it could stay part of Great Britain. Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent."
"It is named after the Spanish word for ""eel"", because it has such a shape."
Anguilla was first settled by Arawakan-speaking Indians who called it Malliouhana.
Politics.
"The King or Queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a governor. He or she names, or ""appoints"" the governor, and he is just working there in place of the monarch. The legislature is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly."
Economy.
"Anguilla has mostly been part of the British Empire since the 17th century. The British brought thousands of slaves from Africa and forced them to work, like they did all over the Caribbean and North America. Many of the slaves decided to run away rather than be forced to work. When the British decided to abolish slavery they paid all the slave owners a lot of money, but didn't give anything to the slaves. Now Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism."
Culture.
"Most people in Anguilla are Protestants, and speak English."

History.
"in 1505 by Spanish navigator Juan de Bermúdez (who said it to be inhabited only with pigs), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas."
Geography.
"The country is in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea. It is about 580 nautical miles (1070 km, 670 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 590 nautical miles (1100 km, 690 mi) southeast of Martha's Vineyard. The island is due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina. It has 103 km (64 mi) of coastline."
"The territory has 181 islands. The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 sq mi). The largest island is ""Main Island"", sometimes itself called ""Bermuda""."
Climate.
"Bermuda has a subtropical climate. The weather is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around The temperature rarely drops below 10 °C"
Bermuda is very likely to be affected by hurricanes. The island's small size means that direct landfalls are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003.
The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall. It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.
Flora and fauna.
"When discovered, Bermuda had no people. It was mostly covered by forests of Bermuda cedar, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 vascular plant species are considered native. Of those 15, including the cedar, are endemic."
"Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda. Coconut palms grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species. While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit."
"The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats. All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ""Lasionycteris noctivagans"", ""Lasiurus borealis"", ""Lasiurus cinereus"", ""Lasiurus seminolus"" and ""Perimyotis subflavus"". Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the Bermuda Petrel, and the Bermuda Rock Skink. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of terrapin predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago."
"Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory is the Northern Territory Government agency which aim for tasks such as the establishment of ""parks, reserves, sanctuaries and other land"", the management of these and the ""protection, conservation, sustainable use of wildlife etc."

Game of Death Redux
"Game of Death Redux (死亡遊戲 Redux) is a 2019 special features distributed with the movie ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"""
Background.
"In 1978 the ""Golden Harvest"" has released ""Game of Death"" (""死亡遊戲""). The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot. The revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original ""The Game of Death (1972)""."
Creation of special feature.
"But on 2019 producer ""Alan Canvan"" edited ""Game of Death Redux"". The edit only uses footage shot during the original production of ""The Game of Death"". The movie was released as a special feature in ""The Criterion Collection's"" Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020."
"It was presented closely the way Bruce intended. While at the same time, keeping in-tact some of the stronger as aspects of the universally panned, pieced together 1978 movie (known to fans as Game of Death ’78), such as John Barry’s acclaimed score, as well some of the film’s strong audio design."
New Version on 2022.
"There is a second version of ""Game of Death Redux"" on 2022."
"With the first version Alan Canvan had concentrated entirely on the flow of the piece. But he was not satisfied to how the shots were cut and how the music drove the narrative artistically. Canvan wanted a complete visual and sound restoration. So he got help from a new team. After a year the new Redux has been fully restored with a brand-new color grade and audio mix. Additionally, Chris Kent, who looped Bruce’s war cries for Robert Clouse’s Game of Death movie, lent his voice once again to match the audio portions from 1978. Finally, reworking a dozen sequences resulted in a much more concise and dramatic presentation of the narrative."
Legacy.
"Canvan’s Game of Death Redux was the latest project that focused on Bruce Lee’s original 1972 storyline, a subject that was previously explored in John Little’s 2000 documentary, and Artport’s Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 (released in Japan the same year), not to mention a series of fan edits that have been circulating the internet. All aforementioned edits use 1972-era The Game of Death footage that was initially discovered by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan, who stumbled upon the footage in the now-defunct Golden Harvest studio vaults back in 1999."
The Game of Death.
"The Game of Death (""死亡的遊戲"") is an incomplete ""Hong Kong"" martial arts film, of 39 minutes (approximatley two minutes is missing from the beginning), filmed in 1972, directed, written, produced by and starring ""Bruce Lee"", as Hai Tien, with ""Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"", as Mantis, ""James Tien"", ""Chieh Yuan"", ""Dan Inosanto"", ""Ji Han-jae"" and ""Hwang In-shik"" (only a short footage outdoors). Unifinished because of Bruce Lee's death. Produced company ""Concord Production Inc."" and ""Golden Harvest"". The 1972 original footage it was distributed in 2000 by two documentaries, """" and "" Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯"" and 2019 by short film ""Game of Death Redux"". The 1972 original script it was distributed by short film ""The Story""."
Plot.
"During a search is discovered among the choreography writings, hand-written storyline, 12 pages in length and containing all scene breakdowns and select dialogue passages the original storyline stands in sharp contrast to the one presented in the film ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"". After the discovery of Lee's script notes in 2000 it was directed the short film ""The Story"". The movie is the storyline for ""The Game of Death"" and the missing part of ""Bruce Lees ""The Game of Death"", not played in 1972. Directed in ""South Korea"" by ""John Little"", distributed as a special feature in DVD of the documentary '."

Religion.
"Sweden has been Christian for a thousand years. Sweden is traditionally a Protestant country, but it is now one of the least religious countries in the world. Statistical surveys say 46-85% of all people in Sweden are agnostics or atheists. This means that they doubt or they do not believe in the existence of a god. About 6.4 million people in Sweden, which is 67% of all the people, are members of the Church of Sweden, but only 2% of members go to church often."

Sweden (men and women's teams combined) has five bronze medals and two silver medals from the World Cup in football (soccer). The soccer league in Sweden is called Allsvenskan (men's) and Damallsvenskan (women's). Sweden has also performed well in ice hockey. The men's ice hockey top division in Sweden is called SHL and the women's SDHL. Sweden has also had several successful table tennis players, including Stellan Bengtsson and Jan-Ove Waldner, as well as alpine skiers including Ingemar Stenmark, Pernilla Wiberg, and Anja Pärson. Other champions include biathlete Magdalena Forsberg and tennis players Björn Borg, Mats Wilander, Stefan Edberg, and Jonas Björkman. Swimmer Sara Sjöström has several gold, silver and bronze medals from the Olympic Games and holds several world records."
"Sweden also succeeds in cross-country skiing, having won several medals in the Olympic Games."

Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born American scientist. He worked on theoretical physics. He developed the theory of relativity. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.
"His famous equation is formula_1 (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light (energy = mass × speed of light²)."
"At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he made the theory of special relativity to fix it."
"Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916, he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation."
"In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States but in Germany, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power (this is before World War II). Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies. He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that the U.S. should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the U.S. became the first nation in history to create and use the atomic bomb (not on Germany but on Japan). Einstein and other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on the Manhattan Project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan."
"Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of his life."
He is now thought to be one of the greatest scientists of all time.
"His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity."
Life.
Early life.
"Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, on 14 March 1879. His family was Jewish, but was not very . However, later in life Einstein became very interested in his Judaism. Einstein did not begin speaking until he was 3 years old. According to his younger sister, Maja, ""He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn"". When Einstein was around 4 years old, his father gave him a magnetic compass. He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to move itself so that it always pointed north. The needle was in a closed case, so clearly nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around, and yet it moved. So in this way Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics. His compass gave him ideas to the world of science."
"When he became older, he went to school in Switzerland. After he graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote the papers that first made him famous as a great scientist."
Einstein married with a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić in January 1903.
"In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him, fortunately he survived. His cousin Elsa Löwenthal nursed him back to health. After this happened, Einstein divorced Mileva in 14 February 1919, and married Elsa on 2 June 1919."
Children.
"Einstein's first daughter was Lieserl Einstein. She was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Austria-Hungary on January 27, 1902. She spent her first years in the care of Serbian grandparents because her father Albert did not want her to be brought to Switzerland, where he had a job offer at the patent office. Some historians believe she died from scarlet fever."
Transport.
"Abergavenny railway station is a train station on the Welsh Marches line. Passengers at the station can board direct trains to places such as Hereford, Shrewsbury, Manchester, Chester, Wrexham, Holyhead, Cardiff, Swansea and Carmarthen."

He co-founded the punk rock band The Damned, first playing bass before switching to guitar. He is best known for a UK number one hit with his cover of ""Happy Talk"" in 1982. He often wears a red beret and sunglasses."
"Burns was born in Balham, London. He is married and has four children."

It started from November 26, 2014 in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine ""Comp Ace""."
"There is an anime television series based on this light novel by Madhouse. It has 3 seasons with 13 episodes each. The first season aired from July 7 to September 29, 2015. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018 and the third season from July 10, 2018 to October 2, 2018. The scriptwriter for the anime series said that the fourth season of the series was ""extremely likely"" to be produced."

"Faye Alicia Brookes (born 3 September 1987) is an English actress. She is known for portraying the role of Kate Connor in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street, a role he has playing since 2015 to 2019."
"Brookes was born in Manchester, Greater Manchester, England."
Draize test
"The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a ""wash out"" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site."
"The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that ""to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test"". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects ""in vitro"" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out."
Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs.
Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane
"The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product ot be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pein during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing."
Social choice theory
"Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision. Usually this is done by combining and aggregating the opinion of each member of the group. A classic problem of social choice theory is that of holding an election or a popular vote."
Year of the Three Emperors
"The Year of the Three Emperors, or the Year of the Three Kaisers, () refers to the year 1888 during the German Empire in German history. The year is important because two German Emperors, or Kaisers, died. This meant that there were three emperors in a year.. The three emperors who ruled Germany during this year were Wilhelm I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. The mnemonic “""drei Achten, drei Kaiser""” (English: ""three eights, three emperors"") is still used today in Germany to remember which year it was."
"The high-altitude ""Polylepis"" forests and woodlands are found in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees are called Queñua, Yagual and other names. They grow at altitudes of above sea level. It is still unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan time. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has had a faster pace, and the trees are now endangered. Some think as little as 10% of the original woodland is still here."
Wildlife.
"The Andes has a lot of wildlife. With almost 1,000 species, of which about 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians."
"Animal diversity in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptiles (45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (1/3 endemic)."
"The Vicuña and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, live in the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers. Other animals found in the mostly open habitats of the high Andes are the huemul, cougar, and foxes in the genus ""Pseudalopex"". And for birds, some species of tinamous (they are members of the genus ""Nothoprocta""), are the Andean Goose, Giant Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), Lesser Rhea, Andean Flicker, Diademed Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches."
Meal
"A meal is a serving of food eaten by human beings. Meals usually include several different types of food, such as grains, vegetables, fruit, and in some cases, meat. Meals have different names by time they are taken or by the type of food that is eaten."
Types.
"In North America and in Europe, people usually eat three meals a day. The morning meal is called breakfast. It usually includes foods made from grain (cereal, porridge, or bread), fruit (apple, banana, or an orange), and milk products (milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese). Many people drink coffee or tea with their breakfast."
"Around noon, people eat their lunch. People who are working at jobs are given a break to eat their lunch. The lunch meal includes foods such as a sandwich, soup, vegetables, fruit, and milk. In some countries, such as Italy, people serve an alcoholic drink with lunch. In England, some people have a glass of beer with their lunch."
"In the evening, people eat their supper or dinner. Dinners are different in different countries. Usually dinners include a ""main course"" such as roast beef, a grain (such as rice or pasta), a vegetable (such as carrots or cauliflower) and a dessert (called a ""sweet"" or ""pudding"" in England)."
"In some cases, a starter or appetizer is served before the dinner. Appetizers are a small serving of food such as olives, cheese, or bread. In many countries, people serve an alcoholic drink with dinner, such as wine or beer."
Leipzig
"Leipzig (Upper Saxon: ""Leibzsch"" or ""Leibz'sch"") is the biggest city in the state of Saxony (eastern Germany). When Germany was divided into East and West Germany, Leipzig was one of the three biggest industrial cities in the East Germany."
"Leipzig occupies and is still an industrial city. 510,651 people are living in Leipzig as of 29 February 2008."
History.
"Its Latin name is ""Lipsia"" and the German name ""Leipzig"" came from this name. Leipzig has a long history. Its name was first recorded as Leipzig Castle (Leipziger Burg) in 1015, and the official founding of the city occurred later in 1165. It was an economic center of , famous with its market (Leipziger Messe)."

"In 1813 near Leipzig, the Battle of Leipzig was fought between the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte and the allied armies of Austria, Prussia and Russia."
"In 1839, the railway between Dresden and Leipzig was opened. It was the first long distance railroad in Germany."
"As a result of industrialization, the number of people living in Leipzig grew during the 19th century. Before World War II, there were about 750,000 people in Leipzig."
"After the war, Leipzig belonged to the part of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union, and later to East Germany."
"In 1989, the took place in Leipzig. Every monday after a Christian mess in the the Leipzig people demonstrate for freedom to travel and democracy. These demonstrations became bigger and bigger and reached their peak on 23 October when 320,000 people came. The demonstrations are one of the things that lead to the end of communist dictatorship in East Germany."
"Today, Leipzig is still known as a city of fairs, media and university, but is less important than it was before World War II."
Economy.
"Before World War II, Leipzig was a famous center of commerce (Leipzig exhibition) and industry. Now, there are big companies in Leipzig like Porsche, BMW, Siemens and DHL, as well as the ."
Population.
"With almost 511,000 people, Leipzig city proper is the 12th biggest city in Germany and the 2nd biggest in what was East Germany (DDR), smaller than East Berlin and bigger than Dresden. Leipzig urban has 567,000 people. The total population of Leipzig metropolitan area is 1,389,000."
Geography.
"You is a second-person English pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person. Sometimes, just using the English letter ""u"" is acceptable, and ""ur"" for the words ""you're"" and ""your"". This is very informal, and is mostly used in texting."
Yard (disambiguation)
A yard is a unit of length in some measuring systems.

Chinese language
The Chinese language is the group of languages used by Chinese people in China and elsewhere. It forms part of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
"Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue and Min. These are not mutually intelligible and many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages."
"'Chinese' can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use the same writing system. Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing. Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the Soviet Union, using one official language so people can understand each other. The Standard Chinese language is referred to as Mandarin in English, ""Pǔtōnghuà"" or ""common to everybody speech"" in mainland China and ""Guóyǔ"" or ""language of the whole country"" in Taiwan. All official documents in Pinyin are written in Mandarin and Mandarin is taught all over China. It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries."
"Chinese is used by the Han people in China and other ethnic groups in China who are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Many people in autonomous regions of China speak other languages. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. They also give ""some"" indication of pronunciation, but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese. Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, people in places far from each other say them differently, just as ""1, 2, 3"" can be read differently in different languages."
"Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu Pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters."
All the Chinese languages (or dialects) use tones. This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear.
Different languages or dialects of Chinese.
"The Chinese language is like a big tree. The base of the tree started thousands of years ago. It now has several main limbs. Some people call ""just a branch"" what other people call a main limb, so you can say there are six or seven main limbs. Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain, the United States, Australia, India, and so forth. Just as the Romance languages all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin, the Chinese languages all have some common source, so they keep many common things among them."
Here are the main seven main groups of languages/dialects of Chinese by size:
Traditional and simplified characters.
"In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. The Japanese language uses them even more often. These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji."
"A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. However, people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper—but they will have to guess some less-used words."
Examples.
"Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it."
"The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters."
"Before 1956, Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters. At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all. The government of the People's Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand. They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write. Today, many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters."
Zero
"Zero (0) is a special number. If there are zero things, then there is nothing at all. For example, if a person has zero hats, that means they do not have any hats."
Symbol.
"The symbol for the number zero is ""0"". It is the additive identity of common numbers. This means that if a number is added to 0, then that number would remain unchanged."
Math with zero.
3 + 0 = 3
3 − 0 = 3
0 − 3 = −3
"While the movie is widely said to be a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the movie was first released."
Awards and honors.
"In the scene where Lamarr talks to his band of bad guys, he says, ""You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!"" Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nomination. The movie did receive three other Academy Awards nominations in 1974: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Madeline Kahn, Best Film Editing, and Best Music, Original Song. The movie also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay."
"The movie won the Writers Guild of America Award for ""Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen"" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger."
"In 2006, ""Blazing Saddles"" was chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry."
Alexander Rybak
"Alexander Rybak (13 May 1986) is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer, composer and violinist. He was born in Minsk, Belarusian SSR. He moved to Norway when he was four. He is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Fairytale"" for Norway. Rybak went to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo to perform his winning entry from the previous year."
Pika
"A pika is a small mammal related to the hare and the rabbit (lagomorph). Pikas are also known as rock rabbits or coneys. Pikas have short limbs, a round body, an even coat of fur, round ears, and no external tail."
"There are 37 different species of pika. Most pikas live in colder climates, on rocky mountain slopes. Pikas need cold temperatures to live, and can die if exposed to temperatures above . They live in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. They are active during the day or twilight. Pikas do not hibernate. Because they do not hibernate, during the summer they gather food for winter. They collect hay, which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. Predators, like ferrets, and large birds often use these disputes to catch pikas."
"Pikas are herbivores and eat many kinds of plants, such as grasses, sedges, moss, and lichens."
Pikas in Eurasia often live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. Pikas in North America are asocial outside of breeding season.
Pikachu from Pokemon is based off this animal.
Two-source hypothesis
"The Two-source hypothesis is a hypothesis that was made in the 19th century. It tries to explain what is called the synoptic problem in Christian theology. This problem is that certain parts of the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke have texts that are very similar. The hypothesis claims that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written based on the gospel of Mark, and lost source text, called Q. The Q is for German ""Quelle"", and means source. The lost document was likely a collection of Jesus' sayings, very probably written in Ancient Greek. The hypothesis is widely accepted among Christian scholars."
Problems.
There are two major problems with this hypothesis:
Favicon
A favicon is small image (known as an icon) that is used to identify a website or webpage.
"This type of icon (also known as a favorite icon or favorites icon) is usually a square image that is only 16 pixels in height and 16 pixels in width. However, modern browsers, especially those installed on smartphones, can display bigger favicons that are 32 pixels or 64 pixels in size. And when a favicon is included in a webpage it can be seen next to a browser's address bar, inside a browser's tab or in the browser's Favorites' or Bookmarks' list."
Henry Rollins
"Henry Rollins (born February 13, 1961 in Washington D.C.) is an American singer, writer and actor. After a few wild years in the punk rock band Black Flag, he started his own metal band, the Rollins Band. Rollins is now a solo artist. He often tours in many countries performing spoken-word concerts."
Tay-Sachs disease
Tay-Sachs disease (also called Tray-Sachs syndrome) is a disease that causes problems with the metabolism of fat. Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A.
"Tay-Sachs is a genetic disease. It happens when Chromosome 15 has a genetic problem. The problem is caused by a defective HEXA gene. It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In the 1800’s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5."
"Infants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay–Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the ""startle response"". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease."

North East MRT line
The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.
"The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations."
"This line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track."
All the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line.
Stations.
"The Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast. Construction will begin in 2018, and it is expected to open in 2023."
List of Singapore MRT stations
"The following lists all rail stations of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in Singapore, with underground stations listed in ""italics"". There are 151 stations in operation. Many more are in various stages of planning and construction (as shown in the latest system map)."
At bat
"In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is used for certain statistics. These statistics include batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage. It is a more narrow definition of a plate appearance. A batter starts with an at bat every time he faces a pitcher; however, the batter gets ""no time at bat"" in the following cases:"
Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of Major League Baseball defines an at bat as:
"""Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction..."""
Examples.
An at bat is counted when:
Cal Ripken Jr.
"Calvin Edwin ""Cal"" Ripken, Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed ""Iron Man"", is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played his whole 21-year baseball career for the Baltimore Orioles (1981–2001)."
"Ripken is perhaps best known for breaking New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. The record had been called too hard to break. He beat the 56-year-old record when he played in his 2,131st straight game on September 6, 1995 between the Orioles and the California Angels in front of a sold-out crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Ripken hit a home run in the game the night before that tied Gehrig's record and another home run in his 2,131st game. Fans later voted this game as Major League Baseball's ""Most Memorable Moment"" in MLB history. Ripken played in an 501 more straight games over the next three years. His streak ended at 2,632 games when he removed his name from the lineup for the final Orioles home game of the 1998 season. His record 2,632 straight games lasted over seventeen seasons, from May 30, 1982 to September 20, 1998."
"A 19-time All-Star and member of the 3000 hit club, Ripken is considered one of the best shortstops and third basemen to ever play the game. At 6' 4"" (1.93 m), 225 lbs. (102.27 kg), he led the way for taller, larger shortstops to be successful in that position. When voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he was a first ballot inductee with the third highest voting percentage (98.53%) in Hall of Fame history, behind Tom Seaver (98.84%) and Nolan Ryan (98.79%)."
"He is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc. The company's goal is to grow the love of baseball from a more grassroots level. Established in 2001, Ripken Baseball represents Cal and his brother Bill's business and philanthropy dealings and focuses on several subsidiaries: Ripken Management and Design, Youth Camps and Clinics, Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation, Ripken Professional Baseball, with three minor-league teams—the Aberdeen IronBirds (affiliated with the Orioles); the Augusta GreenJackets (affiliated with the San Francisco Giants); and the Charlotte Stone Crabs (affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays)—and Ironclad Authentics."
"On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the suggested Constitution. All 30 of the members of its Convention voted for the Constitution."
"On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution. Now that nine states had ratified the Constitution, it became the highest and most important law of the United States. The United States would have a new form of government, based on the ideas set out in the Constitution."
Four states are still left.
"However, four states still had not approved the Constitution. These states were Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. If they did not approve the Constitution, they would not be a part of the new government of the United States."
"The Congress of the Confederation decided that the United States would start using the new Constitution on March 4, 1789. Before that day, Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution. However, when the first United States Congress gathered on March 4 to form the new government, North Carolina and Rhode Island still had not approved the Constitution. After the new Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, though, North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution."
Order of approval.
The Constitution was ratified by the states in this order:
Roberto Perfumo
"Roberto Alfredo Perfumo (3 October 1942 – 10 March 2016) was an Argentine footballer and sports commentator. He was nicknamed ""El Mariscal"". He was thought as one of the best Argentine defenders ever. Perfumo played for Racing, River Plate and Brazilian team Cruzeiro. With the national team, he played the 1966 and 1974 World Cups."
Perfumo died at 73 from a skull injury after falling from a stairway in Buenos Aires on 10 March 2016.
Aldo Ferrer
"Aldo Ferrer (April 15, 1927 – March 8, 2016) was an Argentine economist and policy maker. Ferrer was one of the leading figures of economic nationalism in Argentina. He served as Minister of Economy from 1970 through 1971. He later served as an ambassador to France from Argentine. He served as ambassador from 2011 through 2013. He was born in Buenos Aires."
"Ferrer died in Buenos Aires on March 8, 2016. He was aged 88."
Article Six of the United States Constitution
"Article Six of the United States Constitution says that the Constitution, and any laws or treaties the United States might make, will be the most important laws in the United States. It also says that the United States will pay debts from before the Constitution was written. Finally, it says that members of the United States government have to swear that they will obey the Constitution. However, they will never have to swear that they follow a certain religion."
Debts.
"Before the United States Constitution was written, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. The Articles made the states into a Confederation."
"The first part of Article Six says that the United States will still honor and pay all of its debts from before the Constitution was written. The Article says that ""these debts are as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as [they were] under the Confederation [governed by the Articles of Confederation]."""
Supremacy.
"The second clause of Article Six is often called the ""Supremacy Clause."" It says that these things are the ""supreme"" laws in the United States the most powerful and most important laws in the country:"
Because these laws are supreme:
"For example, part of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights gives people the right to freedom of religion. Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land:"
Later in history.
A few Supreme Court decisions helped make the Supremacy Clause clearer.
"The first important case was ""Marbury v. Madison"" (1803). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that it had the power to review state courts' decisions, if those decisions seemed like they did not follow the supreme law. This power is called judicial review."
"In ""Martin v. Hunter's Lessee"" (1816), the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was more powerful than the state Supreme Courts. In the case, the Virginia Supreme Court said that a United States Supreme Court decision was unconstitutional, and told all of the Virginia state courts not to obey it. The United States Supreme Court ruled that it had the final say in legal issues that had to do with federal laws not the state courts. If a state court and the United States Supreme Court disagree, the Supreme Court is the supreme law of the land."
"Three years later, in ""McCulloch v. Maryland"" (1819), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot control federal institutions. The state of Maryland had tried to tax a federal bank. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot tax government property. This was another example of a case where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the ""supreme laws of the land"" were more powerful than state laws or court decisions."
"In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled on ""Gibbons v. Ogden"" (1824). The state of New York had given Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. However, Thomas Gibbons got the same power from a federal government permit. The Supreme Court decided that the federal permit was more powerful than the state monopoly. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote:"
"Finally, in ""Reid v. Covert"" (1957), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no branch of the United States government can be given extra powers by a treaty, if those powers were not given to it by the Constitution. This case showed that the Constitution could even limit the power of treaties, and was truly the supreme law of the land."
Pertussis
"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a disease that affects about 300,000 people in the US every year, out of 30–50 million cases per year. There is a vaccine that can prevent it, so most cases of it are in places where people cannot afford, cannot get, or refuse to get the vaccine. However, this vaccine does not work forever. The disease lasts about 6 weeks, and symptoms include vomiting, violent coughing, and other flu-like symptoms. It is called whooping cough for the sound an infected person makes when they cough."
"The disease usually infects younger people, as they are more prone to diseases."
Deity
"A deity is thought to be a powerful spirit that controls events and the nature of things. Deities are also called gods. A female god is often called a goddess. The adjective of deity is ‘divine’. This word comes from the Latin ""deus"" (female: ""dea"")."
"Different religions believe in different deities. Since there are many religions in the world there are many different ideas about how many deities there are, what they are, and what they can do. Followers of many ancient religions and some modern religions believe in many deities, which is called polytheism."
"The two largest religions on earth, Christianity and Islam, believe in only one God, which is called monotheism. Deism is the belief that a deity exists, but that the deity does not very often change or never changes things in the universe. Pantheism is the belief that the universe is the deity, while atheism is the belief that there are no deities."
"In most religions, believers think deities are immortal (cannot die), and have powers far beyond human powers."
Examples.
Some of the deities of different religions are:
Odin
"Odin (Old Norse: ""Óðinn"") is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology. Son of Borr and the giantess (jötunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the Æsir and king of Asgard. He is married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, Höðr, Víðarr, and Váli."
"Known as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target."
"A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the Well of Urðr, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being Mímir, which recites secret knowledge to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wōtan, all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *""wōđanaz""."
"The modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god’s name. (from Old English ""Wōdnesdæg"", “Wōden’s day”)."
Family.
"Odin is the son of Borr and the jötunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and Höðr. With the giantesses Gríðr and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named Víðarr and Váli. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by Jörð, the personification of the Earth."
Qazi Muhammad
"Qazi Muhammad (1893-1947) was the Nationalist and Religious Kurdish leader and the Head of Republic of Mahabad (Republic of Kurdistan), the second modern Kurdish state in the Middle East (after Republic of Ararat). He acted as the president of the Russian backed Republic of Mahabad, in Kurdistan of Iran (Eastern Kurdistan) in 1946. He was also the founder of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. A year later, the Kurdish national movement (Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd) that he helped organize was crushed by Iran's central government. The Iranian military court sentenced him to death, and he was hanged in Chuwarchira Square in the center of city of Mahabad at March 30 1947. Mustafa Barzani, the father of nationalist Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan (Southern Kurdistan), was the defence minister in his cabinet. One of his sons Ali Qazi is today an active member in the Kurdish movement."
Brine
"Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food. For this it is much like vinegar or sugar. Brine is also used to transport heat. Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5°C, a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°C, it can hold 23.3% salt."
"Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin, allergies and common colds."
Aladdin
"Aladdin is a fictional person from the story ""Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp"", which is part of the ""Book of One Thousand and One Nights""."
Story.
"The young man Aladdin is told by a sorcerer (magician), who is pretending to be his uncle, to get him an oil lamp from a cave. Aladdin gets the lamp, but the sorcerer tries to trick him. So, Aladdin keeps the lamp for himself. Aladdin learns that inside the lamp there is a djinn. The djinn can fulfill every wish of the lamp's owner. With the djinn's help, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries a princess."
1960 Winter Olympics
"The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VIII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States (in the Lake Tahoe basin). Squaw Valley won the bid in 1955."
"Alexander Cushing, the creator of the resort, campaigned vigorously to win the Games. After being awarded the Games, there was a rush to construct roads, hotels, restaurants, and bridges, as well as the ice arena, the speed skating track, ski lifts, and the ski jumping hill."
1984 Winter Olympics
"The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. (Sarajevo is now in Bosnia and Herzegovina.) Other candidate cities were Sapporo, Japan and Falun, Sweden. It was the first Winter Games and the second Olympics held in Eastern Europe (the first was the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow)."
1988 Winter Olympics
"The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and opened by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé. The Olympics were highly successful financially as they brought in million-dollar profits. The games left a lasting impression on the host city and gave it a new identity from a cowtown to a large commercial sector of the country."
1988 was also the last year that the Paralympic Games and the Winter Olympics were held in separate cities. All Games after the 1988 Winter Olympics have been hosted by the same city or a city nearby.
"The Canadian team did not win a gold medal during the 1988 Winter Olympics, similar to how the Canadian team did not win one during the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. At the time, Canada and Yugoslavia were the only countries that had not won a gold medal when their country hosted the Olympics. (However, Canada would later win a gold medal when the 2010 Winter Olympics were hosted in Vancouver.)"
History.
Background.
"Calgary first tried for the Olympics in 1964, and again in 1968."
Records of the Grand Historian
"The Records of the Grand Historian () was written by Sima Qian, the historian of the Han Dynasty. It is a book recording Chinese history from the time of 3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors until the reign of Emperor Wu of Han."
Football at the Summer Olympics
Football (soccer) has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932 as a men's competition sport. Women's football was added to the official program at the 1996 Atlanta edition.
History.
"Football was not in the original modern Olympic Games program as international football was not that popular in 1896. However an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition. Complete records have been lost and may not even be true but it seems that only two games may have been played. An Athens XI lost to a team representing Smyrna (Izmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. Smyrna went on to be beaten 15-0 by a team from Denmark. Demonstration tournaments were played at the 1900 and 1904 games and the ""Intercalated Games"" of 1906, but these were contested by various clubs and scratch teams, and are not considered to be official Olympic events. Neither FIFA nor the IOC recognize the Intercalated Games. The first proper tournament is said to be in the 1908 Olympics, organized by the Football Association. It had 6 teams. The next tournament was organized by the Swedish Football Association in 1912. However, the tournament was very unbalanced, with some high scoring games such as 10-0 and 12-0, and all of the players were amateurs. The tournaments of 1924 and 1928 are the two only editions officially recognised by FIFA as championships of the world."
"For the 1984 Olympics, the IOC admitted professional players."
"Since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, all teams have to be under-23 years old. Since 1996, three over 23 players are allowed."
"A women's edition was added in 1996. The women's tournament has no age restrictions, unlike the men's tournament."
1976 Winter Olympics
"The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria. The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado, United States in May 1970, but a 300 percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to voters' rejection of a $5 million bond issue to finance the games in 1972. As a result, the IOC offered the games to Whistler, British Columbia (Canada), who had bid on the games, but they also declined due to a change of government there. (Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.) The IOC finally called on Innsbruck, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Games just twelve years earlier, to also host the 1976 games. Salt Lake City, Utah, which would eventually host in 2002, offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC declined."
Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics
"Gymnastics has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. For thirty years, only men were allowed to compete. Women's events were introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The competition was held in artistic gymnastics discipline until 1984, when rhythmic gymnastics discipline was added to the program of the Olympics. Since 2000, trampolining discipline has also been competed."
Political parties.
"Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism."
"The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last ""status voting"" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades."
Demographics.
"Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world."
The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is:
Culture.
Literature.
"Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are René Marqués (author of ""The Oxcart"") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton""). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (""Yo fui mi ruta"") and Giannina Braschi (author the poetry epic ""Empire of Dreams""). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican). Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets."
Art.
"José Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter. He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rodón who paints portraits of celebrities. In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico."
Music.
"Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and R""eggaeton"". One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13. World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for ""Best Latin Pop Performance"" for Living La Vida Loca."
Philosophy.
"Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio María de Hostos. He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco José Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism. Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice. Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz. Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers."
Jonathan Ke Quan
"Jonathan Ke Quan (born August 20, 1971 as Ke Huy Quan) is a Vietnamese-American former child actor."
"In the 1980s, he appeared in several movies. His best known roles were as Short Round in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984) and Data in ""The Goonies"" (1985). He now works as a stunt coordinator on many movies, for example ""X-Men""."
"In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, he was an orphan in the streets of Shanghai when he becomes Indy's(Harrison Ford) friend. They end up in India where Indy, Short Round and night club singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) fight Indians, save children, and participate in a mine car chase."
"After their adventures in India, Short Round disappeared temporarily. He later grew up to become an archeologist. He went on an adventure in search of the Peacock Stone, the same diamond lost at the beginning of ""Temple of Doom""."
Pilgrimage
A pilgrimage is when people travel to a place of worship that is usually far away. They may have to go to a different city or country. Usually a pilgrimage is done for spiritual or religious reasons. The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by Pope Benedict XVI this way:
There are also non-religious pilgrimages; they include for example:
1703
"The year 1703 (MDCCIII) started on a Monday, (or a Thursday by the 11-day slower Julian calendar)."
Watermelon
"A watermelon (""Citrullus lanatus"") is a plant which was first domesticated in Africa. It is a cultivated edible fruit. It is grown worldwide, there are more than 1000 varieties."
"About 6% of a watermelon is sugar, which makes it very sweet. There are many different types of watermelon. Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical. In Japan, watermelons are grown in different shapes, such as hearts and squares."
"On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are ""GO"", ""Free Parking"", ""JAIL"", and ""Go to Jail"". Along the sides of the board are properties (streets and businesses) for sale. The properties are: 22 ""streets"" (each marked with one of eight colors), 4 ""railroad stations"", the ""Electric Company"" and the ""Water Works"". There are also spaces called ""Income Tax"", ""Luxury Tax"", ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance""."
"In the original version, the properties and railroad stations were named after the streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London."
Setting up the Game.
"To prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are shuffled and placed face down on the board. Each player chooses a token (a playing piece), such as a thimble, a rocking horse, a boot, a dog, etc. (the tokens vary depending on the edition), and places it on ""GO"". One player is chosen to be the banker - this player is trusted with handing out money from the bank and collecting players' spent money during the game."
"The banker gives each player $1500 to start with. Each player rolls the dice, and the player who rolled the highest total takes the first turn."
Rules.
The object of the game is to own as much land (property) and to be the richest player.
"The rules can be found in every ""Monopoly"" box, but a summary is listed here."
Moving Around The Board.
"On your turn, you roll the dice and move your token forward (clockwise around the edge of the board) the same number of spaces as the sum of the dice you rolled. You must then follow the instructions of whatever space your token lands on."
"If you roll doubles (the same number on both dice), you get to take another turn after this one is over. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you don't get your third turn but you must go directly to Jail (see below)."
Jail.
"The Jail space has two sections, labeled IN JAIL and JUST VISITING. If you land on Jail by your normal roll of the dice, place your token on JUST VISITING and nothing bad (or good) happens to you. But there are three ways to be placed IN JAIL:"
"If you are put into Jail, take your token from wherever it is and place it directly on IN JAIL. This does not count as a move, so if this causes you to go past GO, you don't collect $200 from the Bank. If you are put in Jail, your turn ends immediately, even if you rolled doubles and would get to take another turn."
"While you are in Jail, you still roll the dice on your turn but you don't get to move your token. There are three ways to get out of Jail:"
Note that being in Jail doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game - it just stops your token from moving around the board.
Different editions.
"There are many editions of Monopoly. Officially-licensed editions are produced by Hasbro itself or by USAopoly, and unofficial editions are published by Toy Vault. Official versions are named ""____ Monopoly"" (such as ""Star Wars Monopoly"") and feature the Monopoly logo, and unofficial versions are named ""____-Opoly"" (such as ""Python-Opoly"") and do not feature the Monopoly logo."
"Milton Bradley has produced editions to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970s Monopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street properties."
"A number of video game adaptations have been made. In addition, many electronic editions exist that use credit cards instead of paper money."
"In India, a similar game is called Business."
"In Egypt, a similar game is called بنك الحظ (The Bank of Luck)."
"Acquire is another game with rules for more advanced business practices with stocks, but has similar basic concepts of Monopoly (owning properties of the same color, buying land and building on it, making the most money, etc.)."
Uses for Monopoly.
"People play Monopoly for different reasons. Some may play for family game night, others use it as a learning tool at school, and others play it just to have fun."
"Monopoly may be used as a teaching tool to teach children a variety of lessons while having fun. It teaches how to make deals when trading, playing fair (because cheaters never win), knowing the value of money, addition and subtraction, good sportsmanship, the thrill of competition, strategies and organization. At an elementary level, “it offers a marvelous vehicle for teaching mathematics”. Through the game, children explore different areas of mathematics: not only adding and subtracting but also probability, percentages, and patterns. At a higher level, teachers can use Monopoly to teach microeconomics principles."

Area code 312
"Area code 312 is an area code that is part of Illinois. It was one of the first area codes created in 1947. It initially covered the entire northeastern portion of Illinois, but after it was split by 708 in 1989, 630, 847, and 773, all in 1996, it now covers only downtown Chicago, with 708 and 773 covering the rest of Chicago. It was overlaid by 872 in 2009."
Civil government in Portugal
"In Portugal, the civil governments (Portuguese: ""Governos Civis"", singular ""Governo Civil"") are the groups of public administration that represent the government at the district level. Each civil government is led by an administrative magistrate ""and"" the civil governor (""Governador Civil""). The administrative magistrate is a delegate of the central government. The civil governor is chosen by the Council of Ministers. The civil government operated under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Administration."
"The role of Civil Governments has become smaller since their creation in 1835. At first, they had many powers as representatives of the central government . They also made certiain that all State services within the district worked together. They now serve as a local delegations of the Ministry of Internal Administration. Their responsibilties inclue issuing passports, public safety, and elections."
"In 2011, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho ended all Civil Governments with Decree-Law No. 114/2011 of 30 November. That law gave all of the powers of the civil governments to other groups. These include the Municipal Chambers, the police, the National Republican Guard and the National Authority for Civil Protection). No civil governors have been appointed since this time but the post was created by the Constitution and still exists"

Minecraft PE
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is a mobile version of Minecraft for phones and tablets. In 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Android market as an early version. It was then released for other devices in October 2011. An iOS version was released on November 2011, and a port was made for Windows Phones after Microsoft bought Mojang. The port focuses on the basic building and the survival parts of the game, and does not have all the features of the PC version. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is in C++ and not Java code, because of iOS not being able to support Java code. However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices."
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on December 19, 2016."
List of Secretaries of State of the United States
This is a list of secretaries of state of the United States.
Secretaries of foreign affairs (1781–1789).
"On January 10, 1780, the Confederation Congress created the Department of Foreign Affairs."
"On August 10, 1781, Congress put Robert R. Livingston as the first Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Livingston was not able able to go into office until October 20, 1781. He was the Secretary of Foreign Affairs until June 4, 1783. He was succeeded by John Jay on December 21, 1784. He served who served until March 4, 1789. Jay stopped being the Secretary of foreign affairs, when the government went from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution."
John Jay was the Secretary of State until Thomas Jefferson came back from France.
Secretaries of state.
"On September 15, 1789, Washington made a law that changed the name of the office from Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Secretary of State and he changed the name of the department to the Department of State. He also added many powers and responsibilities to the secretary and the department. Thomas Jefferson was the first Secretary of State on March 22, 1790."
List of secretaries of state by time in office.
This is a list of United States secretaries of state by time in office. This is based on the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater. Cordell Hull is the only person to have served as Secretary of State for more than eight years. Daniel Webster and James G. Blaine are the only secretaries of state to have ever served non-consecutive terms. Warren Christopher served very briefly as Acting Secretary of State non-consecutively with his later tenure as full-fledged Secretary of State. Elihu B. Washburne served as Secretary of State for less than two weeks before becoming Ambassador to France.
"They hunt whales for their oil, made from their fat, called ""blubber"", and the meat. Today, there is a treaty which bans the hunt of some whale species. Most countries signed the treaty. A few countries still hunt whales for research purposes. Among those countries are Norway, Iceland and Japan."
Crayon
"Crayons are writing tools made with colored wax, water, and citric acid or chalk. Young children often use them to draw. Some adult artists use them too. They melt at a low temperature so they can be used in crayon-drip art. One very well-known brand of crayons is Crayola, a company by Binney and Smith."
Self-defence
"Self-defence means fighting off something or another person to protect yourself and maybe others. Ways of self-defence include martial arts or using a weapon. Sometimes, self-defense can cause serious harm to the other person. In most nations, you cannot be prosecuted for this harm. In the United States, an act of self-defence can only count as self-defence if the victim is in a situation that can cause them serious injury or death. In international law all persons have the right to self-defence."
Defence of others.
"The law of self-defence is the same when you protect others. Generally, you must have a good reason or belief that you needed to defend yourself in self-defence. However, in many places, if the court decides that the defence may have been too extreme, the person may face criminal and civil charges."
1913
"1913 (MCMXIII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar, and a common year starting on a Tuesday in the 13-day slower Julian calendar. It was the 913th year of the 2nd Millennium, 13th year of the 20th Century and the 4th year of the 1910s decade."
1469
1469 was a common year.
Dodgeball
"Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls, or hard rubber balls, at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball,he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside."
"Dodgeball is often played in elementary schools in physical education classes. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because players can get hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools."
"Dodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film """" (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, ""Extreme Dodgeball""."
Local area network
"A local area network (LAN) is a computer network in a small area like a home, office, or school. Many computers can be connected to share information and Internet connections. Most LANs use Ethernet to connect together."
Topology.
"LAN topologies tell you how ROM devices are organised. Five common LAN topologies exist: bus, ring, star, tree, and mesh. These topologies are logical architectures. This means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices, but that the actual cables that connect the devices might not be connected the same way. For example, logical bus and ring topologies are commonly organized physically as a star."
Pharaoh
"Pharaohs were kings of ancient Egypt. The word comes from the Coptic language word ""Per-aa"", which means ""Great House"". Pharaohs were believed to be descended from the gods."
"The Valley of the Nile had been lived in by early humans for at least 700,000 years. The area has a long history of human civilization, but Egypt as a state begins in about 5660 BC. At this time, the separate kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united."
"People studying Egyptian history have divided the pharaohs into 31 groupings, called dynasties. These dynasties were usually, but not always, based on a related family group. During the long period of the pharaoh's rule over Egypt, there were times when they did not control the whole country. This means that some dynasties only controlled part of the country, and another dynasty ruled another part at the same time. Also there are not complete records, so there are gaps in the lists of pharaohs, and it can be very difficult to list the rulers in chronological order. The origins of the first pharaohs survive only as legends."
"Before the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, kings wore crowns of different design, to show which part of Egypt they ruled. The red crown was worn in Lower Egypt. The white crown was worn in Upper Egypt. Later, kings of the whole of ancient Egypt wore a combination of the two crowns, called a Pschent."
"When a pharaoh died, their personal treasure was buried with them; not the treasure of the entire kingdom. The pharaohs were buried in large tombs, the largest and most famous were the Pyramids. Many later pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. Paintings and writings discovered in these tombs have provided much of our knowledge of the pharaohs. New discoveries, such as that in 2014 of a new dynasty ruled by a previously unknown pharaoh, Senebkay, are changing what we know about ancient Egypt. They were mostly men, but there were women such as Cleopatra and Nefertiti. Pharaohs were considered to be half-man and half-god."
"In South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice)."
"In Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as 柚子茶 (Youzi cha)."
[Note: The Korean Yuja is the same as the Japanese Yuzu 柚子 and must be different from the citron being described in this article. The Japanese Yuzu = Citrus junos.]
Citric acid
"Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits ( like oranges). It is used by organisms for Krebs cycle. It acts like a preservative when added to food. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks. In the European Union it is known as E 330, as a food additive."
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is C6H8O7."
Geber
"Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (; ; died between 806 and 816), is the name for the writer of a great number of writings in Arabic. The writings together have the name Jabirian corpus. The most important subjects of these writings are: alchemy, cosmology, numerology, astrology, medicine, magic, mysticism, and philosophy."
"Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of chemical substances. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance (ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair)."
"Modern scholars doubt the historical existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a pseudonym that a group of writers used."
"Translations into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the ""Book of Mercy"", and the ""Book of Seventy"") came into existence in the Middle Ages. In Latin, Jabir had the name ""Geber"", a transliteration of ""Jabir""."
"In 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, called pseudo-Geber, started to produce new writings about alchemy under the name Geber. People still read the in the 17th century. The """" was one of the writings that pseudo-Geber produced in the 13th century. It was an influence on early modern chemists like Robert Boyle (1627–1691)."
Carl Wilhelm Scheele
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele (December 9, 1742 - May 21, 1786) a German-Swedish pharmaceutical chemist, born in Stralsund, Western Pomerania, Germany (at the time under Swedish rule), was the discoverer of many chemical substances, most notably discovering oxygen before Joseph Priestley and chlorine before Humphry Davy."
Micheline Calmy-Rey
Micheline Calmy-Rey (born 8 July 1945) is a Swiss politician. She was Switzerland's foreign minister as head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. She was also a member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2003. She was President of the Confederation in 2007 and again in 2011. She resigned her office as member of the Federal Council on 31 December 2011.

Angel performs many different types of stunts and illusions on the program such as street magic, levitation, and setting himself on fire. The program was first shown on July 20, 2005. It is shown and distributed by the A&amp;E network."
Piano trio
"A piano trio is a group of three instruments including a piano. Usually it is a piano, a violin and a cello. This combination of instruments has been a very popular form of chamber music from the Classical music period onwards. A piano trio can also mean a piece of music written for a piano trio to play."
"Other combinations of piano with two instruments are often called by the featuring wind instrument. For example: Mozart wrote a trio for piano, clarinet and viola which is usually called a “clarinet trio”. Brahms wrote a trio for piano, violin and French horn which is usually called a “horn trio”."
Music for three people to play at one piano is called music for piano six hands.
Famous music for piano trio.
"Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote several piano trios for the traditional combination of piano, violin and cello. Beethoven’s last piano trio has the nickname ""Archduke"" because it was written for the Archduke Rudolph. Franz Schubert wrote two beautiful piano trios."
"In the Romantic period some of the best piano trios were written by Felix Mendelssohn, Antonín Dvořák, César Franck and Pyotr Tchaikovsky."
In the 20th century Maurice Ravel and Dmitri Shostakovich each wrote a famous piano trio.
Dierks Bentley
"Frederick Dierks Bentley (born November 20, 1975) is an American country music singer and songwriter."
Bihu
"Bihu is the most prominent festival celebrated by the people of Assam. It is a set of three celebrations performed throughout the year. The three Bihus are celebrated at different times of year, in the months of Bohaag (Baisakhi), Kaati (Kartik) and Maagh, according to Hindu calendar. As per modern calendar these days fall in the month of mid April, October/ November and early January."
"Assam is a small state in the north-eastern part of the country. Its economy is mainly based on agriculture. The inhabitants of Assam are known agrarians from ages. Hence all their daily activities and celebrations are agriculture oriented only. Bihu is also one of such festivals. It is very much evident from the months of celebration of this festival that these months are actually significant in relation with farming of native crop of Assam, the paddy. Bohaag bihu is celebrated at the seeding time of paddy. Kaati bihu is celebrated when the sowing of paddy is complete and the transformation of the saplings is done. Maagh bihu represents the culmination of the harvesting period of the crop."
"The word bihu is derived from the language of ‘dimasa kacharis’, which is the agricultural community of Assam, since ages. The word was originally ‘Bishu’, which meant ‘to ask for prosperity’ from the tribal god. Bihu is the distorted version of Bishu."
"Bohaag bihu is also known as Rongali bihu and celebrated with the highest joy and mirth among all the three bihus. As stated it is the commencement time of the new season of farming. But along with, Bohaag is the first month according to Assamese calendar. Hence it is also celebrated as the New Year festival. This period also marks the transition in the seasonal cycle and people greet the coming season of spring with enthusiasm. Rongali bihu is celebrated over a period of 7 days. There are various phases and significance of the respective 7 days of the bihu. The first day is known as goru bihu (cows are washed and worshipped). This is followed by manuha bihu (human beings take early day bath and wear new attire). Then on third day deities are worshipped and washed. Hence the festival stretches over a span of time and the celebrations culminate by bidding adieu to bihu on the last day of festival."
"Kati bihu is also known as kongali bihu. It is celebrated with solidarity. However, the celebrations are quietest of all the three bihus. The farmers are busy in their paddy fields and earthen lamps are lit to mark the celebrations. Farmers pray for a better crop during this time of the farming cycle."
"Maagh bihu is also known as Bhogaali bihu. Bhogalli means eating and enjoyment. Hence the name itself implies the mood of the festival. Men folk prepare cottages in the barren fields after harvesting of the crops and spend whole night while singing and dancing in communion. Delicious food and sweets are exchanged among the people. In the very next morning, the cottage is lit up in fire and this brings an end to yearly festival of bihu."
"It is quite evident that bihu is a festival of farming community whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon the agriculture. The festival of bihu is celebrated by one and all in Assam. The boundaries of rich or poor, cast creed etc are diminished in the dazzling light of joy and merriment."
Stefan Nutz
Stefan Nutz (born 15 February 1992) is an Austrian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Austrian Bundesliga club SV Ried.
Career.
"In ""Liber Pontificalis"", it says that they ascribe a decree to Pope Eleutherius that no kind of food should be despised by Christians(Et hoc iterum firmavit ut nulla esca a Christianis repudiaretur, maxime fidelibus, quod Deus creavit, quæ tamen rationalis et humana est)."
Underground cable
"An underground cable is a cable that is buried below the ground. They distribute electrical power or telecommunications. Such cables are an alternative to overhead cables, which are several meters above the ground. Overhead cables are often replaced with underground cables. Downtown areas with many tall buildings usually have few or no cables above ground, This is mainly for aesthetic purposes because underground cables can not be seen. They are also less dangerous to people because they are out of the way. They cost more to install, but last longer."
Pope Gelasius II
Pope Gelasius II (??? − 29 January 1119) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 24 January 1118 to his death in 29 January 1119.
"He was born in Gaeta, Principality of Capua and died in Cluny, Duchy of Burgundy, Kingdom of France. He was ordained a priest on 9 March 1118 after he fled to Gaeta. He returned to Rome in July under Norman protection after he excommunicated Henry V and the antipope."
Hualien County
Hualien County () is a county in Taiwan. It is the largest county in Taiwan in terms of area. It is located on the mountainous eastern coast.
It contains the Port of Hualien. It is famous for tourism.
Kinmen
"Kinmen (or Quemoy) is a small group of islands close to the coast of China. It is governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan). It forms a county, Kinmen County (), of Fujian Province. The capital is Jincheng Township."
"The county is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as part of its own Fujian Province. It is very close to Xiamen, no more than 2 kilometres."
"Unlike the early sauropsids, ""Hylonomus"" and its kin, ""Archaeothyris"" was relatively large, measuring head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~reptiles), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged canines, suggesting that it was a carnivore."
"""Archaeothyris"" lived in what is now Nova Scotia, about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period (Pennsylvanian). Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp, similar to today's Everglades in Florida. The 'trees' (actually giant clubmosses) were very tall. Some, such as ""Lepidodendron"", were up to tall. ""Archaeothyris"" and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor."
Ray Milland
Ray Milland (3 January 1907 – 10 March 1986) was a Welsh actor and director.

"He was a special guest star in ""General Electric Theater"", ""Night Gallery"", ""Columbo"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Fantasy Island"", ""The Love Boat"", ""Hart to Hart"", and many more."
Canine tooth
"Canine teeth are found in mammals. They are the eye teeth, fangs or dogteeth. They are on either side of the incisors. Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart, and also attack and defence."
"In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth."
Premolar
The premolar teeth of mammals are the teeth between the canines and the molars. There are at most a total of eight of them. The number is reduced in the dental formula of many species.
"As the name suggests, they are like smaller molars, and their function is to crush and grind food."
Water park
"A water park (occasionally written as ""waterpark"") is an theme park that features water play areas, such as water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider."
Evolution of water parks.
"Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association)."
"Water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort, a member of the World Water Park Association, is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the communities' destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides. A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented; e.g. Schwaben Quellen, a member of European Waterparks Association (EWA) has no water slides, but instead has many saunas, steam rooms, ""adventure showers"", and relaxation-oriented water play areas."
"From 2000's, popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions. To solve this problem, some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets."
A unique feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion.
Indoor water parks.
"The first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the $1.2 billion dollar Phase III expansion. Called World Waterpark, it is over in size. It also includes one of the world's largest indoor wave pool, waterslides of varying degrees, tube rides, bungee jumping, and hot tubs."
"They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top. They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or ""advocaat"" filling, or with no filling at all. The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried."
Naming.
"The name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany. Most areas in German speaking regions call it a ""Berliner"". Residents of Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony often know them as ""Pfannkuchen"", which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes - pancakes are known there as ""Eierkuchen"" (lit. egg cakes). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of ""Krapfen""; in Hessen they are referred to as ""Kräppel"" or ""Kreppel"", or, in Palatinate, ""Fastnachtsküchelchen"" (literally: ""little carnival cakes"")."
"In South Tirol, part of northern Italy, the food is called ""krafen"" or ""krapfen"". In Slovenia, it is ""krof""; in Croatia ""krafne""; in Bosnia, and Serbia ""krofne"". In Poland they are known as ""pączki"", in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called ""fánk"". All of these are essentially identical preparations. In Spain it is called ""Berlinesa"". In the Netherlands it is called ""Berlinerbol"". IN France it is called ""Boule de Berlin""."
"In English-speaking countries, Berliners are often called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream. However, in South Australia, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglophone North America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is ""jelly doughnut"". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not ""set"" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream."
The cream or custard-filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.
"In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest in the U.S., such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a ""Bismarck,"" while a filled bar doughnut is called a ""Long John"", and usually contains pastry creme, custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include ""jambuster"" in Manitoba, and ""Burlington bun"" in Nova Scotia."
New Year's Eve.
"Berliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (""Silvester"") as well as the carnival holidays (Mardi Gras). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone."
Variations.
"In Portugal, berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as ""bolas de Berlim"" (Berlin ball) and the filling is always an egg-yolk- based yellow cream called ""creme pasteleiro"" (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half- length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle on it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country."
"Such versions are also found in Latin America, in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, where it's not only filled with custard (called ""Crema pastelera""), but with jam (especially red ones) or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called ""sonhos"" (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow cream (called simply ""creme""). Some modern variants filled with ""doce de leite"" (a type of milk jam), or a mix of chocolate and ""doce de leite"", can be found in Rio de Janeiro's bakeries."
"In Israel, a version of the pastry called ""sufganiyah"" is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah. While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam, many modern variants exist."
Campbell University
"Campbell University is a private, coeducational baptist university in Buies Creek, North Carolina. The university has about 10,471 students. It was founded in 1887. The current president of the university is Jerry M. Wallace."
Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university are called the Fighting Camels. They have 18 varsity teams which mostly compete in the Big South Conference. Despite the Big South sponsoring football, the Campbell football team plays in the Pioneer Football League (PFL). That league is made up of schools that choose not to offer scholarships for football, despite offering them in other sports."
Belmont University
"Belmont University is a private, coeducational university in Nashville, Tennessee. The university has about 5,936 students. It was founded in 1890. The current president of the university is Robert Fisher."
Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university, called the Bruins, mostly play in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The men's tennis team plays in the Horizon League because the MVC sponsors tennis only for women."
Florida Gulf Coast University
"Florida Gulf Coast University is a public, coeducational university in Fort Myers, Florida. The university has about 12,024 students. It was founded in 1991. The current president of the university is Wilson G. Bradshaw."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Eagles and they have 15 varsity teams. They compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Jacksonville University
"Jacksonville University is a private university in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. The university has about 3,600 students. It was founded in 1934. The current president of the university is Kerry D. Romesburg."
Sports.
"The holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound. Whisper keys were also invented to prevent overblowing. The bassoon is known for its reedy sound. Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary. Middle register could be used for lullabies because of its majestic and soothing tone. Its lower register is deep, dark, and could be used for scary movies and such."
History and repertoire.
"The bassoon developed from a renaissance instrument called the ""curtal"" or ""dulcian"". These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms. In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line, perhaps playing the same as the cello. A man named Hotteterre made many parts of the modern bassoon. In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra. Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart, and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies. The bassoon was a very important instrument in the orchestra. Mozart and Beethoven gave the bassoon important parts in the music."
Contrabassoon.
"In some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used. This plays an octave lower than a bassoon, taking it right down to bottom B flat or C on the piano. Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower, i.e. the very lowest note of the piano (A). One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra, but in fact the tube keeps doing U-turns, making four parallel rows of tubing. They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards. The weight is supported by a peg to the floor. The contrabassoon used to be shaped like a bassoon."
"The contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra. Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn-like introduction to the last movement of ""Symphony no 1"" by Brahms. It can be clearly heard, growling away, in the opening of the ""Piano Concerto for the Left Hand"" by Ravel."
Octave
An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.
If a musician sings or plays a scale (‘do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do’) the first and last ‘do’ are an octave apart. It is called an ‘octave’ because there are eight notes in a scale (‘octo’ is Latin for ‘eight’).
If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “Somewhere over the rainbow” (i.e. the word ‘Somewhere’) these two notes are an octave apart.
"Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar, almost like the same note. The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast. For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second. The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second."
"Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger)."
Tinder
Tinder is a material that is used to start fires easily when lit with a match.
Some materials commonly used as tinder are:
Stephen Harper
"Stephen Joseph Harper (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian economist, entrepreneur, and retired politician. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015. He is a member and the former leader of the Conservative Party, after being elected in 2004. He was elected in February 2006 and replaced Paul Martin as Prime Minister."
"Harper was born in 1959 in Toronto, Ontario and lives in Calgary, Alberta. He is married to Laureen Teskey and has two children. He is the third Prime Minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, to send their children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. Stephen Harper was Prime Minister for nine years, during which Canada hosted both the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games. Harper also hosted the G8 and G20 meetings."
"Harper is a conservative and supports cutting government spending and taxes. As Prime Minister, he has cut the goods and services tax and approved a budget that would cut funding to several government programs. He has also shown support for the military and a bigger Canadian military presence in the northern part of Canada."
"Even though Harper did win the seat in the riding of Calgary Heritage during the October 19, 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party was defeated by the Liberal Party of Canada, which was led by Justin Trudeau and who succeeded Harper as Prime Minister. It was thereafter announced Harper would resign as party leader and had requested an interim leader be chosen to serve until a leadership election can be held."
Tadpole
A tadpole or polliwog is the larva of a frog. It breathes water and lives in the water. Tadpoles hatch from small eggs.
"Frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. Like bird eggs, they have nutrients (food) inside them for the young animal to grow before it hatches."
Movement.
"Tadpoles swim by lateral undulation: their tails move side to side, not up and down."
Food.
"Most types of tadpole eat only plants, for example algae on rocks. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles."
Metamorphosis.
"In Russia, which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, composers were not allowed to be experimental. It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect “Socialist realism” (meaning the workers’ struggle against capitalism). The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev (who spent some time in exile) and Shostakovich (who remained in the Soviet Union)."
"The Hungarian composer Béla Bartók developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries. His music is often quite neoclassical, for example the famous ""Concerto for Orchestra""."
Avant garde experiments.
"In the mid-20th century a group of composers known as the “Darmstadt School” (because they often met in Darmstadt) continued to write music which was based on serialism. This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of them, including both Boulez and Stockhausen, also experimented with electronic music. The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music. It means that it expands the limits, or pushes ahead into new ground (literally the “front guard”, a military analogy). Other American composers were experimental, e.g. Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a “prepared piano” (a piano which makes strange sounds because strange objects are put inside it)."
Jazz influence.
"In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers. George Gershwin’s music is halfway between jazz and classical. Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music. In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz, e.g. Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill."
Minimalism.
"Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated. Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varèse, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand. People found it too mathematical and intellectual. They wanted music with feeling and emotion. A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques. It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated."
Other paths based on tradition.
"While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music. The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer (i.e. he took ideas from many different people). Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton, who each developed their own style. In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber, Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness. In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers. Like Kurt Weill, he often wrote music which had a political purpose, but Weill's music is more jazz-inspired."
"Some contemporary composers (alive today) write music which is deeply religious. These include John Tavener and Arvo Pärt. John Rutter and Bob Chilcott, who write music for choirs which sounds fresh and attractive to new audiences. Other composers have found various ways of creating their own style, e.g. the Scottish composers James MacMillan and Judith Weir and the Master of the Queen's Music: Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. In Russia Sofia Gubaidulina and Galina Ustvolskaya are important voices in the search for new music."
Cuxhaven
"Cuxhaven ( , ; ) is an independent town and seat of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is on the shore of the North Sea at the mouth of the Elbe River. Cuxhaven has a footprint of (east–west) by (north–south). Its town quarters Duhnen, Döse and Sahlenburg are popular vacation spots on the North Sea and home to about 52,000 residents."
Geographical and cultural background.
The town is served by Cuxhaven station.
The island of Neuwerk is off the coast from Cuxhaven.
Twin towns – sister cities.
Cuxhaven is twinned with:
Haifa Wehbe
"Haifa Wehbe (, born March 10, 1972) is a female Lebanese singer, actress, model, and jewelry designer who is known in the Arab world. Wehbe was born in a rural town in South Lebanon and currently lives in Beirut. She started her music career with her debut album ""Huwa az-Zaman"" (, ""It is Time"")."
Early life and career.
"Before she became a singer, she was a model. She won title ""Miss South Lebanon"" when she was sixteen. In 1995, she was the runner-up for Miss Lebanon before the public found out she had a daughter named Zeinab."
"Her second 2005 album was ""Baddi 'Ayš"" (, ""I Want to Live""). Her second songs was ""Ana Haifa"" (""I am Haifa"")."
She also appeared in Pepsi ad with French footballer Thierry Henry.
Dynamics (music)
"In music, the dynamics in the piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases."
"In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano”, as a dynamic level, is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”)."
"Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music."
"Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly. Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another."
"Tradition tells that he was a member of the Sanguini family. Before being elected, he was the cardinal-priest of the church of Santa Susanna in Rome."
He died on 15 March 931 in Rome and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Pope Stephen VII.
Korea University Museum
"Korea University Museum is in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It was established in 1934 as the first university museum in Korea. When it was first established there used to be a separate university museum building. But in 2005, Korea University Museum was moved to the Centennial Memorial Samsung Hall which is on the right side of the main gate. The museum is divided into four floors including the basement floor. There are five exhibition halls including Centennial Hall, History Folklore Hall, Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Hall, Donation Hall and Special Exhibition Hall."
Layout.
"On the first floor is the Centennial Hall, which introduces the 100 years of Korea University. This hall is divided into four parts including the history of Korea University, two theme rooms and a theater room which shows the past and history of Korea University."
"History Folklore Hall is on the second floor displaying ceramics, Buddhist art of Korea, calligraphy and paintings. The History Folklore Hall is divided into two rooms: Joseon Dynasty Room and Ancient Art Room. Joseon Dynasty room is divided into five parts displaying cultural relics of Joseon Dynasty: the earth and the sky of Joseon, life of Joseon, patterns of Joseon, social system of Joseon, life of Min Yeong-hwan and Yu Kil-chun. Ancient Art Room displays ceramics, Buddhist art, and traditional paintings of  Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, Goryeo and Joseon."
"The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room, which exhibits the paintings and sculptures of Korea's modern art, is on the third floor. The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room displays the modern art of Korea which shows the influence of Western art techniques. This room presents the transfiguration of Korean traditional paintings."
"Also, the Donation Hall is on the third floor exhibiting the relics which were donated to the university museum."
"The Special Exhibition Hall, which is open occasionally for special displays, is in the basement floor. Special exhibitions are held three to four times every year."
Collection.
"Korea University Museum possesses approximately one hundred thousand relics including three National Treasures, which are Honcheonsigye, Donggwoldo and Buncheong ware. Also, the traditional Korean paintings by Sim Sa-jeong, Jeong Seon and Kim Hong-do and modern arts by Park Su-geun, Whanki Kim and Yi Eungro are in display. The museum displays various relics of all times in fields of history, archaeology, folklore and art, continuously developing a variety of exhibitions and education for public."
"Honcheonsigye, National Treasure of Korea No. 230."
"Honcheonsigye is a celestial globe clock created by Song I-yeong in 1669. The clock has an armillary sphere with a diameter of 40 cm. Unlike Chinese astronomical clock, it could measure the accurate time by observing the whole movement of universe. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon Dynasty. An image of the clock's sphere is shown on the reverse of the 2007 issued 10,000 won banknotes."
"Donggwoldo, National Treasure of Korea No. 249."
"Donggwoldo literally means ""Painting of Eastern Palace."" The painting depicts the Eastern Palaces, Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung in 19th century. ""Donggwol"" is an alternative name of Changdeokgung, which means it is located to the East of the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty,Gyeongbokgung. The palaces in this painting were depicted elaborately in details so its value as the reference of Joseon Dynasty's palace arrangement is great."
"Buncheong ware, National Treasure of Korea No. 177."
"Buncheong ware or  Punch'ong ware, is a type of celadon in grayish blue color. It is a style of Korea's traditional stoneware, which emerged in the middle era of Joseon Dynasty. It started to lose its popularity after 16th century with the appearance of white porcelains. Korea University Museum owns a special Buncheong ware which was a jar to contain the placenta of Royal Family in Joseon Dynasty."
Poitou
Poitou was a province of France of west-central France whose capital city was Poitiers.
"There is a marshland called the Poitevin Mar on the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort."
"Many of the Acadians who settled in what is now Nova Scotia beginning in 1604 and later to New Brunswick, came from the region of Poitou. After the Acadians were deported by the British beginning in 1755, a number of Acadians eventually took refuge in Poitou and in Québec. A large portion of these refugees also migrated to Louisiana in 1785 and following years became known as Cajuns."
Kristubhagavatam
"Kristubhagavatam is a mahakavya (an epic poem) written in Sanskrit. It is based on the life of Jesus Christ. It was written by Mahakavi P. C. Devassia. Devassia was a Sanskrit scholar from Kerala, India."
Pope John VII
Pope John VII (650 – 18 October 707) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1 March 705 until 18 October 707 when he died.
His father was Plato was a curator of the Palatine Hill. This makes him the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official.
"He had bad relations with the Quinisext council of 692 but had good relations with the Lombards, who had ruled much of Italy at the time. Liber Pontificalis criticized Pope John VII for not signing Canons which were really unpopular in Italy at the time."
Cheongsam
"Cheongsam (长衫) is typical, traditional clothing for Chinese women. Also known as Qipao (Ch'ipau)."
"A cheongsam usually has two long slits at either side of the hem for convenient movement and display of the legs. Unlike a short skirt, the slits of cheongsam show a woman's legs when she walks."
"A more formal description is: a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric left-over-right opening (youren) and two side slits."
"The modern Cheongsam was developed in Shanghai in the 1920s. Several alterations have been made to the design. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1940s, as many noble and high-class women wore it. Although the cheongsam is thought to be traditional Chinese clothing, it is modern."
The traditional Qipao evolved from Manchu women's Changpao during the Qing Dynasty.
Kikuyu
Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya. They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.
History.
"There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia."
"According to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi."
Kikuyu language.
"Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is ""Wi mwega?"" which means ""Are you fine?"". There are a few Kikuyu dialects depending on region. Kikuyus from Nyeri, for instance, have other forms of greeting including: ""Wakia Maitu"" greeting an elderly female, ""Wakia Awa"" greeting an elderly male, and ""Wanyua"" for agemates."
"The Kikuyu language is also similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though English and Kiswahili are the main languages spoken in Kenya across tribes, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride."
Famous Kikuyu people.
"Famous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)"
Incheon International Airport
"Incheon International Airport is the largest international airport in South Korea where all international flights leave and arrive every day. Gimpo Airport located near city Seoul used to be the international airport for Korea. However as the population grew and needs for places to stay increased in the area, Gimpo Airport no longer could expand its capacity to meet the growing demands for international flights. To solve the problem, a construction plan for a new 24 hour airport was started in 1992. Incheon International Airport is in Incheon City Jung-gu Unseo-dong (37°27′5″N, 126°26′4″E). Incheon International Airport Railroad (A'REX) and Incheon International Airport Highway were built to join the airport to Seoul. The airport is operated by Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC) and it is owned by the government of South Korea."
History.
"Incheon International Airport opened on March 29th, 2001. It was built on reclaimed land between Yongjongdo and Youngyudo. First stage of building started in 1992 and it took eight years and four months to finish. It cost 7.8 trillion Won. This allowed Incheon International Airport to have up to 170,000 flights, 27,000,000 passengers and 1,700,000 tons of cargo per year. Stage Two began in 2002 and was completed on June 20th 2008. The airport now has the capacity of holding 410,000 flights, 44,000,000 passengers, and 4,500,000 tons of cargo per year. When the airport is finished in 2020, it will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and four parallel runways. It will be able to have up to 100 million passengers, and 7 million tons of cargo per year."
Facilities.
"Incheon International Airport has passenger facilities (main passenger terminal, passenger concourse A), cargo terminal complex (A, B, C terminal), and operation facilities (control tower, runways, and meteorological facilities)."
Lao language
"Lao or Laotian is a language and is the official language of Laos. It is also spoken in the northeast part of Thailand. Lao, like the other languages of Laos, is written in an abugida writing system. The languages has variations, but the Vientiane dialect is considered the standard written form of Lao."
"Lao and Thai are both Tai languages and are very similar to each other. In fact, speakers of northern Thai dialects and Lao claim that they can largely understand each other, making the dialects mutually intelligible."
History.
"Lao is one of the Tai languages, spoken in what is now northern Vietnam and southern China. Mongol invaders and expansion in China pushed the Tai people south towards India. Their language was influenced by other languages in the region like the Mon-Khmer and the Austronesian languages. The written form of Lao originally came from the Pali language in India. The script form was brought to the region by Buddhists about two thousand years ago."
Vocabulary.
Other zinc compounds are:
Occurence.
"Five isotopes of zinc are found in nature. 64Zn is the most common isotope, with 48.63% of naturally occurring Zinc. This isotope has a half-life of 4.3x1018 years. This is so long, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, (0.6%), with a half life of 1.3x1016 years is usually considered to not be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are (28%), (4%) and (19%)."
"Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's crust. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. Sphalerite, a mineral that is made of zinc sulfide, is a main ore of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores."
"There are some other zinc ores, such as smithsonite (zinc carbonate) and a zinc silicate mineral. They are less common."
Preparation.
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by flotation. There is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide.
The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide.
The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate. This makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more.
"The zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed. This electrolysis makes oxygen, zinc, and sulfuric acid. This makes a pure zinc that is known as ""SHG"" or special high grade."
The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide.
Zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. This is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made.
This form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure.
Zinc is the fourth most commonly used metal in the world. About 10 million tons are made every year.
Uses.
As a metal.
Zinc is used in electrical batteries. The alkaline cell and the Leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most. It becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run.
"About 59% of zinc is used for corrosion prevention, which includes galvanizing. 47% of the world's zinc is used for galvanizing. This is used to protect another metal, usually iron, from rusting. The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron. The zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways. The metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc. The zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal. Dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice. It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a ""bullet"" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free."
"Zinc is used in alloys. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. Zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good bearings. Commercial bronze has zinc in it. Sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a semiconductor. Nickel silver is another zinc alloy."
"Zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ. An alloy of tin and lead was used in the past. Zinc is used in the US penny, which only has a thin layer of copper. The core is zinc. Older pennies were made completely out of bronze."
"A mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket. This reaction makes zinc sulfide, heat, light, and gases. Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars."
As zinc compounds.
About 1/4 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds. Zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment. Zinc oxide also is a semiconductor. Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot. Some fungicides have zinc in them. Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments. Zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light.
In biology.
"Humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well. If they do not get enough zinc in their food, they can get a mineral deficiency. Almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections. Some people say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Others say that zinc does not make a difference. There are medicines that one can use when they have a cold. People add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc. Most single-tablet vitamins have zinc in them. Zinc is found in at least 100 enzymes. It is the second most common transition metal other than iron. Zinc also is used by the brain. The human body contains 2 to 4 grams of zinc. A zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood. Whole wheat has much zinc in it."
Safety.
"Large amounts of zinc metal are toxic. It can dissolve in stomach acid. When too much zinc is eaten, copper and iron levels go down in the body. Zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach. Zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell."
Zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water.
Zebra
"Zebras are mammals of the family ""Equidae"". Zebras are African horses. They are in the same genus as the common horse, ""Equus caballus"", and donkeys. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main species of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra."
Appearance.
The most popular attractions are:
The Amazon rain forest.
"The amazon rain forest is a moist grassy land where many wild animals live and contains the amazon river which is the 2nd longest river in the world and has the largest volume of water. The world's longest river is the Nile in Africa. The forest is known as a rain forest as it rains very often but due to the dense surroundings not every droplet reaches the bottom. The Amazon is shared by eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname) and stretches for 6.7 million kilometers2. In the amazon rain forest, hundreds of thousands of trees have been cut down for wood and paper, meaning that the forest is endangered. Unlike the Boreial forest in Canada the trees are not getting replanted."
Bed
"A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on. It normally has a soft mattress on a bed frame. Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size."
History.
"In August 2020 archaeologists reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from Middle Paleolithic (at least 200,000 years ago). This was much older than the oldest previously known bedding."
"They found insect-repellent plants and ash layers beneath the bedding. This would have made a dirt-free, insulated base which helped to keep away insects. So early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried ferns)."
"Here's an example of what they said: ""Several cultures have used ash as an insect repellent because insects cannot easily move through fine powder. Ash blocks insects' breathing and biting apparatus, and eventually dehydrates them. ""Tarchonanthus"" (camphor bush) remains were on top of the grass from the oldest bedding in the cave. This plant is still used to deter insects in rural parts of East Africa""."
Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in Ancient Rome.
"In Ancient Egypt, beds were considered to be status symbols. While the lower classes simply slept on a heap of palm bows or straw, the wealthy constructed wood platform beds that were ascended by stairs, were often curtained, and piled high with cushions for comfort."
"In Ancient Rome, the bed was utilized as a multi-purpose reclining surface rather than just a place to sleep. Several beds, or ""dining couches"" were arranged around the perimeter of the home's living space, and friends and family would recline in bed while socializing, studying, and dining."
Types of beds.
"There are several kinds of bed in use today. Several terms refer to the size of the mattress. Some kinds are usually temporary, such as camp cots, air mattresses, and hammocks."
Asia
"Asia is a large region on Earth mainly in the northern hemisphere. Asia is connected to Europe in the west, forming a continent called Eurasia, though sometimes it is viewed as a separate continent from Europe. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. Asia was also home to some large empires such as the Persian Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Mongol Empire, and the Ming Empire. It is home to at least 44 countries. Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus are partly are also considered European."
Area.
"Asia includes a large amount of land. Covering about 30% of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent, with about 60% of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers."
"Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Pontic Mountains and the Turkish Straits. A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This line runs north–south down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea."
List of countries.
"Some countries are variously located in both Europe and Asia, namely Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, and Turkey."
"The Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in western Asia, with the rest of the country lying in North-East Africa."
Wall
"A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion, escape, and weather."
"Before powerful artillery was invented, many cities had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most city walls have been removed."
"The term ""the Wall"" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the Pink Floyd album of the same name."
"Sealing people behind walls, in the form of immurement has historically been a method of human sacrifice and punishment."
Retaining wall.
"A retaining wall is a structure made to hold soil from collapsing. It is made in special areas for any other construction work, such as farming or road making."
"The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling."
The third degree is a complete rupture.
Signs and symptoms.
The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation:
Joints involved.
"Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:"
Prevention.
"Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains."
Second Sino-Japanese War
"The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 to September 3, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It became part of World War II when Japan entered that war. Part of the Sino-Japanese war was fought in northern Burma and northeastern India. The war ended when Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It started in 1937 43 years after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 lead by Emperor Meiji who was the father of Emperor Taishō and the Grandfather of Hirohito ."
Invasion of China.
The Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war after the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said that a Japanese soldier got lost and they were allowed to find him in Beiping.
Japan invaded China for a few reasons:
"While the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the ""Chinese United Front"". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well."
Japanese occupation of China.
"In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beiping (now called Beijing), and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls."
"After six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied the industrial cities in southern China. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of ""using space to trade for time."" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight, and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China."
"Many soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back, instead of Japan continuing to take over the country."
End of the war 1941-1945.
"After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the area of fighting called the China-Burma-India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons."
"The Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. It had not been able to win the war against China quickly. Instead, Japan's military had already been fighting China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war."
"In China, the war had some important effects. It made more people support the Chinese Communist Party. It also made Chiang's Republic fall apart more quickly, in 1949."
Ligament
"In anatomy, the word ligament usually means the fibrous tissue that joins bones to other bones or cartilages."
"A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue made of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments join bones to other bones to form a joint. They do ""not"" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the amount of movement in a joint, or stop certain movements altogether."
"Ligaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple."
"The result of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined."
Powiat
"A county (Polish: ""powiat"", pronounced ""povyat""; plural, ""powiaty"") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a ""voivodship"" (in Polish, ""województwo"". One would call it in English ""province"")."
The ancient Greeks called the Great Pyramid one of the seven wonders of the world. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them are on the western side of the River Nile. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the Egyptian pharaohs went to the stars to join their gods in the afterlife.
Pyramids in the Americas.
The Aztecs and Mayans also built many massive pyramids. None are as old or big as the oldest or biggest Egyptian pyramids. Most of them are step pyramids.
"Unlike Egyptian pyramids, which were used as tombs for rulers and wealthy people, Aztec and Mayan pyramids are believed to have been used for public displays of human sacrifice."
Other pyramids.
"There are also ancient pyramids in other parts of Africa, Central America, Europe, North America, and Asia. There is a famous modern glass pyramid in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada is also a glass pyramid."
Care Bears
"The Care Bears are a very successful toy franchise from the 1980s. Over forty million of these stuffed teddy bears, made with a variety of colours, were sold from 1983 to 1987. Each Bear had a name, a job, and a symbol tied to it. For example, Funshine Bear helps people wake up, and has a sun on his stomach."
"The toys were first made as characters on cards in 1981; the original artwork was done by James Lewis. Later, other toys called the Care Bear Cousins were introduced."
"They also gave way to three animated movies for the cinema in the mid-1980s. A related TV series from DIC and, later, Canada's Nelvana Limited came out at almost that same time."
"Recently, Care Bear toys have been brought back in a new edition for the twenty-first century. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in their first two DVD movies (both computer-animated), as well as a few video games."
Bolzano
"Bolzano (; ; , Southern Bavarian: ""Bozn"") is the capital city of the province of Province of Bolzano-Bozen in northern Italy's Alto Adige."
Data.
"Its population is 98.057 (March 2005) and the area of the municipality is 52.34 km2. Bolzano has a history of Italian-speaking inhabitants since the Middle Ages. The region of Alto Adige/Südtirol is mainly German speaking, but in the city the Italian speaking population was the majority (75%) in 2001. The German speaking population of the city was 24% and the Ladin speaking less than 1%. Actually the foreign-born are around 7% (mostly are from eastern Europe)."
"Historically between the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated by neolatins from the time of the Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanisation. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present area of South Tyrol (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin. After the Italian victory in WWI the Italian government promoted a huge immigration of Italians in the city, that was fully modernized with new areas and with the creation of an industrial section: since then the Italians are the majority and in the 2011 census they were nearly 77% of the total population."
"Bolzano actually is an international city with a trilingual English-German-Italian university (Free University of Bolzano), the European Academy (EURAC), a Business Innovation Centre (BIC), an international airport (ABD, daily flights to Rome and Munich), the ""Bolzano Fair Area"", the Archaeology Museum with the Frozen Fritz (the Iceman called here Ötzi), other important museums, the famous ""Monumento alla Vittoria"" and an old Tyrolean medieval centre with the typical alpine arcades (""Portici""-Lauben)."
"Bolzano is the centre of the ""Euregio Tirol-Südtirol/Alto Adige-Trentino"" and with Innsbruck is the capital of the ""Alps Convention""."
City districts and neighboring communities.
Bolzano has five city districts:
"Communities next to Bozen are: Appiano, Cornedo, Laives, Deutschnofen, Renon, Genesio, Terlan, and Vadena."
"Other important towns near Bozen are: Bressanone, Brunico and Merano."
Flubber
"Flubber is a 1997 American science-fiction comedy film directed by Les Mayfield (who had previously directed another John Hughes scripted remake, ""Miracle on 34th Street"") and written by Hughes, based on an earlier screenplay by Bill Walsh. A remake of ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" (1961), the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton, and Clancy Brown with Jodi Benson providing a voice. The film grossed $178 million worldwide despite negative reviews. In selected theaters, the ""Pepper Ann"" episode ""Old Best Friend"" was featured before the film."
Mary Wollstonecraft
"Mary Wollstonecraft (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was a British writer. She was born in Spitalfields, a daughter of a rich farmer who inherited his fortune. Her father was known because he was sometimes violent towards her, her four siblings, and their mother when his farms failed. Mary Wollstonecraft was the second oldest child in her family. She was the oldest female child. She left home at the age of nineteen to work and become independent."
"Working in the English city of Bath, Somerset, she developed a disliking for the upper class and their social lives. In 1784 she experienced the near death of her sister Eliza who was also the victim of abuse at the hands of her husband. She escaped with her sister to London to preserve her life. Soon after, her good friend Fanny Blood, died of complications in childbirth. Wollstonecraft suffered depression following this and being in financial straits, she began to write her first book ""Thoughts on the Education of Daughters"". Then she wrote """"."
"The population of Trieste, practically nearly all Italian, promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918, and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called ""Venezia Giulia""."
"The population is 207.069 ab. (2004). It was nearly 300,000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus."
"These days, Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry, science parks, universities and ""history on the border of western Europe"". Trieste will be connected to the Italian ""TAV railway"" (High Speed) network: a 300 km/hour (186 mph) fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next few years."
Economy.
"During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the city's annexation to Italy following World War I, because it was cut off from the ""Mittleurope""."
"But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous ""Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)""). Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards)."
"As a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has had a huge economic boom, thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal, steel works and an oil terminal."
"Trieste is also Italy's and Mediterranean's (and one of Europe's) greatest coffee ports, as the city supplies more than 40% of Italy's coffee. Coffee brands, such as Illy, were founded and are headquartered in the city. Currently, Trieste is one of Europe's most important ports and centres for trade and transport, with Trieste being part of the ""Corridor 5"" plan, to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries."
Offenbach am Main
"Offenbach is a city in the German state of Hesse. It is on the river Main near Frankfurt am Main. The city has about 120,000 people. The ""Deutscher Wetterdienst"" (German weather service) is in Offenbach."
Economy.
"Until the early 1970s the economy of Offenbach was mainly the machine-building and leather industries. The city is the home of the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies until today."
Twinned cities.
Offenbach has the following twin cities:
Heilbronn
"Heibronn ( ]; , local dialect: ""Hallbrunn"", ""Haalbrunn"") is a city in Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. With about 117,000 people, Heilbronn is the sixth largest town in Baden-Württemberg."
Heilbronn is also on the river Neckar and is known for the wine which was grown in their region and the Kätchen a famous sign.
Hildesheim
"is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30 km southeast of Hanover. The city is on the banks of the River Innerste, which is a smaller river that flows into the River Leine. It can be reached from Autobahn A7, which links Kassel, Göttingen and Hanover."
"It has about 110,000 people living there."
History.
"Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany. The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford, where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (""Alter Markt""), which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important. The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000. When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well. In 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province."
"The city was bombed in World War II, but the bombing had little importance in the course of the war. 28.5% of the houses were destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses had no damage. The center, which still had its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Fortunately, most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began. Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down. Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place."
Population history.
¹ census data
Pforzheim
Pforzheim () is a city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg.
"About 116,000 people live there."
The town has a railway station on the Welsh Marches Line.
Panthera
Panthera is a genus of the family Felidae.
"It has five living species, which are the biggest cats in the Felidae. The tiger is the largest ""Panthera"" species, and the largest of all cats. The leopard is the smallest ""Panthera"" species."
"Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the ""Panthera"", a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008. The genus ""Neofelis"" is also closely related."
Superpower
"A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a great power and less powerful than a hyperpower. Right now, only the United States is a superpower. However, China may become a superpower in the future. Some say it is already one. Others say that it will not become a superpower."
"In the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs – those who would be able to start a nuclear war – were all given ""permanent"" seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union."
"For most of the 1900s, the Soviet Union was a superpower. After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, it was not a superpower anymore. Russia got most of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and also its permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries also have nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power. The Republic of India, and Pakistan are a few countries like this. In order to be a superpower, a country must dominate economic, cultural, and military as well as diplomatic influence."
Snow leopard
"The snow leopard (""Panthera uncia""), also known as the Irbis and ounce, is a feline, which lives in central Asia. It used to be thought not to be closely related to the smaller leopard, which is why they were put in different genera before. However, recent research has discovered this is not correct. The cat is closely related to the other big cats in the genus ""Panthera""."
Appearance.
"Snow leopards are about 2-5 meters long in the body, and have a 90-100 centimeter long tail. They weigh up to 75 kilograms. They have grey and white fur with dark rosettes and spots, and their tails have stripes. Its fur is very long and thick to protect it against the cold. Their feet are also big and furry, which helps them to walk on snow more easily. They use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill."
Voice.
"They are one of the cats which cannot purr: ""In five cat species (lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard and snow leopard) the epihyoideum is an elastic ligament, whereas in all other species of the Felidae the epihyal is completely ossified (bony)... those felids with an elastic epihyoid are able to roar but not purr, while species with a completely ossified hyoid are able to purr but not to roar"". Despite this, it seems now that snow leopards cannot roar, though they can make a number of other sounds."
Hunting.
"Snow leopards are well camouflaged, and are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk). They stalk and eat medium-sized prey like Ibex, bharal (mountain sheep) and wild goats. It can survive on a single sheep for two weeks."
"Snow leopards prefer to ambush prey from above, using broken terrain to conceal their approach. They try to land on the sheep, and kill it directly. If the sheep runs, they pursue it down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of their initial leap to chase prey for up to ."
"They kill with a bite to the neck, and may drag the prey to a safe location before feeding. They consume all edible parts of the carcass, and can survive on a single bharal (blue sheep) for two weeks before hunting again. Annual prey needs is 20–30 adult bharals."
Habitats.
"In summer, snow leopards usually live above the tree line on mountainous meadows and in rocky regions at altitudes from . In winter, they come down into the forests to altitudes around . Snow leopards prefer broken terrain, and can travel without difficulty in snow up to deep, although they prefer to use existing trails made by other animals."
"They live alone. After a pregnancy of about a hundred days the female gives birth to 2 or 3 cubs. Snow leopards are protected in most of the countries they live in. However, people do still kill them for their fur, or to protect their cattle."
Distribution.
"The snow leopard has a huge range in central Asia. It is in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kashmir, Kunlun, and the Himalaya to southern Siberia, Mongolia, and Tibet."
"Since many estimates are rough and outdated, its numbers could be falsely viewed as low. The total wild population of the snow leopard was estimated in 2008 as 4,510 to 7,350 individuals."
Taxonomy and evolution.
"The snow leopard was not thought closely related to the ""Panthera"" or other living big cats. However, recent molecular studies put the species firmly in the genus ""Panthera"": its closest relative is the tiger (""Panthera tigris""). MSW3 still refers to the snow leopard as ""Uncia uncia"", but the more recent IUCN classifies it as Panthera uncia."
In popular culture.
The snow leopard is an official symbol of Kazakhstan.
"On 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown."
"A local industry using the fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully reestablished in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. However, the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres and the last flax industry closed in 1965."
"In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938."
1981 to present.
"In 1981, the British governmente changed the status of Saint Helena and the other Crown colonies to ""British Dependent Territories""."
"In 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha."
"Geography, plants and animals."
"The island of Saint Helena has a total area of . The centre is covered by forest, of which some has been planted. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena Plover or Wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the islets near the coast."
"The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak () at . In 1996 it became the island's first national park. In 2000 a project began to replant part of the lost Great Wood, called the Millennium Forest, and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust, established in 2002."
"There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre of the shore."
"The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena Plover, known locally as the Wirebird. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag."
Climate.
"The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by trade winds that blow almost continuously."
Administrative divisions.
"Saint Helena is divided into eight districts. People that works and lives in the Jamestown Harbour and in the Royal Mail Ship ""St. Helena"" (RMS) are included in the census in their work places (see reference)."
Economy.
"The island had an economy of only one crop until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string. St Helena's economy is now weak, and is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government."
The tourist industry is heavily based on the presence of Napoleon in the island.
"Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports ""Tungi Spirit"", made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, ""Opuntia ficus-indica"" (""Tungi"" is the local St Helenian name for the plant). Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income."
Banking and currency.
"Saint Helena has its own currency, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling. The government of Saint Helena produces coins and banknotes. The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and in Georgetown, Ascension Island."
Helicopter
A helicopter (also often used: chopper or heli) is a kind of flying machine or aircraft. A helicopter lifts up off
"of the ground and moves because of its rotors. A rotor is several small wings, called rotor blades, that spin together around a shaft. For that reason, helicopters are sometimes called ""rotary-wing aircraft"". A helicopter flies differently from an airplane. An airplane must move forward to stay in the air, but because the helicopter's rotor blades are always moving, the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground. Not needing a runway, they can land in places where an airplane cannot. Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades, which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted."
History.
"Since around 400 BC, the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a children's toy. The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air. Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick. Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490, and drew pictures of his ideas. It was hundreds of years later (in the early 20th century) before anyone built one that could really fly. The first practical helicopters were built by Frenchman Louis Breguet in 1935 and by German Henrich Focke in 1936. A Russian immigrant, Igor Sikorsky, built and perfected the first practical helicopter in America in 1939."
Uses.
"Helicopters are especially useful when there are disasters when infrastructure is damaged. Food packets, water, medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road. When people are injured, helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road."
"Helicopters are also used by the military, because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them. Attack helicopters act as attack aircraft carrying and shooting guns and missiles."
Training helicopter is used for learning how to be a helicopter pilot.
"After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:"
SR Class 4Lav
The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.
SR Class 6Pul
"The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6Pul, 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935 (the Cor designation was later used for 4Cor units)."
British Rail Mark 3
"British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s."
Desiro
Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.
"The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort."
Austria.
"In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called ""ÖBB 5022"". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff."
Bulgaria.
"In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas."
Denmark.
"In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains."
Germany.
"Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these ""Class 642"" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs."
"The ""Class 642"" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the ""Müglitzbahn"", have made greater passenger numbers."
"At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the ""Class 642"" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the ""Class 643""."
Hungary.
"Right now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton."
Malaysia.
The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.
These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.
Romania.
"Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: """"Regio"", ""InterRegio"" and ""InterCity"" inter-city services, but mostly on its ""InterRegio"""" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes."

Tendons are often connected to joints.
Coffee substitute
"Coffee substitutes are products that try to taste like coffee. The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee, but has no caffeine in it. The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical, economic and barbaric. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, however it tasted foul. It was also hard to get. In the American Civil War there was a similar story -"
"""For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value, there is unfortunately no substitute; the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain, and cheat the palate, if we cannot deceive the nerves."" The Southern Banner, 1865"
Ingredients.
Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances.
"Some ingredients used include: almond, acorn, asparagus, barley and malt, beech nut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, cotton seed, dandelion root, fig, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel, rye, sassafras nut, sweet potato."
"Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970, and it has become a mainstream product. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides. Chicory is a native plant of Western Asia, Europe, and Northern Africa. And the cultivation of the plant is considered to be originated in Egypt. In France, around the 1800s, chicory was used as an ingredient or substitute for coffee."
"Postum is an instant type beverage used in place of coffee. It made from roasted grains and molasses. Postum history goes back to 1895 when an American named C.W. Post created the coffee substitute, inspired by a caramel coffee recipe made by Harvey Kellogg. It reached the height of its popularity during World War II. It also really caught on with people who for health or religious reasons preferred not to consume drinks that contained caffeine. For popular usage on the sitcom Seinfeld George says to Jerry he does not know why postum is not a more popular beverage."
Kuzcham Dherai
"Kuzcham Dherai (also sometimes called Dherai, Dehrai or Derai) is a town in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It is located on the bank of the river Swat and a couple of miles away from Swat Saidu Sharif airport. The population of Dherai is about 10,000 people."
History.
It is believed that Alexander the Great once passed through this area.

Croatian language
The Croatian language is spoken mainly throughout the countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the surrounding countries of Europe.
"Croatian grammar is the grammar of the Croatian language. The Croatian language consists of three vernaculars (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian)."
"Croatian grammar books show that the codification of the language started at the beginning of the 17th century (the first grammar was written by Bartol Kašić in Latin in 1604). This means that the rules for the language were written down. From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars. Most of them described the Štokavian dialect, but some were about Kajkavian. In the 19th century, more grammars based on Štokavian were written. They were ""Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka"", written by Šime Starčević (1812), and ""Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache"", written by Ignjat Alojzije Brlić (1833). Even before the 19th century, the three dialects of the Croatian language were almost equally used. However, the way each dialect was written down varied throughout Croatia. Near the Adriatic coast, it was more similar to Italian, and near the Hungarian border, it was more similar to Hungarian."
"All grammars of the above period (1604-1836) used three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Starčević's grammar is an exception as it uses a system of four accents."
"In 19th century, Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (č,ž,š,ľ,ň,ď and ǧ). The letters that were accepted were č, ž and š, and from Polish, ć. For other phonemes (sounds), the digraphs that were accepted were ie, lj, nj and dž. Later dj or gj was changed to đ (according to proposal by Đuro Daničić)."
Orthography.
"The Croatian language uses a Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong ""ie"" or ""ije"", and ""ŕ"". This system is called ""gajica"" in Croatian (or Croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet). The name came from Ljudevit Gaj. The letter order (and whole alphabet) is called ""abeceda"" in Croatian, because the first 4 letters are spelled ""a, be, ce, de"". For writing foreign names and words, and in some professions, the Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to ""gajica"", like ""X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon)"" and others."
Croatian alphabet (Gaica) 1830.c
Grammatical cases.
"In Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. For people who are learning Croatian, declension is the most difficult part of the language to master. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension, including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension now remains. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called padeži (plural) and padež (singular)."
The question you will ask yourself here is: “Where is Krešimir going?”. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.

"In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's request. Schröder had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005."
"In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing a bill. It would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as president, Köhler was authorized to not sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006, he did not sign the Consumer Information Law, because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills. In most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history."
"In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector, stating that ""a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs""."
"On 22 May 2008, Köhler said, that he wants to be the candidate for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009, he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly, and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009."
"In November 2009, Köhler refused to sign the ""Zugangserschwerungsgesetz"" (Access Impediment Act) into law without further information. The law, which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography, is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional."
Resignation.
"On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:"
"He came under criticism for his statement that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade. He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position. After getting no support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010. He made a statement saying ""I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect."" The resignation was considered a ""surprise"". The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position."
"As written down in the German constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens Böhrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010."
Personal life.
"Horst Köhler is married to Eva Köhler, a teacher. They have two children, a daughter Ulrike (born in 1972) and a son Jochen (born in 1977). His daughter, who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, became blind as a teenager. Horst Köhler is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany."

Oiran
"were courtesans in Japan. Oiran were part of Japanese society during the Edo Period, (1600–1868). Prostitution was legal then, but only in special neighborhoods that were closed to outsiders. There were different kinds of oiran, depending on their beauty, skills in art, education, and more. High-ranking oiran were called . Only nobles could be with one. Tayū had many servants, and when they went outside, their servants carried them and followed them, making a procession. They wore very expensive clothes and jewelry. Any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette."
Geisha replaced oiran. Geisha practiced common types of entertainment enjoyed by the people of that time. They became more popular than oiran. The last known oiran was in 1761. A few women still practice the arts of the oiran today (without sex) to continue the cultural heritage.
Ryōtei
"A is a type of very expensive and elegant Japanese restaurant. Traditionally they only accept new customers who are recommended by known and trusted clients. They usually include entertainment by geisha, but not always in modern times. Ryōtei are usually a place where very important business or political meetings can take place in private."
Philharmonia
The Philharmonia is an orchestra from London.
History.
"The orchestra was formed in 1945 by Walter Legge. Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies."
"In 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life."
"In 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the ""New Philharmonia Orchestra"". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9"", conducted by Klemperer."
"The orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since."
"Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008."
Concerts Today.
"Today, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam."
Recordings.
"The Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"", and David Lean's film version of ""Oliver Twist"" (1948)."
Taiko
"means simply ""drum"" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is used to refer to any of the different kinds of Japanese drums (, ""wadaiko"", ""Japanese drum"" in Japanese) and to the more or less new art of taiko drumming bands (sometimes better called, ""kumi-daiko"", ). The taiko drum originated in the country of Japan. This drum was created by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. The taiko drum makes a very loud, deep sound."
"In a traditional Japanese village the ""odaiko"" (big drum) defined the extent of the village land. In modern Japan, wadaiko has become more of a performance art, seen only during festivals or in concert. The most famous Wadaiko performance group are 'Kodo' (meaning heart-beat). They are not only the worlds most respected Japanese drumming group, they also maintain many traditional art forms. They group lives on the island 'Sado Higashima' and live together as a community in a traditional way. Many other cultures have adopted this style of drumming, from Germany and the United States to Australia."
Kitagawa Utamaro
"Kitagawa Utamaro (;  – 31 October 1806), also called Utamaro, was a Japanese artist. He was a master of the ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting."
Career.
"Utamaro is known for his studies of women (""bijinga""). He also made nature studies."
His work was popular in Europe. He influenced artists in Europe who were called Impressionists.
"Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show or simply just Dr. Hook was an American band. They formed in Union City, New Jersey in 1968. Their two best known songs were ""Cover of the Rolling Stone"" and ""Sylvia's Mother""."
Glider
"Gliders are aircrafts which do not have a motor. Gliders are controlled by their pilots by using control-sticks. Some gliders can only carry one person; others can carry two. In gliders with two seats, each pilot has a control-stick. Gliders always have seats for the pilots."
'Sailplanes' are gliders with long wings so that they will only lose height slowly. In some places a vertical draft makes the air go up faster than the glider is going down. The pilot of a glider can make it climb by flying to these places. This is called soaring. Good pilots can travel long distances by always finding rising air. Some pilots race each other over hundreds of kilometres each day. Other pilots just fly for fun.
Gliders cannot get into the air by themselves. They are pulled into the air by an aircraft with a motor or they are pulled up by motor on the ground.
"There are two other types of gliders. Hang-gliders have frames to give the wings their shape, but do not have seats for their pilots and do not have control-sticks. The wings of paragliders are like parachutes and so do not have frames to give them their shape. These other two types of glider are often launched from the tops of hills or cliffs."
John Stuart Mill
"John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873) was an English philosopher and political economist. He was a classical liberal thinker of the 19th century. He was for utilitarianism, the ethical theory first proposed by his third godfather Jeremy Bentham."
"As a utilitarian, he believed that the good of society as a whole is more important than the pleasure of one or a few individuals."
Jeremy Bentham
"Jeremy Bentham (15 February 1748 – 6 June 1832) was an English, jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He is best known as one of the first people to be for utilitarianism and animal rights and gay rights."
"Bentham was one of the most influential (classical) liberals, partially through his writings but particularly through his students all around the world, including John Stuart Mill and several political leaders (and Robert Owen, who later started the idea of socialism). He is believed to be the innovator of classical liberalism, a term first coined in the 19th century. After he died, his body was preserved and is on public display at University College London to this day."
Dinosaur Comics
"Dinosaur Comics is a comic by Ryan North. It shows dinosaurs who have adventures and talk about philosophy and some other topics. The art is the same every day, but the words are different. This comic is intended to be funny."
Things in the comic that are not true:
Lucid dream
"A lucid dream is essentially a dream in which the person is aware that he is in the dream. In a lucid dream, the person does not have to be in control of his surroundings for the dream to be lucid, and only being aware of the dream itself is sufficient condition for the dream to be described as lucid."
"The art of lucid dreaming is the art of being able to control your surroundings in the dream itself. People who lucid dream can usually control everything that happens in their dream. They can teleport, fly, make something appear, or even make everything disappear. Regular lucid dreamers usually do so for spiritual reasons but there certainly are people who do it for fun or to avoid bad dreams."
Ways to lucid dream.
"Although some people can have lucid dreams without trying, most people do not have them often. It is important to be able to remember dreams, because if the dreamer does not remember them, he or she will not know if they were lucid dreams or not. Remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up."
"There are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely. Stephen LaBerge, a psychologist who studies lucid dreams, made the MILD (mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming) technique. To do this, the dreamer must wake up after having a dream, and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again, except now knowing it is a dream. The dreamer should think ""the next time I am dreaming, I want to remember I am dreaming"", and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep."
There are many other ways to help someone lucid dream. One other way is to fall asleep while keeping the mind awake. This is called the WILD (wake induced lucid dreaming) technique. It is easiest to perform after waking up from a few hours of sleep.
My Fair Lady
"My Fair Lady is a musical. It is based on George Bernard Shaw's play, ""Pygmalion"", and on the movie adaptation of the play starring Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard. The book and lyrics for the musical were written by Alan Jay Lerner. The music was written by Frederick Loewe."
Synopsis.

Erlasee Solar Park
"The Erlasee Solar Park is in one of the sunniest regions of Germany. On the former wine-producing Erlasee estate near Arnstein in Bavaria, in southern Germany, SOLON has constructed what is currently the largest tracking photovoltaic solar power station in the world with an output of 12 MW. Just under 1,500 ""SOLON-Movers"" modules convert sunlight into environmentally friendly power, generating as much as the average consumption of the nearby town of Arnstein."
The solar power plant cost £35 million and covers 77 hectares of land.
Khula
Khula is the right of a woman to ask her husband for a divorce and to offer him a compensation in case he does so. Following the Sharia the husband has no right to ask for a compensation of a higher value than that what he gave his wife when they married.
"After divorce the former husband is responsible for education, food and residence of children. The children live with the mother for 7 years. After 7 years children have the right to live with father or mother, as they decide."
Hashemi Rafsanjani
"Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (, ""Akbar Hāshemī Rafanjānī""), Hashemi Bahramani (; August 25, 1934 – January 8, 2017) was an influential Iranian politician. He has been the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2017."
"""Forbes"" magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he ""has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years."" His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of ""Akbar Shah"" in Iran."
"Rafsanjani was President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996."
"Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however."
"Rafsanjani died on January 8, 2017 in Tehran from a heart attack, aged 82."
Evander Holyfield
"Evander Holyfield (born October 19, 1962) is an American boxer. He held both the world heavyweight championship and the world cruiserweight championship. He also won a bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics."

"Porthmadog Football Club is a football team, playing in the League of Wales. The club was started in 1884."
Sharia
"Sharia, Sharia law or Islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic culture. The Arabic word ""sharīʿah"" () refers to the revealed law of God and originally meant ""way"" or ""path""."
"Classical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life, including religious rituals, family life, business, crimes, and warfare. In former times, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists, who based their legal opinions on Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Some parts of sharia can be described as ""law"" in the usual sense of that word, while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
Modern countries in the Muslim world all have their own laws. In most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia. Muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world.
Meaning and origins.
"People of different religions who speak Arabic use the word ""sharīʿah"" to describe a religious tradition that comes from teachings of prophets. Christians and Jews in the Middle East have used it to describe their own religion. For many Muslims the word ""sharia"" means simply ""justice"". They will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society."
"Most Muslims think that sharia should be interpreted by experts in Islamic law. In Arabic, the word ""sharīʿah"" refers to God's revelation, which does not change. In contrast, the rules of behavior created by scholars as they try to understand God's revelation are called ""fiqh"". These rules can change and Islamic scholars have often disagreed about them."

Homestead is a city of southeastern Florida in the United States. It was devastated when Hurricane Andrew traveled over the area in August 1992.
Barry Marshall
"Barry James Marshall, AC, FRS, FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian doctor and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria ""Helicobacter pylori"" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University."
Early years.
"Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion."
Life and research.
"In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of ""H. pylori"". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that ""Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right"". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the ""H. pylori"" idea could be proved."
"Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between ""H. pylori"" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal."
"After this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at ""H. pylori"" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA."
Awards and honours.
"In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium ""Helicobacter pylori"" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease."
Marshall was given other awards including:
He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.
Diglossia
"Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use. One is the common language they use every day, and the other is either a much older version from centuries before (for example, Arabic or Chinese) or a similar but clearly different modern-day version (for example, Norwegian with Bokmål and Nynorsk)."
Mutual intelligibility
Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are alike. This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different languages or different dialects.
"There are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and spelling between British and General American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible."
"Sometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani, the official language of British India until India became independent. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu."
"Also, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin, Shanghainese/Wu Chinese, and Cantonese/Yue in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other."
His importance in English music.
"Some of Vaughan Williams’s best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song. He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called ""On Wenlock Edge"" for tenor, piano and string quartet. His music always sounds English. He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good. Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar (who was a little older) made people realise that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful, moving music."

Recycling
"Recycling is when you recover scrap or waste and reprocessing the material into useful products. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are often recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting."
"It is important not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out."
"Recycling reduces trash in landfills and incinerators. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, ""The Economist"" says. Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world."
"The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle."
Plastic recycling.
"Most people make about two kilograms of waste (trash) every day, and about 7% of this waste is made up of plastic products that can be recycled. Today, plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables, park benches, and even high-chairs."
Sort it out.
"First, plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center, where it is ""sorted out"". When plastic is sorted out, symbols have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used. There are two types of plastic: ""polyethylene"" and ""polymer"". There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic, too: ""high density polyethylene"" (HDPE), and ""low density polyethylene"" (LDPE). HDPE plastic is usually used to make furniture, and LDPE plastic are usually things like milk jugs, plastic and grocery bags."
Grinding washing.
"HDPE plastic is ground into a small powder. LDPE plastic, which are usually thin films, need to be ground by a special machine. After that, both plastics are washed with hot water and detergent. Dirt and other things, like labels, are taken off. After the wash, the powder is dried with hot air."
"Sometimes, the powder is sold. But other times, the powder is heated, colored, and then put into a ""pelletizer"". The pelletizer makes the powder into little pellets, which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic ""wood"". This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots, trash cans, pipes, picnic tables, benches, toys, mats, and many other things."
Transnistria
"Transnistria, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR; ), is a de facto country in Eastern Europe. It came to be between 1990 and 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Transnistria declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a ""frozen conflict"" area. Currently, no state recognises Transnistria, officially the territory is part of Moldova."
"There is argument about whether Transnistria is really a country or not. It is recognized by three other unrecognized or partly recognized states: Abkhazia, Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The area continues to claim independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries."
"In a vote on 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the area the ""Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester""."
Transnistria is the only state to still use the hammer and sickle symbol on its flag.
"Russia has a big influence on the territory. Between 1.500 and 2.000 Ruassian soldiers are stationed on the territory. In addition, there may be up to 10.000 paramilitary troops."
"Moldovans, Russians, and Ukraians make up about a third of the population each."
Mercalli intensity scale
"The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, they classify earthquakes by the effects they have (and the destruction they cause). When there is little damage, the scale describes how people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it."
"Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale."
Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic.
"Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902, Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels. August Heinrich Sieberg completely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale."
"Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. Charles Francis Richter also edited it. He also developed the Richter scale, later on."
"On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Garland to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia."
"Garland has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. He is the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1971."
"After Republicans refused to give Garland a confirmation hearing, Garland's nomination was expired in January 2017 shortly before the inauguration of Donald Trump. Trump said he will announce his Justice nominee for the Supreme Court on January 31, 2017."
United States Attorney General.
"On January 6, 2021, then President-elect Joe Biden said that we would nominate Garland to be the United States Attorney General during his administration."
"On March 1, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15-7 to advance Garland's nomination to a full Senate vote. On March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland by a vote of 70-30 to become the next Attorney General."
Personal life.
"Garland married Lynn in 1977. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland."
Article Three of the United States Constitution
"Article Three of the United States Constitution creates the judicial branch of the United States government. It creates the Supreme Court of the United States, and allows the United States Congress to create less powerful federal courts. It also sets out the powers that these courts have."
Section 1: Federal courts.
"Section 1 of Article Three starts out by creating the Supreme Court one court that will be more powerful than any other court in the country. It also gives Congress the power to create ""inferior"" (less powerful) federal courts."
It allows judges in these courts to get a regular salary for their work. Section 1 protects the judges by saying that their salaries will not be decreased while they are in office (working as a federal judge).
Tenure.
"Section 1 says that judges ""shall hold their Offices [keep their jobs] during good Behavior."" This is meant to protect federal judges, and also to make sure that the federal judiciary is independent."
"Before it won its independence in the American Revolutionary War, America was a colony of the British Empire. The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution just four years after the War ended. They still remembered what the courts in the American colonies were like. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, Britain's King George III ""made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries."""
"This meant that the judges could not be independent or impartial. If they made a decision that King George did not like, they could be fired, or not paid. Judges who wanted to keep their jobs made decisions based on what King George would want, not based on what the law said. If judges are cannot be independent, or do not follow they law, courts are not fair, and there is no way for regular people to get justice."
"The Constitution makes sure that this will not happen to United States federal judges. By saying judges ""shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,"" Section 1 is basically allowing judges to keep their jobs for the rest of their lives. In , the Constitution does say that Congress can take away a judge's job but only after being convicted in a trial, and only for ""Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."" (This is what Section 1 means by behavior that is not ""good."") In other words, the Constitution makes sure that all judges will lose their jobs for making even the slightest unpopular decision. This denies judges the freedom to be independent, and to make the decisions that they think are fair, and makes them choose between right and reelection."
Number of courts.
"Article III clearly allows only one Supreme Court. However, it does not say how many Supreme Court Justices (judges) there should be. Congress solved this problem in 1948 by passing a law. The law says that the Supreme Court will have 9 Justices, including one Chief Justice."
"In both Section 1 and in , the Constitution gives Congress the right to create courts that are ""inferior"" to the Supreme Court. However, the Constitution does not say how many ""inferior"" courts there should be, or how they should be set up. It leaves those decisions to Congress. Congress decided to create two different kinds of ""inferior"" courts (also called ""lower courts""). In the Judiciary Act of 1789, they created:"
"Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury."
Clause 1: Cases and controversies.
"Clause 1 of Section 2 explains the powers the federal court has, and the limits of those powers."
"Clause 1 gives the federal courts the power to hear and judge actual ""cases and controversies"" only. For example, they cannot hear a case about a situation that might come up in the future."
Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction.
"When Clause 2 talks about ""jurisdiction,"" it is talking about who has the power to hear a case."
Original jurisdiction.
"""Original jurisdiction"" is the power to hear a case first, before any other court. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in:"
Appellate jurisdiction.
"In all the other cases mentioned in Clause 2, the Supreme Court has ""appellate jurisdiction."" That means another court has the power to hear the case first. If somebody appeals that court's decision, the Supreme Court can take the case on appeal. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court the power to hear appeals on:"
Martha Wright
"Martha Wright, born Martha Lucile Wiederrecht (March 23, 1923 – March 1, 2016), was an American actress and singer. She performed on Broadway and on television. She was in ""South Pacific"" and ""The Sound of Music""."
"Wright died at the age of 92 in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 1, 2016."
Thomas G. Morris
"Thomas Gayle Morris (August 20, 1919 – March 4, 2016) was an American politician. He was born in Eastland County, Texas. Morris served in the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1953 to 1958. He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1958. Morris began serving on January 3, 1959, and left office January 3, 1969, after being defeated for re-election."
"Morris died in Amarillo, Texas on March 4, 2016 at the age of 96."
Morgan F. Murphy
"Morgan Francis Murphy (April 16, 1932 – March 4, 2016) was an American politician. He was born in Chicago, Illinois. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives representing Illinois's 2nd district. He served from 1973 through 1981. He replaced Abner J. Mikva. He later served as a U.S. representative for Illinois's 3rd district. He served from 1971 through 1973."
"Murphy died in Chicago, Illinois from prostate cancer on March 4, 2016. He was aged 83."
Article Five of the United States Constitution
Article Five of the United States Constitution outlines how the Constitution can be changed. Changes to the Constitution are called Constitutional amendments.
"Article Five also says that there are certain clauses, or parts, of Article One of the Constitution that could not be amended right away. These clauses are explained in the ""Protected clauses"" section."
Background.
"Before the Constitution was approved, the United States was covered by its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation."
"Under the Articles of Confederation, amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures. Not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment. If a single state Senator or Representative in the country disagreed with an amendment, the amendment would fail. This made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed."
"When the Founding Fathers wrote Article Five, they were trying to make sure changing the Constitution was not too hard, but not too easy either. James Madison later explained that the amendment process in the Constitution ""guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults."""
"In Simple English, Madison meant that the amendment process protects equally against:"
Step 1: Proposing an amendment.
There are two steps in the process for changing the Constitution. The first step is proposing (formally suggesting) an amendment. Article Five of the Constitution allows this to be done in two different ways.
"The first way is the most common way. Any member of Congress can suggest an amendment. However, two-thirds (67%) of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives have to agree that the amendment is needed. If this happens, the proposed amendment moves to Step 2 in the process."
"As of 2020, the second way has never been used. However, it exists to protect the rights of the state legislatures. If two-thirds of the state legislatures ask them to, Congress has to call a Constitutional Convention. Delegates would come to the Convention from each state. The Constitutional Convention could propose as many amendments as they wanted to. All of the amendments they proposed would move to Step 2 in the process."
"At first, when the Founding Fathers were writing the Constitution, they were only going to give Congress the power to propose amendments. However, some of the Founders, like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, worried that this gave Congress too much power. Madison and Hamilton re-wrote Article Five to add the second option for proposing an amendment, and the rest of the Founders agreed. Adding the second option helped make sure the states had power too the power to propose amendments if enough of their legislatures agreed."
Step 2: Ratifying the amendment.
"Step 2 starts when an amendment has been proposed, either by Congress or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment now has to be ratified. Like with Step 1, Article Five gives two choices for how an amendment can be ratified. Congress gets to choose which way to use."
"Congress has almost always chosen the first way: letting the state legislatures ratify the amendment. If three-fourths (75%) of the state legislatures ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"The second option is for Congress to ask each state to create a ""ratifying convention."" This is a group of people not members of the state legislature who would decide whether or not to ratify the amendment. If ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"Congress has only used the second option once: after it proposed the 21st Amendment. (This amendment cancelled the 18th Amendment, which made alcohol illegal in the United States. The 21st Amendment made alcohol legal again.)"
"At the time, Congress thought that this would be the more democratic option. A large majority of the people in the United States wanted the 21st Amendment to pass. However, Congress thought the state legislators would refuse to pass the amendment because of pressure from powerful groups that were against alcohol. In other words, Congress did not think that the state legislatures would vote the way the people of the United States would want. This example shows why the Founding Fathers included the ""ratifying convention"" option in the amendment process. If the state legislatures get too powerful, or do not represent what the people who elected them want, the people have the power to pass amendments too."
People have different ideas about the Bible. Christians believe it is God's Word to people. The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God. Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are God's Word. Catholics also believe that the books called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible. Sometimes different denominations disagree over exactly what the Bible means.
"According to Islam, the Injil itself is to be followed but it is believed to have been corrupted with time. The Qur'an is believed to be the successor."
"Atheists do not believe that gods exist, so the Bible is only an ancient book."
"Deists believe in God, but they believe that the Bible was written by people, so they don't see it as important."
Bavaria
"Bavaria (; , ), officially the Free State of Bavaria (, ; ), is a State (""Bundesland"") of Germany. The territory of this state is the largest of the 16 German states. The state capital is Munich with 1.3 million people. About 12.5 million people live in Bavaria."
"Like many German states, Bavaria was once independent. Ludwig II of Bavaria was its last independent king. Bavaria joined the German Empire in 1871."
Structure.
"Bavaria has seven parts: ""Oberbayern"" (Upper Bavaria), ""Niederbayern"" (Lower Bavaria), ""Schwaben"" (Swabia), ""Mittelfranken"" (Middle Franconia), ""Unterfranken"" (Lower Franconia), ""Oberfranken"" (Upper Franconia) and ""Oberpfalz"" (Upper Palatinate). Bavaria has 71 districts and 25 free cities."
"The highest point is the Zugspitze, which is also the highest mountain in Germany. Munich is the largest city, the second biggest city is Nuremberg (""Nürnberg""), which is famous for its gingerbread, a kind of Christmas bread that is often shaped like a Christmas tree, a snowman or Santa Claus."
Pope Benedict XVI was born in Bavaria.
Administrative divisions.
Administrative regions.
"Bavaria is divided into seven administrative regions called ' (singular '). For every Administrative region there is a state agency called """" (district government)."
"Districts ""(Bezirke)""."
Controllers.
"The prototypes used to design the controller's electrical systems used a so-called ""yoke and gimbal"" taken from a radio control system used to fly model airplanes. This simple design gave very nice control and was highly reliable. The actual controllers sold with the game were quite different and a great disappointment to the development teams. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to center the stick, caused many joysticks to have no ability to center. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not provide smooth control through the travel of the stick. This made controlling games awkward. The controllers did, however, include a pause button. This was a novelty at the time, but would become standard on almost all future game systems. Replacement joysticks were also released by other manufacturers."
"Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line Trak-Ball controller for the system, which was used for titles such as ""Centipede"" or ""Defender"". A paddle controller and an updated self-centering version of the original controller were also being worked on, but never made it to market."
"In the web-video-game review show, James Rolfe's ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"", Rolfe's character is shown as being very frustrated with trying to use the controllers and Pro-Line Trak Ball as neither of them work properly. Other instances of web game review shows disliking the controller are on shows such as Mark Bussler's ""Classic Game Room"", where the host is shown stating that the Atari 5200 controllers are the worst game console controllers of all time."
The controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris.
Inside differences between the 5200 and the 400/800.
"Although the Atari 5200's insides were very much like that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were enough so that games designed for one would not run directly on the other."
"One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a keyboard. However, there were several others:"
"Atari Corp.'s later XE Games System revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a keyboard which could be removed, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly."
Market failure.
"The Atari 5200 could not run software for the still-popular Atari 2600. An adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games, using the more reliable controllers from the 2600."
Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc. gave to the console; most of its attention went to the older Atari 2600. It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVision's head start and a video game market which was beginning to fade.
"At one point, Atari Inc. planned on developing a smaller, less expensive version of the Atari 5200 which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the ""Atari 5100"" (a.k.a. ""Atari 5200 Jr.""), only a few fully-working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled."
"On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units."
Technical design.
"""Note: These descriptions are very technical. They are meant to be understood by people with lots of computer experience."""
Cooling.
"Cooling is when an object gets cold, or lowers in temperature. This can happen by taking away heat, or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature. Fluids used to cool objects are called coolants."
Air cooling is making the temperature of an object lower using air. This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object. The process will work better if there is more surface area on the object or if the item's mass can be made smaller.
"Other ways to cool objects include using ice, dry ice, or liquid nitrogen. This works by convection; the heat is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant."
Electrical conductivity
"Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the ""siemens per meter"", (A2s3m−3kg−1) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm−1."
It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test.
"Electrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge (such as electrons), which can carry electricity. When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears."
"A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity, and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity. A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions."
Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal (or inverse) of electrical resistivity.
Pierre Omidyar
"Pierre Omidyar (born June 21, 1967) created and is now the chairman of eBay. He was born in Paris, France to a French-Iranian family. Born in Paris, France, brought up by Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the United States at the age of six. He grew up in Washington D.C. and developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated high school in 1984. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University. He helped write MacDraw in 1989 for Claris, a part of Apple Computer. Two years later he co-founded Ink Development (later renamed eShop). He was 28 when he wrote the original computer code for what eventually became e-Bay. The site was launched on Labor Day, Monday, September 4 1995, under the more basic name “Auction Web.”"
Caribert of Laon
"Caribert of Laon, son of Martin of Laon, was the grandfather of Charlemagne. He was the father of Charles's mother, Bertrada of Laon. In 721, he signed, with his mother Bertrada of Prüm, the foundation act of the Abbey of Prüm. The same year, also with his mother, he made a donation to the Abbey of Echternach. In 744, his daughter Bertrada of Laon (by Bertrada of Cologne) married Pepin the Short, mayor of the palace of Neustria and Burgundy and later king of the Franks. He died before 762."
First Lady of the United States
"The First Lady of the United States, abbreviated to as (FLOTUS) is the title and role held by hostess of the White House and usually the wife of the President of the United States, during the president's term in office."
"Jill Biden is the current First Lady of the United States, in role since January 2021 as the wife of President Joe Biden."
"Some famous and popular past former first ladies among the citizens of the United States are favorable due to their inspirational fashion style and initiatives through public service insist of women such as, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Dolley Madison, Mary Lincoln, Edith Wilson, Lou Hoover, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump."
Origins and Role.
"The first lady is not elected by the people of the United States. There are no official jobs she is officially required to perform and she is not paid for being the first lady, but she is often involved in political campaigns, managements of the White House, participating in social causes and representing the president at official and ceremonial occasions and accompanying the president on foreign summits and events."
Office of the First Lady of the United States.
"The Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the first lady for her to carry out her duties as the official hostess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The first lady has her own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, White House Social Secretary, and Chief Floral Designer. The Office of the First Lady is located in the East Wing of the White House."
List of living former first ladies.
"As of January 20, 2021, there are five living former First Ladies, as seen below."
Star Wars
"Star Wars is a American science-fiction media franchise created by George Lucas. As of December 2019, nine movies in the main series have been made by Lucasfilm Ltd, released by 20th Century Fox, and distributed by Disney."
"""Star Wars"" has been so popular that there have been ""Star Wars"" books, video games, television shows, toys, spinoff movies and more. It is also known for its iconic music by John Williams. With influences such as, ""Starcrash"", ""The Man Who Saved The World"", etc."
Military career.
"Eisenhower was born into a family which did not have much money. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet in 1911, and as an officer served in many different places including the Panama Canal Zone, Washington, D.C. and the Philippines. During World War II, he was a general. He directed the invasion of Morocco and Algeria during the North African Campaign. He became a 5-star general and was the Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord (an attack on Germany which was one of the most important battles of the war)."
"After World War II ended, he was considered a war hero. In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, the American public begged Eisenhower to run for president. Eisenhower (whose political views were unknown at the time) joined the Republican Party. He chose Richard Nixon as his vice-presidential candidate and won the election by beating Adlai Stevenson II."
"Presidency, 1953–61."
He served two terms from 1953 to 1961. Eisenhower was the first President of the United States to be president of all 50 states.
"During the beginning of his first term, he oversaw a ceasefire (which stopped the fighting) during the Korean War. He created NASA (the United States space program) which began a space race against the Soviet Union. Eisenhower believed that the United States should not try to fight wars overseas, but instead that United States should make more nuclear weapons so it could have an advantage in the Cold War. The United States was able to keep the Soviet Union in check without spending a lot of money. For this reason, the U.S. government had balanced budgets during his presidency and did not have to borrow money."
"He intimidated the Soviet Union by making them believe that the United States would respond to any act of aggression with the use of nuclear weapons. That policy is called brinkmanship, new look, and massive retaliation. He also authorized planes to spy on the Soviet Union, but when a U.S. spy plane accidentally crashed into the Soviet Union near the end of Eisenhower's term, it hurt relations between the United States and the Soviet Union."
"McCarthyism (when Senator Joseph McCarthy was accusing hundreds of people of being communist spies without evidence) was also an issue during his presidency. Eisenhower disliked Joseph McCarthy and tried to bring him down behind the scenes, but Eisenhower did not like to make enemies, so he did not talk about McCarthy much."
"Domestically (in the country), the economy was doing very well and the nation was prosperous. Eisenhower supervised the creation of the interstate highway system and created the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Eisenhower was a moderate conservative (near the center of the political spectrum). He wanted to continue some New Deal programs such as Social Security, but at the same time, he wanted the government to be limited. At first, many criticized him for not doing enough to give civil rights to African Americans, but later during his presidency, he signed two civil rights acts and sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to make sure schools were desegregated."
Legacy.
When Eisenhower's presidency ended he was not very popular with scholars. Over time his reputation slowly improved and historians now generally consider him to be a good president.
"In September 2020, a presidential memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C. honoring Eisenhower."
Factor
A factor can be:
Ball
Ball could mean:
Ferrocement
"Ferrocement is both a method and a material used in building or sculpting with cement, sand, water and wire or mesh material. It is often called the thin shell. Thin shell ferrocement offers strength and economy and can be used in many ways including: building homes, creating sculptures, or building boats and ships."
Camera lens
"A camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to the film or, in a digital camera, to a computer chip that can sense the light. Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass. The lens makes an image by focusing the light."
"The majority of cameras only have one lens that users cannot change or take out. This is called a ""fixed lens"" design. More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off, so anyone can take out one lens and put in another. A lens may be simple, or may actually be made of several lenses."
"Photographers can use different lenses (objectives) to make different kinds of pictures. For example, a telephoto lens can take a picture of something far away. A wide-angle lens is the opposite. A zoom lens is more versatile; it can do both. There are many kinds of lenses."
The study of lenses and how they work is called optics.
"Lenses for large sheet film cameras are especially difficult to design. Cameras and their lenses have been made since the 19th century. Some from before World War II, are still usable today. Computers now let engineers make better lenses, though, because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task. Together with lenses, filters, macro lenses, teleconverters, wide-angle and tele attachments are used."
Boy
"A boy is a young male human, either a child or teenager. Little boys still have the body of a child. It is not until they reach puberty (adolescence) that their bodies start to mature and they become a man."
The word “boy” was used a long time ago in Anglo-Saxon English. The opposite of a boy is a girl.
The humoral immune system is a part of the immune system which defends the body against invading organisms and other foreign material.
"The humeral part is done by macromolecules outside the cells. These may be secreted antibodies, complement proteins, or certain antimicrobial peptides. Their job is to attack bacteria (and other foreign substances) which are loose in the blood stream or other fluids. In older medicine, these fluids were called ""humors"". Both the more primitive innate immune system, and the later acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, have humoral components."
"The humoral immune system contrasts with the cell-mediated immunity. That involves the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen."
How the humoral system works.
"The main cells that make it work are the B cells, which create and secrete antibodies that seek out the invaders and attach to them. Once the invader is coated in antibodies, this targets the invader for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Before the B cell can create antibodies, it first needs T helper cells to 'teach' the B cell about details of the incoming invader. This is a key part of the adaptive immune system, and the reference attached here summarizes the process."
"The production of antibodies tailor-made to combat particular bacteria is the most important element, but there are a number of other humeral defenses from the more primitive innate immune system."
Andrew Shaw
"Andrew Shaw (born July 20, 1991 in Belleville, Ontario) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player that played for the Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL)."
He began his hockey career with the Niagara IceDogs of the OHL and played for them for 2 seasons. He also played for the Owen Sound Attack for 1 season. He entered the draft on 2011 and he was drafted with the 139th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.
"He was assigned to the Rockford IceHogs, the farm team of the Blackhawks. He was called up to the Blackhawks during the 2011-12 NHL season. On January 5, 2012, he got in his first-ever NHL fight on the second shift of his first NHL game. He returned to the game after receiving stitches and score the first goal of his NHL career on his first shot of his first game against Ilya Bryzgalov of the Philadelphia Flyers. On June 24, 2013, He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 2 in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals."
Allison Crowe
"Allison Crowe (November 16, 1981, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist. Most of the songs she records are written by Crowe. She is known as well for releasing cover versions of certain songs. She is known for releasing independent albums. Cover songs include the Beatles' ""Let it Be"" and ""Imagine"" from John Lennon. Her distinctive voice is often compared against that of Mahalia Jackson. She appeared in a cameo role in the 2013 movie ""Man of Steel""."
Moore's law
"Moore's law is that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years. Intel executive David House said the period was ""18 months"". He predicted that period for a doubling in chip performance: a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster."
"The law is named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper."
"The paper stated that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965 and predicted that the trend would continue ""for at least ten years"". His prediction has proved very accurate. The law is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development."
"The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras. All of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well."
This exponential improvement has greatly increased the effect of digital electronics in the world economy. Moore's law describes a driving force of technological and social change in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
"This trend has continued for more than half a century. Intel stated in 2015 that the pace of advancement has slowed. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, announced that ""our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two""."
Shahriar Nafees
Shahriar Nafees Ahmed () (born 25 January 1986) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He is a left-handed opening batsman. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Bangladesh in 2005. The opposition team was England. In 2005 he played his first Test.
Mushfiqur Rahim
"Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim () (born 1 September 1988) is a Bangladeshi cricketer and the captain of his national team. He made his Test debut in 2005, at the age of 16. Rahim trained at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports. At the next year he made his ODI debut. At the end of 2011 he was given the captain of his national side."
Habibul Bashar
"Qazi Habibul Bashar () (born August 17, 1972) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He was the former captain of Bangladesh national cricket team. He captained Bangladesh at 2007 ICC World Cup. The first test victory came under his captaincy against Zimbabwe. He is the most successful captain in Bangladesh cricket's history. Under his captaincy, Bangladesh have beaten Australia, India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in limited overs matches. He is currently one of the chief selectors of BCB"
Early career.
"Slug is a general term for a gastropod mollusc which has no shell, or just a small internal shell."
"Slugs belong to several different families which also include snails with shells. Snails are gastropods with a coiled shell large enough for the animal to pull back inside. The families of land slugs are not very closely related, despite looking similar. The shell-less slug type is an example of convergent evolution, and so the category ""slug"" is not a taxonomic category."
"The name ""slug"" is used for air-breathing land slugs, while the marine forms are usually known as sea slugs. Land gastropods with a shell that is too small to hide the body are sometimes called ""semislugs""."
Body parts and behaviour.
"Like land snails, most slugs have four 'feelers' or ""tentacles"" on their head. The upper two (the ""optical tentacles"") see light and have eyespots at the ends, while the lower two (the ""sensory tentacles"") are used for smelling. The tentacles are retractable, and can regrow if lost."
"On top of the slug, behind the head, is a body part called the ""mantle,"" and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right side) of the mantle is a breathing hole, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. Inside the mantle in some species is a very small, flat shell."
"The bottom of a snail is called a ""foot"". Like other snails, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscle contraction on the bottom of its foot. At the same time, it secretes a layer of mucus on which it travels, which helps prevent damage to the foot. Around the edge of the foot is the 'foot fringe'."
"Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in places with cold winters, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn."
Ruwer
Ruwer could mean:
Ruwer (municipality)
"Ruwer is a municipality (a convention community called ""Verbandsgemeinde"" Ruwer) on the River Ruwer. The administrative offices are in the town of Waldrach, and it should not be confused with the nearby town of Ruwer, which is for administrative purposes a part of the city of Trier."
Gunpowder
"Gunpowder (or gun powder) is a mix of chemical substances (75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal and 10% sulfur). It is used primarily in firearms, burns very quickly, and creates gases. Those gases use up more space than the gunpowder they come from, so they push outward. If the gunpowder is in a small space, the gases will push on the walls of the space, building up pressure. In a gun, the pressure pushes against a bullet, causing it to fly out at high speeds. If the pressure became too high, it could destroy the gun barrel."
"Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese. The first references of black powder, the original form of gunpowder, date to the 9th century. According to legend, Chinese alchemists were looking for a formula to create the elixir of life, or the mythical potion that causes whoever drinks it to become immortal, when they accidentally created gunpowder. Because the powder was highly flammable, or burned very easily, they decided to call it ""fire medicine"" (Simplified Chinese: 火药 / Traditional Chinese: 火藥). The Chinese soon weaponized the substance, or made weapons out of it. In later centuries they made many weapons using gunpowder, including rockets, bombs, flamethrowers, and land mines, before making cannons and guns. The oldest weapon that uses gunpowder dates back to a bronze handheld cannon made in northeastern China in 1288. The first mention in Europe was in the 13th century when Roger Bacon described the formula of black powder. Gunpowder was extremely valuable to the Chinese civilization, in fact so valuable that sometimes it was traded for gold."
Mayor
"A mayor is a person who is in charge of the administration of a city. Some mayors are elected by the people who live in that city. For other cities, a central government body may choose the mayor. Some large cities have a Lord Mayor."
In federal countries like Germany the mayor can also be head of the government of a city state. The Mayor of Hamburg runs the government just like the Minister President of Bavaria runs the Bavarian government. In some big cities such as Tokyo the Mayor is a Governor.
"In many countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the mayor is not in charge of the daily functions of a city or town. That job is done by a Town Clerk or Chief Executive, who is appointed to a full-time paid job. The mayor works part-time, usually without payment, and represents the city at events and civic functions."
Churning of the Ocean
"Churning of the Ocean is a mythical story of Hinduism and Hindu mythology. It is described in many Hindu scriptures, especially in the Mahabharata and the Puranas. The story tells about the churning of the ocean by the gods and the demons. From this churning of the ocean, several things came out of the ocean. Some of them were:"
The Hindu scriptures and the Hindu mythology tell that all the above things came out of the ocean for the good of human beings.
Martha Washington
"Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (June 2, 1731 – May 2, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first President of the United States. Although people only started using the term decades after her death, Martha Washington is considered to be the first First Lady of the United States."
Early life.
"She was born on June 2, 1731, at Chestnut Grove Plantation near Williamsburg, Virginia. Her parents were John Dandridge, an immigrant from England, and his wife Frances Jones. Her education consisted of the womanly arts such as needlework and playing musical instruments. Later in life, she would learn to manage a plantation."
Fraternities and sororities
"Fraternities and sororities are social groups for college students, though sometimes high schools have them too. They exist mostly in the United States and Europe. The words ""frater"" and ""soror"" are Latin for ""brother"" and ""sister"" and used to show closeness between members. They also denote whether the group is for men or women. Sororities are only for women. Fraternities are only for men. But there are some fraternities for women."
"Fraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools. Each fraternity or sorority is given two or three Greek letters to call themselves, for example, ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) or ΑΧΩ (Alpha Chi Omega). To tell the difference between groups at different schools, called chapters, each chapter is given another set of Greek letters. For example, a man in the Kappa Sigma fraternity who goes to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is part of the fraternity's EX (Epsilon Chi) chapter. Chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in."
Fraternities and sororities often participate in community service.
Joining.
"Fraternities and sororities are often exclusive, meaning people who want to join need to be invited to do so. This is done during a process called ""rushing"". During a rush, people who want to join a chapter will talk to current members. If the member think the person rushing is a good fit for the group, they will get an invitation, called a ""bid"", to join the chapter. If the person rushing accepts, they become a ""pledge""."
"The pledging period is a time when the pledge is not yet a full member, and may leave or be refused membership at any time. Sometimes, members of the chapter will put the pledge through trials. Sometimes they are tests on the history of the fraternity they are trying to join, wearing a badge with the fraternity's letters on it at all times, or performing public service. Sometimes the trials are cruel, dangerous or humiliating. If the trials are cruel, it is called ""hazing"". Hazing is illegal in 44 states."
"After the pledging period, the pledge becomes a full member of the chapter and fraternity or sorority."
Bernese mountain dog
The Bernese mountain dog is a breed of dog from Switzerland.
"These dogs are ""tricolour"", which means their coat of fur is made up of three colors: black, white, and tan. They are gentle, loyal, and good with children. Bernese Mountain Dogs are very large dogs, weighing from 70 to 120 pounds (32 to 54 kilograms) as adults. They were first used to pull carts and worked as all-around farm dogs."
Fire ecology
"Fire ecology is about the effects of fire on the ecosystems where it occurs. The results of fire are studied, and also what causes the fires."
"In many ecosystems, fire helps keep the habitat healthy. Examples of such habitats are the North American prairie and chaparral ecosystems, and the South African savanna. In these ecosystems, fire helps renew the habitat. In theses places, many plants and trees have adapted and need fire to grow well, or for their seeds to germinate and start ecological succession."
"If the fires are stopped, dry wood and dead plants accumulate. Bushes and trees that catch fire easily will start growing. When this area finally does catch fire, it will make the wildfire larger and more damaging, and be harder to control."
"In the United States, campaigns have made people believe that wildfires are always bad for nature. This comes from the old belief that ecosystems grow towards a stable system, and disturbances like fires stop that, and destroy the harmony of nature. But we have since learned that in some areas, fire is needed to make the system work properly; fire also helps biodiversity of many habitats. The plants and animals in these habitats have adapted to protect themselves from fire, and sometimes must have fire to survive."
"Still, fire can kill people or burn down buildings. Now, controlled burns are sometimes done to have fire where it is needed, but don't let it go where it can cause damage to people or their property."
Goldman Sachs
"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., or just Goldman Sachs is an investment banking and securities firm. They are involved with global investment banking, securities, investment management, and other financial services mainly with institutional clients. They are also known to be a primary dealer in the United States Treasury security market."
"2017-Four have Goldman Sachs USD 7.830.000.000 (""deutsch 7,83 Milliarden Dollar"")."
"Startups in which the company or its funds have invested is H2O.ai, , Amount, Striim, PLACE, Unqork, and Enterra."
The Province
The Province is a newspaper that serves the British Columbia province in Canada. The Province was founded in 1898. The paper was bought in 1923 by a Southam family. The newspaper runs daily and is the most read newspaper in the province of British Columbia with The Vancouver Sun coming in second place. The newspaper also had a radio station named CFCB and it relinquished its licence in February of 1940 after the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation told it to.
"""The Province"" and ""Vancouver Sun"" are both owned by Postmedia Network Inc."
Vancouver Sun
"The Vancouver Sun is a newspaper that serves the British Columbia province in Canada. The ""Vancouver Sun"" was founded in 1912. The newspaper runs daily and is the second most read newspaper in the province of British Columbia with The Province coming in first place. The newspaper has the largest newsroom in Vancouver although its staff of reporters has reduced in recent years. The Vancouver Sun is not a part of the Sun Media chain which has newspapers in Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton."
"Some preloaded drives are read-only, but most can be used as a normal flash drive."
Backup.
The large memory size of newer flash drives means that they are increasingly being used for short term backup of data.
"For example, one retail till system uses a Flash drive to record details of all of the sales for that day. The drive is used as a backup medium. At the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a database backup is saved to the drive. The drive is removed at night and taken offsite."
Comparison to other forms of data storage.
"USB flash drives have replaced a number of other storage technologies, because they are easier to use. The replaced media include:"
Parts.
This photograph shows both sides of the printed circuit board (PCB) inside a typical flash drive (circa 2004). The flash drive in this photograph is a 64 MB USB 2.0 device with its plastic case removed.
"One end of the device is fitted with a single type-A USB connector. Inside the plastic casing is a small, highly cost-engineered, printed circuit board. Mounted on this board is some simple power circuitry and a small number of surface-mounted integrated circuits (ICs). Typically, one of these ICs provides an interface to the USB port, another drives the onboard memory, and the other is the flash memory."
Good points and bad points.
Pros.
Most computers support USB.
Flash drives are quite . They are not damaged by scratches and dust. This makes them a good choice to move data from one place to another.
"Some flash drives can keep the data, even if they are put in water. Some data may even survive the washing machine, but this is not a designed feature, and people should not rely on it. Leaving the flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems."
"Channel Five's ""Gadget Show"" cooked a flash drive with propane; froze it with dry ice; submerged it in various acidic liquids; ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives then managed to recover all the data on the drive. All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed."
"Flash drives are available in large sizes. Currently at the start of 2020, the largest size publicly available is 2 terabytes. This will increase as the technology gets better."
"Flash drives use little power, compared to hard drives and have no moving parts. They are small and easy to carry."
"Most modern operating systems can use a flash drive, without the need to install special software. To most operating systems, the flash drive looks like a hard drive. The operating system can use any file system. Some computers can start from a flash drive."
Cons.
"Flash memory has a limited life. Data can only be written to and read from a device a few thousand times. People should keep this in mind when they use a flash drive to run application software or an operating system. To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as Linux in Live USB) or commonplace applications (such as Mozilla Firefox) designed to run from flash drives."
Flash drives are small and are easily lost or left behind. This can cause problems of data security.
Security issues.
"Flash drives can hold a large amount of information and they are used worldwide. Many users store information on them that is personal, or that should be protected. For this reason, more and more flash drives offer biometrics or encryption to control the access to this data. Users can install passwords on to their flash drives so that when a user tries to open it, the computer prompts the user, to enter a password before they can begin using the device. There are a number of free and open source programs which can be used to encrypt data including TrueCrypt, pgpdisk and FreeOTFE. These programs have proved useful in securing data on flash drives."
"Most USB flash drives are dumb devices that hold data. However, like other storage devices, they can carry computer viruses. Bootable flash drives, like other boot devices, can easily spread them. Some such devices also have a controller chip comparable to an embedded system. In other words, the drive is a fully functional computer, which can transmit data as it wants. There have been cases where controller chips were manipulated, and spread malware."
"Some drives with a controller chip encrypt the data, with a secure algorithm, such as AES. In many cases, it was easy to decrypt the data, even without knowing the decryption key, because the implementation was not done properly."
"Because of the issues above, and because the use of USB devices is difficult to monitor, many companies no longer allow USB devices."
Ostrich
"The ostrich (""Struthio camelus"") is a large flightless bird that lives in Africa. They are the largest living bird species, and have the biggest eggs of all living birds. Ostriches do not fly, but can run faster than any other bird."
"They are ratites, a useful grouping of medium to large flightless birds. Ostriches have the biggest eyes of all land animals."
Appearance.
"Ostriches have long legs and a long neck, but they have a small head. Male ostriches have black feathers and female ostriches have gray and brown feathers. Both males and females have white feathers on their wings and tails."
"Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time. Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern."
"A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock."
"An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock."
"Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park."
"Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century."
Tsunami.
"A Tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can inundate coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns. This is a danger for the whole mankind."
"Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety."
Earthquake-proofing.
"Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake."
"To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break."
Colour
"Colour (Commonwealth English) or color (American English) is a property of light as seen by people. In Commonwealth English, it is spelled “colour” (notice the U), while in American English it is “color” (no U)."
The most common colour names are:
"""Primary colours"" can be mixed to make other colours. Red, yellow, and blue are the three traditional primary colours. The primary colours for television screens and computer monitors are red, green and blue. Printers and paints use magenta, yellow, and cyan as their primary colours; they may also use black. Sometimes this set of colours is simply called red, yellow, and blue."
People who can not see colours or have a distorted sense of colour are called colour blind. Most colour blind people are male.
"Colours are sometimes added to food. Food colouring is used to colour food, but some foods have natural colourings, like beta carotene."
"When something has no colour, it is transparent. An example is air."
"The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science."
"A translucent material is not the same as a colourless material because it can still have a colour, like stained glass."
Scurvy
"Scurvy is a disease (sickness). It is caused by not eating enough vitamin C. But scurvy can be prevented. It has many symptoms. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs. Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out. They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucus membranes). A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see depression). They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt."
"Scurvy can be easily cured. Oranges and other fruits can restore normal vitamin levels. In the past, sailors more commonly got scurvy due to being unable to access these foods. Fresh fruit could not be kept for long. The main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. It is now uncommon."
Signs of scurvy.
"At first, a person with scurvy may:"
A bit later a person with scurvy may:
Treatment.
"When a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly. Babies start eating again after one or two days of help. The symptoms get better within seven days."
Food sources.
"Eating vitamin C prevents scurvy. How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women. The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council's advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day:"
Article Two allows Congress to set a national Election Day.
Clause 5: Qualifications for office.
"This clause simply means that to be President, a person must meet three requirements:"
"If a person does not meet all of these requirements, they cannot be President."
Changes.
Two later amendments changed these rules about who can be President and Vice President:
Clause 6: Vacancy and disability.
"This clause talks about the possibility that the Presidency might become ""vacant"". This might happen because:"
"If the Presidency becomes vacant, the Vice President becomes President. If the Vice President is ""also"" unable to be President, Congress can decide who will become President. Whoever takes over the Presidency will act as President until the actual President gets better (if he is sick or disabled), or until a President is elected in the next Presidential election."
"Congress has come up with a ""line of succession"" a list of the people who would become President, and in what order, if both the Presidency and Vice Presidency became vacant. As of 2016, the order is: the Speaker of the House of Representatives; the President ""pro tempore"" of the Senate; and then the fifteen Cabinet Secretaries, in order of when their Departments were first created."
Changes.
This clause was partially changed by the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. That Amendment creates a process for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. It also says that the Vice President can become Acting President (temporary President) if:
"If the President declares himself unable to discharge his duties, he can take the Presidency back at any time. For example, in 2002, George W. Bush became the first President to formally use the Disability Clause. He gave power to his Vice President for about two hours while he had a medical test which required anesthesia. Once he felt ready to be President again, Bush took back the Presidency."
"If the Vice President and the Cabinet say a President is unable to do his job, the President can still try to take control back. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet still think the President cannot do his job, they can challenge the President's return. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate agree, the President is declared unable to discharge his duties and the Vice President stays in control of the Presidency."
Clause 7: Salary.
"This means the President can receive a salary. However, the salary cannot be changed during the President's four-year term in office. Also, the President cannot receive any other salary, either from the federal government, or from any state government."
Clause 8: Oath or affirmation.
"Before he becomes President, Clause 8 requires the new President to take an oath, promising that he will do his best as President, and will also do his best to protect and defend the Constitution. Usually, the Chief Justice of the United States gives the oath (""swears in"" the new President) at the President's inauguration."
Section 2: Presidential powers.
Section 2 talks about the powers that Article Two grants to the President.
Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons.
The Constitution gives the President the most powers in areas that have to do with national security and protecting the country.
"The President is the military's Commander-in-Chief. However, as part of the system of checks and balances in the Constitution, Article One says that only Congress can declare war. Still, the President can take actions like sending soldiers to certain places without needing Congress's approval, or a declaration of war."
"The President may ask the ""principal (head) officer"" of any executive department to give him advice in writing. The Constitution actually does not require a formal Cabinet. However, America's first President, George Washington, organized his principal offices into a Cabinet, and every President has done the same since."
"The President may grant pardons or reprieves to people who were convicted of crimes (except when the person was impeached). A ""reprieve"" cancels or changes a punishment for example, changing a death sentence to a sentence of life in prison."
Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause.
"This part of Section 2 is called the ""Advice and Consent Clause"". It gives the President powers, but he has to use them with the ""advice and consent"" (agreement) of the Senate. This is another example of checks and balances in the Constitution."
Treaties.
"Here, the Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with other countries. However, two-thirds of the Senators must agree with the treaty for it to take effect. If two-thirds of the Senate does not agree with the treaty, it is not approved, and there is nothing the President can do about it."
"The Constitution does not say how the United States can ""end"" a treaty. Since the Constitution has passed, the government has done this in a few ways. In 1798, the first time the government wanted to end a treaty (the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France), Congress passed a law ending the treaty. Other times, in the 1800s, a few Presidents ended treaties after Congress asked them to. The first time a President ended a treaty without Congress's approval was in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter ended a treaty with the Republic of China. In a lawsuit called ""Goldwater v. Carter"", members of Congress asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a President could end a treaty on his own. The Supreme Court could not agree on a decision, and the case was dismissed (ended without a decision)."
Appointments.
"The President may also choose judges, ambassadors, consuls (diplomats), ministers, and other officers; but again, he needs the advice and consent of the Senate."

Pinocchio (2022 live-action movie)
"Pinnochio is a 2022 American musical fantasy film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz. The film, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is a live-action adaptation of Walt Disney's 1940 animated film of the same name, which is itself based on the 1883 Italian book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"", by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Keegan-Michael Key in voice roles."
"""Pinocchio"" was released on September 8, 2022, by Disney+. The film received mixed reviews from critics."
Plot.
"A hobo cricket named Jiminy Cricket enters the home of an elderly woodcarver named Geppetto, accompanied by his pet kitten Figaro and pet fish Cleo, and finds that he has completed work on a marionette puppet he names Pinocchio. When Geppetto decides to retire for the night, he makes a wish on a star. A few hours later, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by the Blue Fairy, who tells Pinocchio that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy and she also appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong. When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed."
"After a few days, Geppetto decides that Pinocchio should attend school and sends him there. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by a con-artist fox and cat named ""Honest"" John and Gideon as they convince him that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when they really want to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for wealth. Jiminy, who finds Pinocchio with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces Pinocchio to continue going to school. Unfortunately Pinocchio is thrown out of school on account of being a puppet, so he decides to go to Stromboli's after all and Jiminy can't stop him when John places a glass jar over him."
"At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees Vitelli and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd as they throw their cash to him, but Stromboli locks Pinocchio in a bird cage to prevent him from ever leaving, wanting to exploit Pinocchio for all he's worth. Soon, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the keys to the lock on the cage by telling lies since that makes his nose grow. Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner."
"Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismatic Coachman, who is taking the kids to Pleasure Island, an isle where misbehavior is encouraged. When they reach the island, Pinocchio slowly gets disturbed by the amount of cruelty the kids commit, much to the bemusement of an unruly boy named Lampwick. When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the kids their get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a pool hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail."
"Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Vitelli and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and rendering Geppetto unconscious."
"Pinocchio thinks Geppetto has died, and despairs before Geppetto comes to and soon tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home as Pinocchio slowly transforms into a real boy. Jiminy then breaks the fourth wall before ending the film."

Itanium 9300 (Tukwila): 2010.
"The Itanium 9300 series processor, code-named ""Tukwila"", was released on February 8, 2010, with greater performance and memory amount."
"Tukwila uses a 65 nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24 MB CPU cache, Hyper-Threading technology and new memory controllers. It also has double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor bandwidth of 96 GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using QPI interfaces to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the ""Nehalem"" architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets."
"Tukwila incorporates four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 DIMMs via a separate memory controller,"
"similar to the Nehalem Xeon processor code-named ""Beckton""."
Itanium 9500 (Poulson): 2012.
"The Itanium 9500 series processor, code-named ""Poulson"", is the follow-on processor to Tukwila and was released on November 8, 2012."
"Intel says it skips the 45 nm process technology and uses the 32 nm process technology instead; it features 8 cores, has a 12-wide issue architecture, multi-threading additions, and new instructions for parallelism, including virtualization."
"The Poulson L3 cache size is 32 MB. L2 cache size is 6 MB, 512 I KB, 256 D KB per core. Poulson's size is 544 mm², less than Tukwila's size (698.75 mm²)."
"At ISSCC 2011, Intel presented a paper called, ""A 32nm 3.1 Billion Transistor 12-Wide-Issue Itanium Processor for Mission Critical Servers."""
"Given Intel's history of sharing details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson. Analyst David Kanter speculates that Poulson will use a new architecture, with a more advanced form of multi-threading that uses as many as two threads, to improve performance for single threaded and multi-threaded work."
New information was released at Hot Chips conference.
"The new information claims improvements in multithreading, reliability improvements (Instruction Replay RAS) and some new instructions (thread priority, integer instruction, cache pre-fetching, data access hints)."
"In Intel's Product Change Notification (PCN) 111456–01, it listed 4 models of Itanium 9500 series CPU, which were removed in a revised version of the document. The parts were later listed in Intel's Material Declaration Data Sheets (MDDS) database. Intel later posted Itanium 9500 reference manual."
The models are:
Market share.
"In comparison with its Xeon server processors, Itanium has never been a large product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007."
"According to Gartner Inc., the total number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% in the second quarter of 2008."
"According to an IDC analyst, in 2007, HP had about 80% of Itanium system revenue."
"According to Gartner, in 2008, HP had 95% of Itanium sales. HP's Itanium system sales were at $4.4 Billion at the end of 2008, and $3.5 Billion by the end of 2009,"
"compared to a 35% decline in UNIX system revenue for Sun and an 11% drop for IBM, with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14% during this period."
"In December 2012, IDC released a research report stating that Itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016, with annual shipment of 26,000 systems (a decline of over 50% compared to shipments in 2008)."
Hardware support.
Systems.
", only a few providers have Itanium systems, such as HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. Intel offers a chassis that can be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems."
"HP, the only one of the industry's top 4 server manufacturers to sell Itanium systems today, creating at least 80% of all Itanium systems. HP sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006."
"Most Itanium systems sold are enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about US $200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors."
Chipsets.
"The Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express."
"Currently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi."
"The ""Tukwila"" Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to ""evaluated for future implementation opportunities""."

Hugo Black
"Hugo LaFayette Black (February 27, 1886 – September 25, 1971) was an American judge and politician. He was from Ashland, Alabama and studied law at the University of Alabama. Black was poor as a child and lived simply for most of his life. Black was in the Army during World War I. In the 1920s, Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Black was a member of the U.S. Senate from Alabama from 1927 to 1936 as a Democrat. Black was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt for President and his New Deal policies. In 1937, Roosevelt put Black on the United States Supreme Court. Black supported many New Deal organizations and programs which his fellow judges wanted to limit or strike down. Black often believed in interpreting the Constitution exactly as it was written (textualism), against ideas both that judges had the power to re-interpret the meaning in accordance with their time, or that it could be taken as a general guideline that lawmakers should follow but also consider other interests. One prominent example is the First Amendment, which Black believed to literally protect any form of ""freedom of speech"" against a law that would ""abridge"" (meaning to hinder) it, or at least laws prohibiting certain ""opinions"". He also believed that the Fourteenth Amendment meant this applied to states as well as the federal government, and that states subsequently could not limit free speech and other constitutional liberties anymore than the federal government. For many years most jurists and judges had believed this. He also did not believe in the substantive due process doctrine, meaning that the Fourteenth Amendment secured certain ""implicit"" rights regarding privacy and so on, which were not written into the constitution but had to be made by judges as they went along. Black believed that, while the Constitution promised generous liberties, judges should never decide for themselves on which these liberties should be. (Because of this he also did not believe in things such as natural law, which he called ""mysterious"".) This contradiction is uncommon among later judges. He did not believe in a right to privacy, which is not expressed in the constitution, and voted against one in the case ""Griswold v. Connecticut"". He did, famously, vote against segregation in ""Brown v. Board of Education"" (1954), an important case that began the desegregation of schools. Black was the fifth longest-serving justice in American history. He served on the Court for 35 years, one of the very longest tenures, and was the last of president Roosevelt's appointees except William O. Douglas (who served 36 years, the longest). Black died of a stroke in 1971, which happened two days after he chose to leave the Supreme Court. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery."
"One of the most famous judgments Black wrote is called ""Korematsu v. United States"" in 1944. In this case, the majority believed the imprisoning of civilian (non-military) Japanese Americans during World War II was just or at least acceptable, under the circumstances. This is one of the most controversial verdicts of the Supreme Court in its history and often seen as a stark contrast (meaning opposite) to what he stood for in most other cases."
Abhar
"Abhar is a city in northwestern Iran. In the year 2006 there were 55,266 people living there."
Colugo
Colugos are gliding mammals in the order Dermoptera.
"There are two living species, found in south-east Asia. They are also called 'flying lemurs', though they are not lemurs (all lemurs are in Madagascar). They can glide long distances, as they have a thin membrane stretched to the ends of the tail and each limb."
Life style.
"Colugos live in the tropical rain forests of southeast Asia. Their diet includes leaves and young shoots. During the day they rest high in the trees, clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes. At dusk they become active, gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind. The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane."
Habitat.
"Colugos range from Burma, Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. They also occur throughout Borneo. A second colugo species inhabits the southern Philippines."
Plural ignorance
"Plural ignorance or pluralistic ignorance is a term which gives a name to a situation where a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but at the same time, they assume incorrectly that most others accept it. The term describes a context in which ""no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes."""
A context of plural ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network.
A situation of plural ignorance develops when each individual decision-maker in a group of decision-makers does not have the necessary information to solve a problem.
History.
"The term ""pluralistic ignorance"" was coined by Daniel Katz and Floyd H. Allport in 1931."
"Plural ignorance may partially explain why people are more likely to intervene in an emergency situation when alone than when other persons are present. If people monitor the reactions of others in such a situation, they may conclude from the inaction of others that other people think that it is not necessary to act."
Millionaire Hot Seat
"Millionaire Hot Seat is an Australian television game show. It is a spin-off of the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". It first aired on 20 April 2009. It is hosted by Eddie McGuire."
Gameplay.
"Six players compete for a prize of $1,000,000. Players are asked multiple choice questions with four possible answers. Each question has a time limit. The time limit is 15 seconds for the first five questions, 30 seconds for the next five questions, and 45 seconds for the last five. Players have one ""pass"" that they can use. If a player uses a pass, the question goes to the next player in line. That player can not use their pass on the question. If a player answers a question incorrectly, they are removed from the game, go home with nothing, and the top prize is lowered. If a player does not give an answer in the time limit, it is considered a pass. If they can not pass, they are removed from the game."
"If the first player answers the first five questions correctly, they win a $1,000 bonus."
"The game ends when all of the players are removed from the game or the last question is answered. If the question is answered correctly, the player wins the amount of money the question is worth. If it is answered incorrectly, the player goes home with nothing. If the 5th question was answered correctly, they leave with $1,000."
Bathroom cabinet
"A bathroom cabinet (or medicine cabinet) is a cabinet in a bathroom. Most of the time it is located above bathroom sink. The main role of bathroom cabinet is to be place to keep drugs, hygienic equipment and toiletries like toothbrush and perfumes. Having a bathroom cabinet saves a space (it is located above sink which usually is unused space), helps to organize belongings in case of broken pipe or other kind of flooding in the bathroom."
Michel Aflaq
"Michel Aflaq (‎, , 9 January 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, sociologist and Arab nationalist. He is considered to be the principal founder of Ba'athism."
Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)
"The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party (also spelled Ba'th or Baath, ""resurrection"" or ""renaissance""; ""Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-'Arabi Al-Ishtiraki""), also called the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath movement, is a Ba'athist political party headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq. It is one of two parties which formed in 1966 after split of the original Ba'ath Party. They ruled Iraq between 1968 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq."
Ba'athism
"Ba’athism is an ideology which emerged in the Middle East in the twentieth century. It is a revolutionary ideology which stands for Arab nationalism, Pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism and socialism, though the ideology has taken different forms in different countries and periods. Ba’ath (Arabic: بعث) is an Arabic word which translates to ‘’resurrection’’ or ‘’revival’’. This term reflects what the groups and movements behind the ideology strive to accomplish, namely a rebirth of Arab culture, nationalism, values and society. The main thinker and founder of Ba’athism is Michel Aflaq. Due to Aflaq’s efforts Ba’athism has been established in the past in Syria and Iraq."
Origins.
"The emergence of Arab nationalism in the early twentieth century falls in line with the historical developments of the time as well as earlier ideological developments. Among the historical developments, is the Ottoman Empire’s neglect of the Arab region as well as their overusage of the region's agricultural resources during the period of World War I. After the Ottomans, there was the imperialist presence of the French and the British in former Ottoman regions like Syria and Iraq. The combination of being ruled by others as well as the rise of nationalist ideologies across the globe had given rise to Arab nationalism and eventually Ba’athism."
Beliefs.
"Since the first establishment of a Ba’athist party in Syria in the 1940s, there have been a number of different Ba'athist parties and figureheads. The most prominent examples are Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There are different forms of Ba'athism. However, the core principles can be reduced to the writings and ideas of Michel Aflaq. These principles are Arab nationalism, revolution, pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism and socialism."
"When Aflaq speaks of (Arab) nationalism in an essay, he describes it as unconditional and even unquestionable love for the Arab nationality. Part of the love for the Arab nationality is to be of “useful service” to the Arab nation. This idea of the Arab citizens’ individual responsibilities and services ties in with the socialist aspects of Ba'athism."
"These stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as a ""vital antislavery tool."" This change in the way people looked at ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in an essay by James Baldwin. This essay was titled ""Everybody’s Protest Novel."" In the essay, Baldwin called ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" a ""very bad novel"". He said it was not well-written."
"In the 1960s and '70s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements strongly criticized the book. They said that the character of Uncle Tom was a part of ""race betrayal"". They said that Tom made slaves look worse than slave owners. Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time."
"However, people such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have begun studying ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" again. He says that the book is a ""central document in American race relations and a significant (important) moral and political exploration of the character of those relations."""
Jamie McMurray
"James Christopher ""Jamie"" McMurray (born June 3, 1976) is an American racecar driver. McMurray drove full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series from 2003 until 2018. Since 2018, McMurray has been a Sports analyst for FOX Sports. McMurray won the 2010 Daytona 500 while driving for Chip Ganassi Racing."
Phil Wachsmann
"Phil Wachsmann (born August 5, 1944) is an African ""avant-garde"" jazz/jazz fusion violinist born in Kampala, Uganda, probably better known for having founded his own group Chamberpot. He has worked with many musicians in the free jazz idiom, including Tony Oxley, Fred van Hove, Barry Guy, Derek Bailey and Paul Rutherford, among many others. Wachsmann is especially known for playing within the electronica idiom."
National Autonomous University of Mexico
"The National Autonomous University of México (UNAM) a university in Mexico City. It is one of the biggest universities in Mexico and Latin America. UNAM was started on 22 September 1910 by Justo Sierra.UNAM's main campus in Mexico City, known as ""Ciudad Universitaria"" (University City), is a UNESCO World Heritage site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the 20th century. Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. In 2016, it had an acceptance rate of only 8%. UNAM generates a number of strong research publications and patents in diverse areas, such as robotics, computer science, mathematics, physics, human-computer interaction, history, philosophy, among others. All Mexican Nobel laureates are either alumni or faculty of UNAM."
1985 Santiago earthquake
"The 1985 Santiago earthquake was registered the Sunday March 3, 1985 at 22:47 UTC (19:47 local time). Its epicenter was on the coastline of the Valparaiso Region, Chile, near Algarrobo. It had a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale."

Health care
"Health care or healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illnesses through services offered by the health profession and its staff. Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments, medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security."
Primary care.
"A primary care doctor (PCD) or primary care physician (PCP) is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered."
Culture of health.
"In 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term ″Culture of Health″, which has become widespread. The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health. Holism is the idea that natural systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts."
"According to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts—the concept of ″culture″ and the concept of ″health″. This is their synthesis, which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science, that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man."
"In 1994, Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) — International social movement ""To Health via Culture""."

"Rodrigo (English: Ruderic, Roderic, Roderik, Roderich, or Roderick, ; died 711 or 712) was the Visigothic King of Hispania for a brief period between 710 and 712. He is famous in legend as ""the last king of the Goths."" In history he actually is an extremely obscure figure about whom little can be said with certainty but that he ruled part of Iberia with opponents ruling the rest and was defeated and killed by invading Muslims who soon conquered the entire peninsula. His widow Egilona is believed to have married Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, who was later assassinated."
"An endocrinologist can find out if a person has one of these diseases by doing tests. They can test a person's blood to find out if they have too much or too little of a hormone. An example of this is Type 1 diabetes. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not have enough of a hormone called insulin. Endocrinologists usually do not treat patients directly, but give advice to physicians about what how patients might be helped."
Endocrine disorders fall into three groups:
"Most medical applications concern the lack of balance between hormones, and sometimes the complete lack of a necessary hormone. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone."
Helping transgender people.
"Endocrinologists can advise on hormone treatment for transgender persons. A transgender person might want their body to look different so that they look more like their chosen gender. For example, a transgender woman might want less facial hair so that she looks less like a man to other people."

"The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the god of Pastafarianism. It is often seen as a parody religion and thus has become popular with people opposed to the idea that God or gods created the world. Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are sometimes called ""Pastafarians"". The multiverse theory has suggested that what began as a spoof has become potentially real in the infinite universes and their countless creatures with at least some matching the general description of the FSM. Bobby Henderson first described the Flying Spaghetti Monster in 2005 in a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education. Henderson wrote the letter to protest rules about teaching intelligent design in public schools. The Board of Education required teachers to teach intelligent design."

The Real Ghostbusters
"The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series based on the 1984 movie ""Ghostbusters"". The series ran from 1986 to 1991, and was produced by Camme Animation Studios, DiC Entertainment and Coca-Cola Telecommunications. ""The Real"" was added to the title over a dispute with Filmation and its Ghost Busters properties. The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore, Dr. Ray Stantz, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer."
Broadcast.
"The show originally aired on ABC for its full run, except for the third season which ran on syndication at the same time as the second season ran on ABC. Later, reruns of the show appeared on USA Network, Fox Family before moving to Nickelodeon from 1996 to 1999 and on Cartoon Network in 2002. Teletoon aired episodes of the series in the month of October beginning in 1998, but has not done so in recent years."
Spin-offs.
"""Slimer!""."
"At the start of the third season in 1988, with the series renaming, it was given an hour long time slot. In addition to the regular thirty-minute ""Real Ghostbusters"" episode, a half-hour ""Slimer"" sub-series was added that included 2-3 short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. At the end of its six season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of ""Slimer"", with multiple episodes airing out of production order. The segments added several characters as friends of Slimer, including the character Professor Norman Dweeb—mad scientist accompanied by a poodle named Elizabeth who wanted to capture Slimer to experiment on him. The Professor Dweeb also made infrequent appearances in the main series. One of the ghosts from the ""Slimer"" cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in ""The Real Ghostbusters"" to be captured a second time."
"""Extreme Ghostbusters""."
"In 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled ""Extreme Ghostbusters"", was created by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997 and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8, 1997. Set several years after the end of ""The Real Ghostbusters"", the series opened by saying the team has disbanded due to a lack of supernatural activity. Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system and teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon's students, returns to manage the office. The original Ghostbusters return for the series two-episode finale to celebrate Egon's 40th birthday, leading to them reluctantly working together with the younger generation to solve one last case."

New York City English
"New York City English (also called New York English) is a regional dialect of American English. It is spoken by many people in New York City and the New York metropolitan area. The dialect is known through its use in media. It is most often used in New York City itself and its nearby suburbs. However, it is used all across the metropolitan area."
"The dialect is known for dropping the ""r"" in some words. For example, the word ""cart"" in New York sounds similar to ""cot"" or ""caught"". Some New York area people say ""tawk"" for ""talk""."
"There are many well known people and fictional characters who speak New York English. They include Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, Fran Drescher and Marisa Tomei."
Geomagnetic reversal
A geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged.
"This has happened 183 times over the last 83 million years, averaging about two or three times per million years. Before a change of magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field becomes weaker and moves around, like a spinning top would before it falls. Scientists know this as a result of studies of magnetism on the sea floor, near the mid-Atlantic ridge. The lava slowly moves out of this crevasse (gap in the sea floor) and then it cools with its iron oxide molecules all pointing in the new direction of the Earth's magnetic field. We can look at the history of this magnetic field today to look back at the many flips in the past."
"Reversals occur at intervals from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. These periods are called ""chrons""."
"There is no pattern to these changes, which seem to take place at random. Chrons last from between 0.1 and 1million years (see diagram) with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to happen."
"The latest one, the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago; and may have happened very quickly, within a human lifetime. A brief complete reversal, known as the Laschamp event, occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5% of its present strength. Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions."
Records of the past.
"The past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe reversals on the ocean floor. This soon led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. The relatively constant rate at which the sea floor spreads causes ""stripes"" in the basalt. From these past magnetic fields polarity can be inferred. Data is got by towing a magnetometer along the sea floor."
"No existing unsubducted sea floor is more than about 180 million years old, so other methods are used for detecting older reversals. Most sedimentary rocks have tiny amounts of iron rich minerals. Their orientation reflects the magnetic field when they formed. The rocks keep that record unless they get changed by some later process."
Superchrons.
"A ""superchron"" is a polarity interval lasting at least 10million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the Cretaceous Normal and the Kiaman."
"The Cretaceous Normal (also called the Cretaceous Superchron or C34) lasted for almost 40million years. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly."
"The Kiaman Reverse Superchron lasted from the late Carboniferous to the late Permian. That is more than 50million years, from 312 to 262 million years ago (mya). The magnetic field had reversed polarity. The name ""Kiaman"" derives from the Australian village of Kiama, where some of the first geological evidence of the superchron was found in 1925."
Causes.
"The magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is caused by dynamo action of molten iron in the planetary core. This convection (movement) generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields. In simulations of planetary dynamos, reversals occur from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of UCLA ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself. Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in a laboratory liquid metal experiment VKS2."
Effects on life.
"As far as we know, there is no effect on life. Studies have been done to see if reversals relate in any way to extinction events. Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions."
Chron
"A chron is a general term in Earth science. It means a period of time, usually less than a million years."
Economic deficit
"Economic deficit is a status of financial health in which expenditures exceed revenue (more money being spent than coming in). The term ""budget deficit"" is most commonly used to refer to government spending rather than business or individual spending. When referring to accrued federal government deficits, the term ""national debt” is used."
"Service animals are animals that have been trained to do things to help people with disabilities. Service animals may also be called assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals, depending on the country and what the animal does."
Types.
There are three basic types of assistance animals:
"In the United States, as of the 2011 changes to Americans with Disabilities Act regulation only dogs may be used as service animals for the purposes of going to public places. However, in certain situations miniature horses are supposed to be accommodated the same as service animals that are dogs. The U.S. government does not recognize a right to use any other species as an assistance animal in public places where pets would not be permitted except on commercial aircraft."
Dogs.
"Dogs can be trained to do many different things to help owners with physical disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:"
"Dogs can also be trained to help owners with psychiatric (mental health) disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:"
"These are just examples of some of the things service dogs can do. Service dogs can also be trained to do many, many more things for people with all kinds of disabilities."
Miniature horses.
Miniature horses are horses that are usually less than three feet tall. They can be trained to:
"An owner might choose a miniature horse as a service animal because they are allergic to dogs, or because their religion says that dogs are unclean. Miniature horses can also live and work for about 30 years, much longer than a service dog."
Capuchin monkeys.
"Are not allowed in buildings with a ""no animal"" policy. They may be used at home or outside where any animal is allowed, but under the 2011 ADA revision, only canines and in some cases miniature horses, are legally recognized as public access service animals."
"Capuchin monkeys can be trained to do things with their hands, like:"
"Helper monkeys can be helpful to people who have trouble with using their hands and arms, like people with quadriplegia, very bad spinal cord injuries, very bad injuries to their hands and arms, and multiple sclerosis."
"Helper monkeys are usually raised in a human home as infants. Then they get years of training, usually in schools by private organizations. On average, they take 7 years to train. They are usually able to serve as helper monkeys for 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a service dog)."
"Not everyone agrees that monkeys should be service animals. Debbie Leahy, manager of captive wildlife protection for the Humane Society of the United States, says that monkeys are not real service animals and that sometimes they are abused during their training."
"In the United States, helper monkeys are also not counted as service animals under most laws."
Animals which cannot be service animals.
"If an animal has not been trained to do a job or task that will help a person with a disability, it cannot be a service animal."
"Some people with mental health problems, like anxiety or PTSD, use different kinds of animals to give them comfort (make them feel better) when they are upset. These animals are called ""comfort animals"" (or ""Emotional Support Animals"")."
"Some people use unusual comfort animals, like snakes, tarantulas, guinea pigs, turtles, and rats. Even if having the animal makes the owner feel better, these animals cannot be service animals because it is impossible to train them to do something to help a person with a disability."
"Even if a comfort animal is a dog or a miniature horse, being a comfort animal is not the same as being a service animal. Comfort animals make their owners feel better just by being there. A service animal is trained to recognize that there is a problem and do the job they were trained to do to help their owner. For example, a psychiatric service dog would recognize that its owner is feeling upset and do a specific job, like get medicine, get help, or distract the person, to help them."
Laws in the United States.
"In the United States, service animals have some protection under the law. Different laws set rules about service animals in different situations. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service animals in public places. Other laws, for example, control which service animals are allowed in housing. But these different laws do not agree on what counts as a service animal."
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
"In 1990, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its goal was to protect the rights of people with disabilities. At first, it mentioned only guide dogs as service animals. Since then, it has been changed to include more protections. It now defines a service animal as any ""dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities."""
"This means that only dogs count as service animals under the ADA. However, there is a special section in the new ADA about miniature horses. This section says that places covered by the ADA (like businesses) should allow miniature horses ""where reasonable."" To decide whether allowing a miniature horse into a place is ""reasonable,"" those places are allowed to use four questions:"
"If the answer to all four questions is ""yes,"" the place needs to let the miniature horse in, and treat it like a service animal."
"Other than service dogs and service miniature horses, no other type of assistance animal is protected under the ADA."
Protections for service animals.
"Under the ADA, it is illegal to refuse to let a service animal or its owner into:"
"Léon Walras (16 December 1834-5 January 1910) was a French economist. He started what is known as Lausanne school, or Marginalism today. He looked at market equlibrium. He started general equilibrium theory. For this, he looked at marginal utility: This is the added benefit of consuming another unit of an economic good. His thoughts are very important for Neoclassical econmics. In general equilibrium theory, he looked at a scenario, where there are (an unspecified, large) number of households and companies, who act on several markets: He postulated that what is true in one market, in equilibrium must be true for all of them: There is a system of price determination that has the property that supply and demand match on all markets. Abraham Wald could prove this hhypothesis only much later. Today, it is part of the Arrow–Debreu model."
Hawaiian Kingdom
"The Hawaiian Kingdom, or Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, was a sovereign state located in the Hawaiian Islands."
Establishment.
"The country was formed in 1795, when the warrior chief Kamehameha the Great, of the independent island of Hawaiʻi, conquered the independent islands of Oʻahu, Maui, Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi and unified them under one government. In 1810, the whole Hawaiian archipelago became unified when Kauaʻi and Niʻihau joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the House of Kamehameha and the House of Kalākaua."
Recognition.
"Major European powers recognised the country. The United States became its chief trading partner and watched over it to prevent some other power (such as Britain or Japan) from threatening to seize control. Hawaiʻi was forced to adopt a new constitution in 1887. King Kalākaua signed it, because the Honolulu Rifles, an anti-monarchist militia, thratened him. Queen Liliʻuokalani, who succeeded Kalākaua in 1891, tried to replace the 1887 constitution with a new one. She was but was overthrown in 1893, largely at the hands of the Committee of Safety, a group of residents consisting of Hawaiian subjects and foreign nationals of American, British and German descent, many of whom had been educated in the US, had lived there for a time. Hawaiʻi was an independent republic until the U.S. annexed it through the Newlands Resolution, on July 4, 1898. This created the Territory of Hawaii. United States Public Law 103-150 adopted in 1993 (informally known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that ""the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States"" and also ""that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum."""

Religious experience
"Sometimes people make experiences which they see in the context of a belief system. They call these experiences religious experiences, spiritual experiences, sacred experiences, or mystical experiences. William James made the concept popular, in the 19th century. He did this to fight the growing rationalism of Western society."
"In many religions, such experieces are called revelations. This also applies to the knowledge that comes from them. These religions say that a god or gods caused these revelations, and that they are not a result of a natural cause. They are considered real encounters with God or gods, or real contact with higher-order realities of which humans are not ordinarily aware."
"Skeptics say that these religious experiences are a normal feature of the human brain. As such, they can be studied in the same way other features of the brain are studied. To better be able to study them, scholars have classified such experiences in different ways."
Definitions.
"Psychologist and philosopher William James described four characteristics of mystical experience in ""The Varieties of Religious Experience."" According to James, such an experience is:"
History.
Origins.
"The notion of ""religious experience"" can be traced back to William James. He used the term ""religious experience"" in his book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"". It is considered to be the classic work in the field. At professional conferences, people often cite this book. James makes a difference between institutional religion and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization, and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has mystical experience, can be experienced regardless of the culture."
"The term has been used before James, though. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures said that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. Many of these views had a lot of influence. Kant said that moral experience justified religious beliefs. John Wesley also thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were a basis to religious commitment as a way of life."
Criticism.
"Sparassodonts shared the ecological niches for large predators with fearsome flightless ""terror birds"" (phorusrhacids), whose closest extant (living) relatives are the seriemas. Terrestrial ziphodont crocodilians were also present at least through the middle Miocene. Some of South America's aquatic crocodilians reached monstrous sizes, with lengths up to 12 m."
"Through the skies over late Miocene South America (6 Ma ago) soared the largest flying bird known, the teratorn ""Argentavis"", with a wingspan of 6 m or more, which may have lived in part on the leftovers of ""Thylacosmilus"" kills."
Later herbivores.
Xenarthrans are a curious group of mammals that developed morphological adaptations for specialized diets very early in their history.
"In addition to those extant today (armadillos, anteaters and tree sloths), a great diversity of larger types were present, including pampatheres, the ankylosaur-like glyptodonts, various ground sloths, some of which reached the size of elephants (e.g. ""Megatherium""), and even semiaquatic sloths."
"The notoungulates and litopterns had many strange forms, some examples of convergent evolution."
"Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene, possibly from condylarth stock, diversified, dwindled before the great interchange, and went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier, well before the interchange."
The North American fauna was typical northern eutheria (supplemented with Afrotherian proboscids).
Invasions.
"Once the continents were joined, invasions from the north to the south were numerous and significant in their effect. Invasions from south to north were much less significant. This is most clearly seen in the mammals."
Reasons.
"Reasons for this have been suggested. Wetland tropical species going north encountered desert or, at any rate, dry conditions in Mexico, where the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, also known as the Sierra Nevada (Mexico) or the Snowy Mountain Range, extends 900  km from west to east across central-southern Mexico."
"However, by far the most common theory is that North American fauna were 'topped up' from time to time whenever Eurasian species could get over the Bering Strait."
Mammals a special case.
"This applies with force to mammals, because the eutherian mammals originated in Asia and had undergone a great deal of evolution before they got to South America. Marsupials originally in Eurasia had long before been out-competed and gone extinct. It is not surprising the eutherians did well in South America."
"Marsupials in both South America and Australasia were weak in predators. The borhyaenids and ""Thylacosmilus"" (the 'marsupial' sabretooth) were not marsupials; they were the related group, the sparassodonts. Instead, in South America, the terror birds (""Phorusrhacos"" were for a long time the top predators."
"All these native forms were wiped out as short-faced bears, wolves, nine species of small cats, cougars, jaguars, lions, sabretooths (""Smilodon"" and ""Homotherium"") established themselves."
"The successes in the opposite direction are interesting. Opossums, as the Virginia Opossum, are well established over a wide range. They are the only surviving marsupial in North America, though there were others before mankind arrived in the Americas."
"The top native South American mammal success for a long time was the superorder Xenarthra, which had two different groups with large representatives in North America. One group was the giant ground sloths, such as the megalonychid ""Megalonyx"". This group lived in North America for over 10 million years, well before the Great Interchange. How they got there is not known. They got as far north as Alaska and the Yukon."
"The other group was the glyptodonts, such such as ""Glyptotherium texanum"". They were large, heavily armoured relatives of the armadillo."
"The ability of South America's xenarthrans to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case. The explanation for their success lies in part in their defence against predation. This was based on body armour and/or formidable claws. The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet-footed or quick-witted to survive. Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low metabolic rate (the lowest among the therians). Their low metabolic rate in turn allowed them to subsist on less abundant and/or less nutritious food sources. Unfortunately, the defensive adaptations of the large xenarthrans would have been useless against humans armed with spears and other projectiles."
Eomaia
Eomaia ('dawn mother') is an early fossil eutherian mammal. It is exceptionally well-preserved for a 125 million-year-old specimen.
"It was discovered in rocks of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning Province, China. These strata date to the Lower Cretaceous about 125 million years ago (mya)."
"The fossil is in length and virtually complete. It weighed between . Although the fossil's skull is squashed flat, its teeth, tiny foot bones, cartilages and even its fur are visible."
"""Eomaia"" is a eutherian. The eutherians are the placental mammals plus some extinct mammals which had not developed a placenta."
"What distinguishes the Eutheria from metatherians, a group that includes modern marsupials, are various features of the feet, jaws and teeth."
"However ""Eomaia"" is not a true placental mammal as it lacks some features that are specific to placentals."
"""Eomaia"" has:"
"Its discoverers sampled 268 characters from all major Mesozoic mammal clades and principal eutherian families of the Cretaceous period. As a result, they claimed ""Eomaia"" is at the root of the eutherian ""family tree"" with a few other fossils."
"The ""Eomaia"" fossil shows clear traces of hair. However this is not the earliest clear evidence of hair in the mammalian lineage, as fossils of the docodont ""Castorocauda"", discovered in rocks dated to about 164 mya, also have traces of fur."
Madison (name)
Madison is a family name of English origin. It has become a popular first name in the United States. It was one of the most popular names during the 2000s–2010s for girls.
"Although less common, the name has also been used for boys."
Tarantula nebula
"The Tarantula nebula (also known as 30 Doradus) is an H II region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It was originally thought to be a star, but in 1751 Lacaille recognized it was a nebula."
"The Tarantula nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8. Considering its distance of 49 kpc (160,000 light-years), this is an extremely luminous object. Its luminosity is so great that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, the Tarantula nebula would cast shadows."
It is the most active starburst region known in the Local Group of galaxies. It is also one of the largest such regions in the Local Group with an estimated diameter of 200 pc.
"30 Doradus has at its centre the star cluster NGC 2070 which includes the group of stars known as R136. This group puts out most of the energy that makes the nebula visible. The estimated mass of the cluster is 450,000 solar masses. It may become a globular cluster in the future."
"In addition to NGC 2070, the Tarantula nebula has other star clusters, including the much older Hodge 301. The most massive stars of Hodge 301 have already exploded in supernovae. The closest supernova observed since the invention of the telescope, Supernova 1987A, occurred in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula. The remnants of many other supernovae are difficult to detect in the complex nebulosity."
Rice allergy
"Rice allergy is a type of food allergy. People allergic to rice react to some rice proteins after they eat rice or breathe in rice steam. Although some reactions might lead to severe health problems, doctors can diagnose rice allergy with many methods and help allergic people to avoid reactions."
Symptoms.
"Some rice proteins are regarded as the causes of allergy in some people. People allergic to rice might have sneezing, runny nose, itching, asthma, stomachache or eczema after they eat rice. Besides eating rice, people with a rice allergy can have reactions breathing rice steam from cooked rice. Allergic people might have skin rashes and swellings. Moreover, they might stop breathing and die due to cardiac arrest."
Manuel Ezequiel Bruzual
"Manuel Ezequiel Bruzual (Santa Marta, Colombia, 1830 – Curaçao, 15 August 1868), was a military leader committed to liberal ideas, also in charge of the War and Navy Ministry in 1864, and in 1868 was designated provisional President of Venezuela."
Bank of the City of Buenos Aires
"The Bank of the City of Buenos Aires (""Banco Ciudad de Buenos Aires""), doing business as Banco Ciudad, is a publicly owned, municipal commercial bank in Buenos Aires, Argentina."
Banco Credicoop
"Banco Credicoop (""Creditco-op Bank"") is an Argentine cooperative bank. After the 2001 crisis in Argentina, it became the second private bank in the country behind Banco Macro Bansud and the first with completely national public capital. It is the most important cooperative bank in Latin America."
Origin.
"Banco Credicoop has its origin in the Credit Unions. In 1976 the Argentinean military government tried to eliminate credit unions, an area of ​​the cooperative sector. This prompted a defensive action that led to the merger of credit cooperatives in order to survive, giving rise to Banco Credicoop in 1979, from the merger of the 44 credit unions that existed in the Capital and in Greater Buenos Aires. Aires, some of which had been created in the early 20th century."
Activities.
"Towards the mid-1940s, with the election of Juan Domingo Perón, the Credit Unions began to reflect the industrial development that took place in the country, originating an accelerated growth and diversification of the sectors served."
"Starting in 1958, the creation of the Cooperative Funds Mobilization Institute (IMFC) as a second-tier cooperative caused a real explosion in the number and geographical dispersion of the entities. From that moment, the cooperative credit unions developed a new type of operation based on capturing resources through sight accounts, compensated by a national clearinghouse of payment orders."
"This allowed them to dispose of between 9% and 11% of the total deposits in the financial system, which the savings banks channeled to finance small and medium-sized companies, cooperatives and individuals. The development of cooperativism in a sector as sensitive as the financial one provoked the early opposition of national and foreign banks, as well as sectors of the big bourgeoisie, which generated a series of regulations and restrictive actions on the part of the Argentine State that reached their culminating point from the coup d'état of 1966."
"The civic-military dictatorship that governed Argentina between June 1966 and March 1973 –which intended to reorganize Argentine society– attacked credit cooperatives in their double character: as a financial company oriented to the development of small and medium-sized national companies, wage earners and entities of the social economy, a sector that had no place in the economic plans of the self-proclaimed “Argentine Revolution”; and as a social movement that had to freeze its activity –along with all the other social and political institutions of the country– during the stage of “economic time” imposed by the dictatorship. In short, of the 974 credit unions that operated in 1966, only 417 were able to survive the dictatorship. Their share of total deposits in the financial system had fallen from more than 10% to just under 2%."

Electrical circuit
"A circuit is a closed path that consists of circuit components in which electrons from a voltage or current source can flow. If the circuit consists of electric components like a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor etc. then it will be called an Electrical circuit and if the circuit consists of any of the electronic circuit components like a diode, a Transistor etc. then it will be called an Electronic circuit. So, the electronic circuits may consist both of the electrical and electronic circuit components, but an electrical circuit will have only the electrical components."
"The point where electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the ""source"" of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the ""return"" or ""earth ground"". The exit point is called the ""return"" because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit."
"The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's ""load"". The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power home appliances like refrigerators, televisions, or lamps or more complicated, such as the load on the output of a hydroelectric power generating station."
Circuits use two forms of electrical power: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by power stations. DC powers battery-operated vehicles and other machines and electronics. Converters can change AC to DC and vice versa. High-voltage direct current transmission uses big converters.
Electronic circuit.
"Electronic circuits usually use direct current sources. The load of an electronic circuit may be as simple as a few resistors, capacitors, and a lamp, all connected together to create the flash in a camera. Or an electronic circuit can be complicated, connecting thousands of resistors, capacitors, and transistors. It may be an integrated circuit such as the microprocessor in a computer."
Resistors and other circuit elements can be connected in series or in parallel. Resistance in series circuits is the sum of the resistance.
Circuit and wiring diagram.
"A circuit or wiring diagram is a visual display of an electrical circuit. Electrical and electronic circuits can be complicated. Making a drawing of the connections to all the component parts in the circuit's load makes it easier to understand how circuit components are connected. Drawings for electronic circuits are called ""circuit diagrams"". Drawings for electrical circuits are called ""wiring diagrams"". Like other diagrams, these diagrams are usually drawn by draftsmen, and then printed. Diagrams may also be created digitally using specialised software."
"A schematic is a diagram of an electrical circuit. Schematics are graphical representations of the essential connections in a circuit, but they are not lifelike depictions of a circuit. Schematics use symbols to represent components in the circuit. Conventions are used in a schematic to represent the way electricity flows. The common convention we use is from the positive to the negative terminal. The realistic way electricity flows is from the negative to the positive terminal."
"Circuit diagrams use special symbols. The symbols on the drawings show how components like resistors, capacitors, insulators, motors, outlet boxes, lights, switches, and other electrical and electronic components are connected together. The diagrams are a big help when workers try to find out why a circuit does not work correctly."
Circuit breakers.
"The current flowing in an electrical or electronic circuit can suddenly increase when a component part fails. This can cause serious damage to other components in the circuit, or create a fire hazard. To protect against this, a fuse or a device called a ""circuit breaker"" can be wired into a circuit. The circuit breaker will open, or ""break"", the circuit when the current in that circuit becomes too high, or the fuse will ""blow"". This gives protection."
Ground-fault-interrupt (G.F.I.) devices.
"The standard return for electrical and electronic circuits is the earth ground. When an electrical or electronic device fails, it may open the return circuit to the earth ground. The user of the device could become a part of the device's electrical circuit by providing a return path for the electrons through the user's body instead of the circuit's earth ground. When our body becomes part of an electrical circuit, the user can be seriously shocked, or even killed by electrocution."
"To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution, ground fault interrupts devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices. When an open circuit to earth ground is detected, the G.F.I. device immediately opens the voltage source to the device. G.F.I. devices are similar to circuit breakers but are designed to protect humans rather than circuit components."
Short circuits.
Short circuits are circuits that get back to the power source unused or with the same power as put out. Using these usually blow a fuse but sometimes they don't. Doing this with a battery can cause electrical fires.
"However, with steric hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer."
"Grignard reactions will not work if water is present; water causes the reagent to rapidly decompose. So, most Grignard reactions occur in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF), because the oxygen in these solvents stabilizes the magnesium reagent. The reagent may also react with oxygen present in the atmosphere. This will insert an oxygen atom between the carbon base and the magnesium halide group. Usually, this side-reaction may be limited by the volatile solvent vapors displacing air above the reaction mixture. However, chemists may perform the reactions in nitrogen or argon atmospheres. In small scale reactions, the solvent vapors do not have enough space to protect the magnesium from oxygen."
Making a Grignard reagent.
"Grignard reagents are formed by the action of an alkyl or aryl halide on magnesium metal. The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Typical solvents are diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Oxygen and protic solvents such as water or alcohols are not compatible with Grignard reagents. The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer."
"Grignard reactions often start slowly. First, there is an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. Alkyl and aryl bromides and iodides are common substrates. Chlorides are also used, but fluorides are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium."
"Many Grignard reagents, such as methylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium bromide, and allylmagnesium bromide are available commercially in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether solutions."
"Using the Schlenk equilibrium, Grignard reagents form varying amounts of diorganomagnesium compounds (R = organic group, X = halide):"
Initiation.
Many methods have been developed to initiate Grignard reactions that are slow to start. These methods weaken the layer of MgO that covers the magnesium. They expose the magnesium to the organic halide to start the reaction that makes the Grignard reagent.
"Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces ""in situ"", rapid stirring, or using ultrasound (sonication) of the suspension. Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are commonly employed activating agents. Chemists use 1,2-dibromoethane because its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Also, the side-products are innocuous:"
The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant.
"The addition of a small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal, allowing it to react."
Industrial production.
"Grignard reagents are produced in industry for use in place, or for sale. As with at bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation. A portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic; this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant."
Reactions of Grignard reagents.
Reactions with carbonyl compounds.
Grignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives.
"The most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, as in this example:"
Note that the acetal function (a masked carbonyl) does not react.
"Such reactions usually involve a water-based (aqueous) acidic workup, though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes. In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will form."
Reactions with other electrophiles.
"In addition, Grignard reagents will react with electrophiles."
"Another example is making salicylaldehyde (not shown above). First, bromoethane reacts with Mg in ether. Second, phenol in THF converts the phenol into Ar-OMgBr. Third, benzene is added in the presence of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine. Fourth, the mixture is distilled to remove the solvents. Next, 10% HCl is added. Salicylaldehyde will be the major product as long as everything is very dry and under inert conditions. The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane."
"Formation of bonds to B, Si, P, Sn."
The Grignard reagent is very useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds.
Carbon–carbon coupling reactions.
"A Grignard reagent can also be involved in coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl ""p""-chlorobenzoate to give ""p""-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III), often symbolized as Fe(acac)3, after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac)3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide."
"For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li2CuCl4), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to [substituted] styrenes."
Oxidation.
The oxidation of a Grignard reagent with oxygen takes place through a radical intermediate to a magnesium hydroperoxide. Hydrolysis of this complex yields hydroperoxides and reduction with an additional equivalent of Grignard reagent gives an alcohol.
formula_1
"A reaction of Grignards with oxygen in presence of an alkene makes an ethylene extended alcohol. These are useful in synthesizing larger compounds. This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignard reagents. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction, showing that the presence of oxygen is essential. The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard reagent in the reaction. This can addressed by using a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard reagent such as n-butylmagnesium bromide."
Religious denomination
"A religious denomination (also simply denomination) is a subgroup within a religion that has a common name, tradition, and identity."
"The term is often used for several Christian denominations including Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and the many sorts of Protestantism like Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian and Pentecostal."
"It is also used for the four branches of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist), and for the main branches of Islam (Sunnism and Shi'ism, Quranism, Ibadism, Sufism, Muwahhidism)."
"In Hinduism the major deity or philosophical belief functions as the identifier of a denomination and typically each has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Smartism, and Halumatha."
Christian denomination
"The word denomination is used for a large group of Christian people right across the world who use the same name, the same sort of organisation and have the same (or very similar) beliefs. Christianity is divided into ten main groups. These groups all branched out at different dates from the early Christianity founded by the followers of Jesus. The splits generally happened because they could not agree on certain beliefs or practices. The groups then divided into smaller groups. Each group that has its own separate name is a ""denomination"". The word ""denomination"" means ""Being given a name”"
Denominations.
Worldwide Christianity is divided into 10 major groups :
Each of these ten has important subdivisions. There are also other (smaller) groups that are not mentioned here.
"The Evangelical and Nontrinitarian branches of Christianity are much more divided up than any of the others. Each separate Evangelical church is often called a ""denomination"". While the Roman Catholic Church looks to a single earthly leader, the Pope, and has similar beliefs right across the world, the several Protestant denominations do not look to a single leader and sometimes have beliefs that are very different from each other."
"Many Christian denomination see themselves as part of the worldwide Church which includes other denominations as well. Some denominations, such as the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches and some Protestant Churches, believe that they are the ""only"" true Christian church."
"Some denominations have beliefs which almost all the other denominations would disagree with, very strongly. These beliefs are called ""heresy"" by the other churches."
"There were some movements considered heresies by the early church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the Gnostics (who had believed in an esoteric dualism), the Ebionites (who venerated Christ's blood relatives), and the Arians. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and various denominations formed during and after the Protestant Reformation. There also exists in Protestantism and Orthodoxy various degrees of unity and division."
"Comparisons between denominations must be approached with caution. For example, some churches are part of a larger church organization or diocese, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition."
"Numerical comparisons are also problematic. Some groups count membership based on adult believers and baptized children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through propaganda or outright deception."
List of Christian denominations by number of members
"This article gives information about the relative size of denominations, based mainly on claims by the churches themselves."
Christianity – 2.51 billion.
Catholicism – 1.329 billion.
"Catholicism is the largest branch of Christianity with 1.329 billion and the Catholic Church is the largest among churches. Figures below are in accordance with the ""Annuario Pontificio"", at 2018. The total figure does not include independent Catholic denominations (18 million)."
Independent Catholicism – 18 million.
"Various denominations self-identifying as Catholic, despite not being affiliated with the Catholic Church."
Protestantism – 900 million.
"Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians by number of followers. Estimates vary from 800 million to a billion, or nearly 40% of all Christians. The main reason for this wide range is the lack of a common agreement among scholars as to which denominations constitute Protestantism. For instance, most sources but not all include Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists and Independent Nondenominational Christianity as part of Protestantism. Moreover, Protestant denominations altogether do not form a single structure comparable to the Catholic Church, or to a lesser extent the Eastern Orthodox Communion. However, several different comparable communions exist within Protestantism, such as the Anglican Communion, World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Baptist Alliance, World Methodist Council and the World Lutheran Federation. Regardless, 900 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that this 900 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as Anabaptists, Baptists and multiple other groups that might sometimes disavow a common ""Protestant"" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, ""Christian""."
Historical Protestantism – 300–400 million.
The number of individuals who are members of historical Protestant Churches totals to 300-400 million.
Anglicanism – 110 million.
"There are about 110 million Christians in Anglican tradition, mostly part of the Anglican Communion, the third largest Christian denomination in the world."
Baptist churches – 75–105 million.
Future.
"The barrier was originally designed to protect London against a big flood level. The defence level included long-term changes in sea and land levels as understood at that time (~1970). Despite global warming, and a higher predicted rate of sea level rise, recent analysis suggested the barrier could last until around 2060–2070."
"Released in 2005, a study by four respected academics contained a proposal to replace the Thames Barrier with a more ambitious 16 km (10 mi) long barrier across the Thames Estuary from Sheerness in Kent to Southend in Essex."
Environmental chemistry
"Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric, aquatic and soil chemistry, as well as uses analytical chemistry. It is related to environmental and other areas of science. It is different from green chemistry, which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source."
"Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works. It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally. It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals. Then, it accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals."
"Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations, solutions, units, sampling, and analytical techniques. Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones."
Contamination.
"A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there. This may be due to human activity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with ""pollutant"", which is a substance that hurts the surrounding environment. While a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date."
"The ""medium"" (for example, soil) or organism (for example, fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a ""receptor"". A ""sink"" is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant."
Environmental indicators.
"Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, nutrients nitrates and phosphorus, heavy metals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), and pesticides."
Applications.
"Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), the Environmental Protection Agency (in the United States) the Association of Public Analysts, and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:"
Methods.
"Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies."
"Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools."
"Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms."
Published analytical methods.
Peer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies
and private research organizations. Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.
Foster the People
"Foster the People is an American indie pop band from Los Angeles, California. Foster the People have four members: Mark Foster, Isom Innis, Mark Pontius, and Sean Cimino. Their best known song is ""Pumped Up Kicks"" which was released on September 14, 2010 and reached #1 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, #3 on the Rock Songs tally and #3 on the Billboard Hot 100."
Discography.
"So far as of 2014, Foster the People has released 2 Studio albums and 1 EP:"
Joseph-Louis Lagrange
"Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico [Luigi] Lagrangia, Turin, Piedmont, 25 January 1736 – Paris, 10 April 1813) was a mathematician and astronomer. According to one authority, he was ""the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century""."
"He lived part of his life in Prussia and part in France. He made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, from number theory, to classical and celestial mechanics."
"On the recommendation of Euler and d'Alembert, in 1766 Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He stayed there for over twenty years, producing a large body of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences."
Yeah.
"I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada."
"Uh, well part of it, touring."
"And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on."
"There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec"
Yeah.
and I had never heard any of that before.
"Yeah,"
"you know, there was, a, a,"
"what is it called,"
is it Meech Lake Accord?
Uh-huh.
"Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of"
"and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it."
"And, and came"
it was a big thing going on there
and I came back here
and nothing in the papers.
"Right,"
right.
I didn't see a thing about it.
"So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess."
It's improved.
"And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news."
"Even, even there's, uh, uh,"
it's it's semireligious in some respects.
But what is it?
"It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,"
"uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel."
"The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, I, it surprised me."
Right.
"Well ,"
"You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise."
"My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, we we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels"
"and they're very high strung animals to begin with,"
"but, uh,"
Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
"Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio."
"And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and just fall off on the articles that I like."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come."
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
"It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines"
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news."
Um.
It's really weird.
"Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long."
"But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news"
"and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper"
Um.
Okay.
"Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before."
Do you have children?
No.
No.
Okay.
"Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt."
Yeah.
"Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,"
I think it's a good idea.
"I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves."
Yeah.
"I think it's, uh,"
"would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about."
"I just, um,"
"I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,"
"and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
Did you?
something Oh!
"and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize"
Uh-huh.
"and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life"
"and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world"
"and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh."
Yeah.
Really
"Yeah,"
"I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,"
Yeah.
"they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do."
Yes.
Yeah.
"and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe."
"Oh, gosh."
"Yeah,"
"Lyndon LaRouche, that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected."
Uh-huh.
"Next thing you know, you've got him."
Right.
"If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together."
Yeah.
"You know, I like what he says,"
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
"Right, yeah."
"And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?"
Yeah.
Right.
That's what I thought.
"Yeah,"
he sure did.
"And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know."
He might do a good job.
Yeah.
"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long"
"Oh, yeah."
I think that discourages a lot of people.
"What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason,"
Uh-huh.
"We're just,"
"I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there."
I know.
I'm amazed.
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
Huh-uh.
"I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things."
"I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,"
"it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I know.
"Of course, I guess that's not bad."
Alan Alda did it on MASH.
I know.
Isn't that funny?
It hasn't hurt him at all.
"So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?"
"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues."
"That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to, have watched, you know."
"In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP."
Yeah.
"I mean, you don't have to ..."
That's one of our favorites
Yeah.
"You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,"
"so, you know, I usually don't like that."
"Right,"
"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,"
Uh-huh.
that's always a bummer too.
Uh-huh.
"And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,"
"but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,"
"if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out."
Uh-huh.
"And I make very good sales,"
"but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care."
"I mean, if, if they're not interested fine."
You know that's it.
You can't force them to be.
Right.
No.
"And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway."
Uh-huh.
That I don't think I could do anyway.
"But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or"
"sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star"
they get themselves in these rag sheets
"but, uh, I think they go too far."
"Oh, yeah"
I think that's invasion of privacy.
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.
Yeah
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.
"Oh, yeah."
"Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,"
so it's a different story then.
"You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon."
"He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air, you know."
And he has a chauffeur.
"I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either."
Uh-huh.
"I just don't, I don't see,"
"and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before"
"but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
right.
"And so, you know, they, they would just,"
"all the profits would go to, you know,"
"Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for,"
Yeah.
"they  can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun."
"Oh,  Oh , yeah,"
the owner's responsibility?
"You know, now  when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up"
Yeah.
"or, you know."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, that's, that's true."
"Uh, you know, I, I had a friend who was a, uh, a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of the small towns, uh near Pittsburgh."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she said that, that, uh, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that"
"but, I mean, you know, you're, you know,"
"people make, you know,"
"they forget or, you know, you know,"
"kids get in,"
"the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they can, you know."
Well they can get into almost anything anymore
Right.
"Okay Uh, let me see."
The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
Right.
"And it's a real big crunch, uh"
Uh-huh.
"of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,"
"but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them."
"So,"
"Well, that's right."
"Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste"
Uh-huh.
but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
Sure.
"I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles."
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
"And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,"
I mean it gave people jobs
Yeah.
"but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use."
"I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time"
"but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things."
So I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Okay,"
"well, it was good talking to you"
and have a good evening.
Okay
All right.
Yeah.
"Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks,"
"and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore."
"Yeah,"
"so do you have a, do you have a garden,"
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?
"Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, uh, like landscaping a little bit."
"You know, I've got some, uh, bushes around the you know, foundation planning, things like that,"
"and then there's some, just some little flower beds,"
"and my mom grows,"
"she's an avid gardener,"
"and she starts her own stuff from seed now,"
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.
"Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden."
"They have a huge yard and a huge house,"
and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.
"Well, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"My, my sister is very over zealous, too."
She's got some really nice flower beds.
She puts a lot of time into them.
"This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff."
"Oh, we, I've always had crude ones at my father's,"
but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.
Yeah.
His house is more like a farm house.
It's not on a main road.
Uh-huh.
"My house is on a main road,"
and it has nothing
Yeah.
"I mean, nothing."
"so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?"
"I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves."
Yeah.
"And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan."
Uh-huh.
"It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan."
Right.
But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
Uh-huh.
"So it's not, uh,"
"all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation."
"It's not going to build up, quite enough,"
yeah.
"So, I have to find a way to supplement that."
Yeah.
"Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save."
"You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,"
"but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check."
"And it's probably not a great investment,"
"but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know."
"I kind of have to trade off, you know."
"If you never see it you don't spend it,"
"so And it's,"
"I understand though,"
"it,"
Yeah.
"Uh, believe me, I do that myself."
Do you?
Yeah?
And I disagree with you.
Uh-huh.
I want to move up quick.
I want to make money quick.
I want to retire quick.
Yeah.
"And so anything,"
"when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four,  I'm thinking my time is running out. You know,"
Uh-huh.
"but I'm actually very, very young."
"Yeah,"
"you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is, my background is in journalism and corporate communications,"
Uh-huh.
"and what you'll find is,"
"I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where,"
"I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner,"
Uh-huh.
"but this is probably typical of the women's movement too,  is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school."
Uh-huh.
"I'm seriously considering going back to school for law.  Um, which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a subway ,"
Um.
Uh-huh.
but it's still is a different application.
"And I mean, if you think about it, you know, I I still can have another career."
I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine,  is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of,  I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome."
Uh-huh.
Right.
They have to eat real fast
"they have,  they have to, rapidity of speech,"
"Uh-huh,"
Oh.
"even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use."
"And I don't think it was my fault because I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
"but, uh, it was really, uh, it was,"
"I had to send it back after like, you know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not,"
"something was very, very wrong with the blade."
"Uh, what about you?"
"Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service."
Uh-huh.
I don't feel like that's as big a problem.
I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.
Uh-huh.
And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time."
Uh-huh.
But that's it.
"But that's, that's probably the worst."
"My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh, James Avery."
I don't know if you have that up there
"but it, it's a very good company. That  sells sterling silver things"
Uh-huh.
"and uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
"and when she stood up, it caught and broke"
and we took it back
"and they said oh, this was just obviously yanked."
Uh-huh.
This was yanked.
"I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time,"
and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music.
"Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes."
"I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues,"
"and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,"
"Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even."
"Right,"
right.
"Uh, well, that gets,"
"some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music,"
"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,"
"but the, the actual,"
"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even"
"Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music"
"Yeah,"
I guess.
"um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it"
Uh-huh.
Um.
Do you like rap?
"Um, some of it, um,"
it depends.
"I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um,"
and they usually do a lot of satire
Yeah
um.
that kind I kind of like.
Right.
"Some of it is kind of pointless,"
"Right,"
"Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, we were talking about child care"
and he asked me if I had any kids.
He was about forty or fifty years old
"and I said no, I'm just twenty,"
"He was ancient,"
yeah.
"and I said no, I'm just twenty-three,  you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children"
Uh-huh.
"but the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your life."
"And I just,"
"I,"
"my, my mind just went,"
You didn't know what you're going to be missing.
"I went, what. You know,"
"because it it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children,"
I don't have any either
"and I've been a married for eleven years,"
so.
"Yeah,"
"and I, it just, you know,"
"I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like,  just because, I'm not sure if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my career."
"Yeah,"
"when it's time,"
uh-huh.
"I'm trying to go somewhere, and,  and get there quick and then worry about, you know, because right now, in my career I'm, I'm really starting out,"
"Yeah,"
"you want to establish,"
and it's going to take me a while to move up.
"Uh-huh,"
"And I don't need anything kind of holding me back, um."
"It's a good general education for a, a bachelor's degree."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And obviously, and obviously it's where they don't have a, any post graduate program there,"
"but you get a, an excellent, wide, uh, basis of topics."
"You know, you get a good broad education out of it."
Uh-huh.
"You don't, they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors, but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh,"
"How do you feel about,"
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college.
"How does that, uh,"
"how do you feel that is for someone at, at that phase in their life?"
"Well, the for some people, it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline, need a little reining in at that, that stage in their life."
"Uh, other people,"
"it, uh, it's, uh, suffocating,"
Uh-huh.
"you know, you kind of choke on it"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"uh, it, it depends on the person, on the individual,"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the, the cost of, how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've, you've got a, your share of student loans that, uh, you're probably going to be paying off or have been"
"or,"
Exactly.
"And, then her little brother's only two years behind"
Exactly.
"and he says, well, I don't know,"
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.
"And I said, that's great."
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
"That's right,"
That's right
"Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff"
"and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,"
"but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go."
"I have, you know, all,"
this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've
"always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms"
"and so I've never had the, the big benefit package."
"So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know."
"It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered."
"So, I've been real pleased."
"Well, that's fantastic,"
Yeah.
"and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors."
Think so?
"Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits"
Uh-huh.
"but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
and you can pick what you want
"and, yeah."
now it's up to you
"it's menu selection, so, to speak."
And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
"And that's the way to do it, too."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you"
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.
Yeah.
"And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?"
"Preparing it,"
right.
"Oh, it sure does."
"Well,"
"Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,"
"Uh, go ahead,"
tell me what you think.
Do we get our money's worth?
"Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes."
"Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things."
"Yeah,"
did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
"No,"
I did not.
"I,"
"Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need."
"And, uh, it's staggering."
"Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you?"
"Uh, this,"
"I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady,"
"but this, I heard this on a Christian program"
"and it was, uh, about the N E A"
"and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,"
"and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money."
I do desktop publishing at work
and I have a machine at home
and I belong to the user's group
"and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out."
Yeah?
All right.
"But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry."
I don't work a computer company.
No?
I'm an abuser.
"Well, that's, that's all right."
"But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen."
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer"
"and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,"
"let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,"
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what baud rate do you get?
"Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred"
"So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city?"
"Is it, uh,"
"Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad."
"Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things."
"Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day."
"Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck."
"Oh, really."
"But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And they
"usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home"
Uh-huh.
"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time."
"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,"
and this is what I found with Emily.
"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area."
Uh-huh.
And I kept finding neighbors and friends
and they'd move.
Oh.
She ended up being in a different home every year.
Too transit.
Uh-huh.
And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
And her surroundings.
"So this year I, I tried Kinder-Care"
"and, then she's old enough to"
Okay.
"Well, let's see,"
"well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics"
"and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full."
I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
"Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?"
"No,"
"no,"
I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
"Well, maybe they don't."
"I, I know that was supposed to be in May"
"and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were."
"Oh, I see."
"Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a residential area."
Um.
"And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know,"
"this dog, being a small dog it's, uh, more you, more acceptable"
Yeah
"but again,"
it's not that big of a problem.
"With Domino, she was full grown,"
I would estimate seventy pounds.
Yeah.
"And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town,"
it's a suburb of Orlando
Uh-huh.
"but there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around,"
"and she was a dog that loved to run,"
"so that was the biggest problem I saw,"
"and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around,"
"or, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats."
"Me and cats don't get along too well, uh"
"but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns."
"It's like, uh,"
"there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,"
"but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"that, that,"
"and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise."
"Sure,"
"and that's all part of of keeping your part of the relationship. You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh, those issues."
"And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money."
"As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars."
Yep.
Right.
"And it was just,"
"I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,"
Yeah.
"so. So it gives you idea that,"
Yeah.
Definitely
I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
"Sure,"
sure.
"So,"
"I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think."
Than we think.
Sure.
Sure.
"But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure."
Uh-huh.
It sure is.
"The, you know, as far as,"
I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days
"and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing"
"but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this,"
and it was something more than just the conferences.
"They were using it as eating out, uh,"
"when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress."
Uh-huh.
"I, I'm amazed, at, at that's a lot of them even graduated."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"Well, I, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school. Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the doctorate research, and the professors who go there,"
Right.
Right.
and you're not going to see the professors
Nope.
"you know, you're going to see some T A, you know."
"Uh, so they they, they want, you know, they want the best"
"and they don't think, they think what the best is, is, reputation for, for research"
Yeah.
"and that's a one standard,"
"but it's not relevant, to what they need."
No.
"It's interesting that you mention,"
"and I didn't think about that before when you were talking,"
"but the service academies have all, all the faculty, uh, for the most part is, is military with a few exchange, professors from other, schools."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there, uh, is investing in the Air Force,"
"and it,"
Right.
"or the, the military itself, it's the future officer corps"
"and so, I hear horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors,"
they could never get extra help.
Uh-huh.
For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day I had all my instructors home phone numbers
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and particularly with, with back seat, uh, with some, where kids, were, were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on,"
"and they were thrown forward, into the front seat,"
"and there was enough stretching, the combination of stretching the spine to, uh, I mean, the serious injury, even though they were, they were still locked in the"
Right.
"they were forced to go,"
"so really if your sitting in the back seat, your better off not not to have your seat belt on, if it's just a seat belt."
Yeah.
"We have a van, that, uh, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness"
"Well, tell me about your van."
Do you like it?
"I have an Arrow Star van,"
we really do.
"Uh, it's, it's a mini van,"
"we've had it,"
goodness in May will be five years
"and, uh, they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty."
And the transmission was replaced
"but they really are nifty, uh,"
"the mini van, it's"
"actually, we had a station wagon before,"
"and it's a foot or two shorter than a,"
we had a regular size station wagon
Uh-huh.
"and it really, uh,"
"we like it,"
"it, the"
interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks.
"Huh. The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida"
Uh-huh.
"and, like I said, I mean, we're not that old"
"but my husband works for the State,"
and after a certain amount of years you can retire.
right.
"and then there was a big climactic fight scene,"
"and they didn't remember that,"
"they didn't fight together,"
"they fought individually,"
"and they failed individually,"
"and then that was it,"
then they had to have the Master beat him
Right.
"and the Master should, according to the classic myth, the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth, he, the Master should have died at the end because the, the lesson was passed to the young generation"
Right.
and the older generation is not needed
"and is reborn to the younger generation,"
"and on and on and on, and all this wonderful mess"
Uh-huh.
"and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that, I, anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate,"
"it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that,"
"and it would have make it, uh, broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for, I thought"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I'm truly enough, you know, I'm truly an intellectual snob, to be going to these kinds of movies,"
"I realize that. I mean, to go to these movies and expect them to be, you know, other than just, just good entertainment kind of thing."
Right.
That's true.
"Yeah,"
"there's not too many that are, uh, that are good just on their, you know, that, that you wouldn't want to change something,"
"and there's always something that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I, I'm very, I'm very critical,"
"I, I, I'm actually originally from Hollywood,"
"and then, then, then"
"Rob McElhenney revealed at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con that he had written an episode for this season involving the gang becoming contestants on the game show ""Family Feud."" While ""Family Feud"" producers were receptive to the storyline, FX refused to allow the episode to proceed to production."
"The season premiered on September 4, 2013, and contains 10 episodes. The series' landmark 100th episode aired on October 9."
"The first episode of the season premiered with the lowest number of U.S. viewers since it has been tracked for the show. This was primarily due to the new channel, FXX, being unavailable from many television providers. Many Suddenlink Communications franchises, although carrying the channel, have required the subscriber to buy a ""Sports Package"" in order to receive the network. Nonetheless, FX Network president John Landgraf said that ""the numbers last night [...] far exceeded our highest expectations"" and that ""To have just launched the channel three days ago and get these ratings is thrilling."""

"Lev Zacharovitch Aronson (Lew Aronson, Lev Aronoff, Lev Aronov, Lev Arnoff, Lew Arnow, Lew Arnoff-Aramon, Lew Arnoff-Aronson) (February 7, 1912 – November 12, 1988) was an Eastern European-American cellist and cello teacher."
"Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in Mönchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhoschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhoschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia)."
"Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow."
"Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven."
"In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello. As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well-known physician and cellist in Riga."
"Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931."
"In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing. Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia. He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life."
"German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents."
"Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla."
"In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof."
"From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was among one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians."
"Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947."
"Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin."
"Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist."
"Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979."
"Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the ""Chevalier du violoncello"" by the Janzer Foundation."
"Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments. He founded and conducted the Dal-Hi Chamber Players, a group of young musicians who performed in the United States and abroad in the 1970s. He taught and judged at numerous music festivals, workshops, and competitions. He even taught a course for the Southern Methodist University Continuing Education program, which introduced adults to western art music."
"Aronson's students include Lynn Harrell, Ralph Kirshbaum, Kristi Curb, Brian Thornton, John Sharp, Adron Ming, Brook Pearce, James R. Denton, Christopher Adkins, Laurie Arnold, Alicia Randisi-Hooker, Karen Terbeek, Carol Haski, Philip Taggart, Kevin Dvorak, Richard Pope, Jonathan Reimer, Rebecca Young, and Mitch Maxwell."

= = = Paradise Valley High School = = =
"Paradise Valley High School (PVHS) was the first of five high schools built in the Paradise Valley Unified School District, located in Phoenix, Arizona. Paradise Valley High School opened in 1957. The school's athletic teams are referred to as the Trojans. Featuring a Block Schedule, Paradise Valley teaches a wide selection of courses in not only core academics but also technology and the arts. The football program installed one of the first artificial turfs in the state, the only Sprinturf installation in Arizona, as its main football, soccer, and track field at a cost of $1 million."
"Paradise Valley opened in 1957 at Bell Road and 40th street which at the time was on the outskirts of Phoenix. The original campus consisted of an administration building, several small classroom buildings and a small gymnasium and athletic fields located to the north of the classroom buildings. In the 1960s a library, cafeteria, shop building and three larger classroom buildings were added to the campus. The gymnasium was also expanded in the 1960s. In the early 1970s a new building called the 700 building was constructed. Between 1976 and 1979 several new buildings designed by the Tempe architecture office of Michael & Kemper Goodwin Ltd. The plan included a new vocational education building and an additional physical education building. In 1982 the remaining 1957 classroom buildings were demolished to make way for a larger classroom building. The new building was nearly complete when the 1983-1984 school year began. At that time the 1960s buildings were updated. In 1983 the 700 building was demolished to make way for a new 1,200 seat auditorium and associated fine arts building. The auditorium and fine arts building were completed in 1984. In 1990 it was decided that Paradise Valley would close its original campus and move to a new campus being constructed at Union Hills Drive and 16th Street. The new campus opened for the 1991-1992 school year. It was then decided that the original campus would be renovated and reopened. The original gymnasium as well as the administration building were demolished and rebuilt and the campus was thoroughly spruced up. The updated school reopened for the 1993-1994 school year. The new campus on Union Hills was then renamed North Canyon High School. The CREST STEM program was established in 2010 offering students classes in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. In 2013 the three 1960s classroom buildings were demolished to make way for two new twin story buildings housing the science department and CTE classes. In 2013 the auditorium was also completely renovated. The 2013 projects were completed by McCarthy Construction."
When the school was established the Paradise Valley High School District was also created. In July 1976 the high school district unified with the elementary district to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District.

The road begins at SH 71 in Bee Cave in Travis County west of Austin passing along southeastern Lake Travis, western Austin, and several suburban communities west and north of Austin before ending at Bus. I-35-L in Round Rock in Williamson County. The road has major intersections with I-35, US 183, and SH 45."
"The road opened in 1945 as a Farm to Market Road. The road is now officially designated by TxDOT as Urban Road 620, but all Urban Roads in Texas retain their former Farm or Ranch to Market highway signs."
"RM 620 was originally designated on July 9, 1945 as Farm to Market Road 620 from Round Rock to SH 29, the former designation of US 183 south of Liberty Hill until May 23, 1951. On May 13, 1946, the road was extended to the Travis County line. On August 26, 1948, the road was extended to the former community of Hickmuntown, also called Four Points, at the location of the current intersection with RM 2222. The road was completed on December 17, 1952 when it was extended to SH 71, known locally before August 31, 1965 as RM 93 (but was signed as SH 71 since October 31, 1955). The road received its Ranch to Market designation on October 1, 1956, and its Urban Road designation on June 27, 1995. The SH 45 toll road running along a portion of RM 620 opened in 2006.

= = = Jim McDaniels = = =
"James Ronald McDaniels (April 2, 1948 – September 6, 2017) was an American professional basketball player. McDaniels played collegiately for Western Kentucky University and was the No. one overall pick in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft. McDaniels was an NBA All-Star."
"A 6'11"" power forward/center, McDaniels averaged nearly 40 points per game as a senior at Allen County High School in Scottsville, Kentucky. From 1967 to 1971, he played at Western Kentucky University, leading his team to a third-place finish in the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. (The NCAA later voided Western Kentucky's participation in the tournament, accusing McDaniels of signing with an agent while still in college.) He also set WKU school records with 2,238 career points (now tied with Courtney Lee) and 1,118 career rebounds."
"McDaniels was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft and No. one overall by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft, but he began his professional career with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association, who offered him a $1.35 million contract to be paid over twenty-five years. Reportedly, the Cougars first approached McDaniels during November 1970, while he was still playing for Western Kentucky. McDaniels averaged 26.8 points and 14 rebounds in 58 games with the Cougars during the 1971–72 season and scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game. However, he feuded with the Cougars while trying to renegotiate his contract – he wanted his salary to be spread over fifteen years, rather than twenty-five – and near the end of his rookie season he decided to leave the Cougars for the SuperSonics."
"McDaniels remained with Seattle for the next two full seasons. However, he struggled to maintain the same level of production he had achieved in the ABA, and by the 1973–74 NBA season, McDaniels was averaging just 5.5 points per game. During that time, McDaniels was dogged by off-court troubles as the Cougars questioned the legality of his jump to the NBA. He later admitted in an interview, ""I should have stayed in the ABA for a couple of years. I was just young and things started going bad for me there and I didn't know how to handle them."" SuperSonics coach and general manager Bill Russell ultimately released McDaniels in fall 1974."

= = = Phileine Says Sorry = = =
"Phileine Says Sorry () is a Dutch/American 2003 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Jan Westdijk. It is based on the novel ""Phileine zegt sorry"" by Ronald Giphart."
"The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York."
"On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early."
"In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife."
"Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others."
"On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end."
"At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant."
"A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage."
"The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument."
"The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi."
"The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: ""Sorry that I exist."""

"In the spring of 602, the Goth Witteric, one of the conspirators with Sunna de Mérida to reestablish Arianism in 589, was given command of the army to repulse the Byzantines. From his position of power at the head of the army, he surrounded himself with people in his confidence. When it came time to expel the Byzantines, Witteric instead used his troops to strike at the king in the spring of 603. Invading the royal palace, and deposing the young king, he counted on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. Witteric cut off the king's right hand and later had him condemned and executed in the summer of 603."
= = = William Howard Taft National Historic Site = = =
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site is a historic house at 2038 Auburn Avenue in the Mount Auburn Historic District of Cincinnati, Ohio, a mile (1.6 km) north of Downtown. It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. The two-story Greek Revival house, built circa 1835, is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city."
"William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General."
"The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival."
"Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise."
"The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector."
"William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister."

= = = Gilbert Brown = = =
"Gilbert Jesse Brown (born February 22, 1971) is a former American football player. A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993–99, 2001–03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed ""The Gravedigger,"" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991."
"Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit."
"During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989."
"Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, ""The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other."""
"With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year."
"He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989–92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7½ career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks’ ‘Co-Defensive Most Valuable Player’ and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991."
"He came up with the ""Gravedigger"" move at Kansas—after a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname."
He majored in human development.
"Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season."
"Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the ""Gilbertburger"" — a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles — always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants."
"Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved."
"Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. ""That was outrageous, I never got that big,"" said Brown. ""The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that."" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994."
"After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, ""If I didn’t think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here""."
"Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup."
"On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more."
"Gilbert was featured in the ""Sports Illustrated"" special, ""Where Are They Now?"", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps."
"Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish. In 2002, he combined his love for cars with his desire to give back when he organized a car show, Gilbert Brown and Friends, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, which benefited the Make-a-Wish Foundation."
"Galesville, Wisconsin establishment Champions Sports Bar and Grill has a burger named in Brown's honor: the Gravedigger burger, which weighs in at 93 ounces (just over 5¾ lbs). The weight of the burger is a callback to Brown's jersey number, which was 93."
"On October 23, 2007, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League announced that Brown had signed a three-year contract to be the team's new head coach. The Bonecrushers began their season in March. However On Tuesday, April 8, 2008, Gilbert Brown resigned as head coach of the Milwaukee Bonecrushers citing irreconcilable differences with ownership."
"On December 11, 2007, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, Inc., Tuesday announced Brown would be inducted into the Hall at the 38th Hall of Fame Induction Banquet, to be held the evening of July 19, 2008, in the Lambeau Field Atrium."
"On August 6, 2009, it was announced that Brown would return to coaching as the first head coach of the expansion La Crosse Spartans of the Indoor Football League."
"On April 1, 2011, Brown announced he was taking a leave of absence from the La Crosse Spartans."
"As of Aug. 2011, Brown is the head coach of the Green Bay Chill of the Lingerie Football League, which was later renamed as the Legends Football League."
"On March 12, 2014 Gilbert Brown and his project partner, the Vistelar Group, launched an IndieGoGo project to raise money for the production/development/distribution of curriculum to counteract bullying, called the Bully-Proofing Playbook for Parents, Teachers & Kids."

= = = Thomas Devin = = =
"Thomas Casimer Devin (December 10, 1822 – April 4, 1878) was a United States Army officer and general. He commanded Union cavalry during the American Civil War and during the Indian Wars."
"Born in New York City to Irish parents. Devin was a house painter and partner in a paint and varnish company with his brother John for much of his early life, while also serving as a lieutenant colonel in the New York State Militia."
"After the start of the Civil War, Devin formed his militia cavalry company into ""Captain Devin's Independent Company"" and served as its captain. Late that year, he became Colonel of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the ""2nd Ira Harris Guards"", which he would lead for the next year."
"The regiment's first important service was in the Maryland Campaign of 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, one of its squadrons was involved in the first attacks of the day. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Devin inherited command of David McMurtrie Gregg's cavalry brigade, when the latter took charge of the brigade of George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed by Confederate artillery fire. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, his small brigade was the only cavalry not detached for Brig. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and he successfully led three Union Corps on the stealthy flanking march that preceded the battle. The men of the brigade repeatedly distinguished themselves in the heavy fighting of the battle. They suffered almost 200 casualties in the battle, higher losses than Union cavalry units had seen prior to that time. Devin also led his brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station (June 9, 1863), and took command of Brig. Gen. John Buford's division while Buford commanded the entire right wing of the two-pronged attack on Confederate cavalry. While observing the skirmish line early in the fighting, Devin had his horse shot out from under him."
"At the Battle of Gettysburg, Devin's brigade served in Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division that began the battle on July 1, 1863. Devin had become a favorite of Buford's and his rugged leadership style lent him the nickname ""Buford's Hard Hitter,"" while his own men like to refer to him as ""Uncle Tommy."" As the Confederate attacks began, Devin's brigade was screening the northwest and northern road approaches to Gettysburg, and successfully delayed the arrival of Jubal A. Early's division. Friendly fire from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill caused most of his brigade to withdraw into the town of Gettysburg and they later skirmished with the Confederates as they entered the town. The two brigades of Buford's cavalry division present on the field on July 1 and 2 were withdrawn from the battlefield by Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton on the afternoon of July 2."
"After Gettysburg, Devin continued to command a brigade and sometimes a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1864, he participated in the raid on Richmond by Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry. In August he accompanied the Cavalry Corps to the Shenandoah Valley, where they fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Devin was wounded once during the war, a wound in the foot on August 16, 1864, at the fighting at Guard Hill, Virginia or Crooked Run, Virginia. When Wesley Merritt became the Cavalry Corps commander, Devin inherited command of his division. On November 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Devin brigadier general of volunteers for his part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from October 19, 1864. The President submitted the nomination on December 12, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed it on February 14, 1865."
"Devin was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866. President Johnson also appointed Devin brevet colonel in the regular army for Fisher's Hill, to rank from March 2, 1867. On March 26, 1867, President Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army for Sayler's Creek, to rank from March 2, 1867, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 5, 1867."
"Devin obtained a commission in the Regular Army after the Civil War under the provisions of the Army Act of 1866. This Act required that the officer ranks of the new infantry and cavalry regiments be filled by a certain percentage of officers from the Volunteer regiments raised during the Civil War. Ending the war as a Brigadier General and Brevet Major General, Devin became a Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to the 8th U.S. Cavalry. Initially serving with part of the regiment in New Mexico, Devin assumed command of the Subdistrict of Prescott in Arizona in late 1867. He died of stomach cancer and exposure, on sick leave from active duty, as Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Cavalry. Devin was initially interred in Calvary Cemetery on Long Island, but upon his wife's death in 1897, both were interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York, very near his old friend and commander John Buford."
"On June 30, 1878, the United States Army established a temporary camp in southeastern Montana Territory during the building of the Fort Keogh-Deadwood Telegraph Line. The post was named ""Camp Devin."" It served as a base for part of the 9th U.S. Infantry until being abandoned later that year."
"Devin was portrayed by David Carpenter in the 1993 film ""Gettysburg"", based on Michael Shaara's novel, ""The Killer Angels""."

= = = Alberto J. Mora = = =
Alberto J. Mora (born 1951) is a former General Counsel of the Navy. He led an effort within the Defense Department to oppose the legal theories of John Yoo and to try to end the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay.
"Mora is featured in two documentaries: the 2008 Academy Award-winning ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" and ""Torturing Democracy""."
"Mora was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Cuba. His father, a medical doctor and professor, is Cuban, and his mother's parents are from Hungary, which they fled in advance of active Hungarian-German cooperation in 1941. Mora's family fled Cuba after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 when Mora was eight years old. Mora's family relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, where Mora lived until leaving for college. He received a B.A., with honors, from Swarthmore College in 1974."
"From 1975 to 1978 he worked for the U.S. State Department as a foreign service officer at the U.S. embassy in Lisbon, Portugal. He left to enter law school at the University of Miami School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1981. He worked in litigation at a number of firms, until returning to government work. From 1989 to 1993, he served in the administration of the President George H.W. Bush as general counsel to the United States Information Agency. He was later appointed three times by President Bill Clinton to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees the Voice of America and other U.S. information services. He also worked as an Of Counsel attorney with the prominent law firm of Greenberg Traurig, at their Washington office, focusing on matters of international law."
"Mora speaks Spanish, French, and Portuguese. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations."
"In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Mora as the General Counsel of the Navy, the most senior civilian lawyer for the Navy, after a recommendation by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, who is friends with Mora."
"Mora was in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when it was struck by the Boeing 757 of American Airlines Flight 77. Mora said that it ""felt jarring, like a large safe had been dropped overhead."""
"Mora retired from the Federal Government in January 2006. He became the chief counsel for Wal-Mart's international division and later served as general counsel and secretary of Mars, Inc."
"In December 2002, Mora received word from David Brant, director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), that NCIS agents at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba had learned that detainees being held there were being subjected to ""physical abuse and degrading treatment"" by members of the Joint Task Force 170 (JTF-170), and that authorization for this treatment had come from ""a 'high level' in Washington"". Mora reports that he was ""disturbed"" and felt he had to learn more."

Officially opened on 15 October 1981, the hospital currently provides 920 psychiatric beds, serving the population of Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi, Tsuen Wan, Tung Chung, North Lantau and part of Kowloon."
"Apart from in-patient psychiatric services for adult psychiatric patients, it also develops psychiatric specialty services which include Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services, Psychogeriatric Services, Community Psychiatry, Consultation Liaison Services, Substance Abuse Assessment Unit and Psychiatric Unit for Learning Disabilities."
The hospital also provides out-patient department and day hospital services for psychiatric patients at West Kowloon Psychiatric Centre and East Kowloon Psychiatric Centre.
The hospital is reachable by Lai King Hill Road.
"Kwai Chung Hospital began its operations in November 1980 and was officially opened on 15 October 1981 by the Hong Kong Governor, Murray MacLehose."
= = = Jōkō Ninomiya = = =
"Joko Ninomiya was born on January 27, 1954, in Yawatahama, Shikoku, Japan. Ninomiya was the youngest of 10 brothers and sisters. His family owned and tended to several fruit orchards. To augment the family's income, his father also worked as a carpenter."
"In seventh grade, at age 12, Ninomiya began training in a Judo class taught by a teacher at his junior high school. He earned his first degree black belt by the end of eighth grade. After turning 14, Ninomiya did extra Judo training at the local police station gym on weekends and holidays. It was there that he met the man who would become his teacher and mentor in karate- Hideyuki Ashihara. One year later, in 1969, Ninomiya began training in Ashihara's Kyokushin dojo."
"Hideyuki Ashihara began training in Kyokushin karate at the honbu dojo in 1971 when he was 16 years old. Kyokushin(kai) is a full contact, knockdown style of karate founded by Mas Oyama. Ashihara attained first degree black belt in Kyokushin in 1974. Two years after that he became an instructor, and two years after that he was allowed to open his own dojo in Ninomiya's home town of Yawatahama."
"During this time, Ashihara was developing his own approach to the Kyokushin curriculum he was teaching his students as well as adding additional movements and techniques that he had devised. His techniques involved using circular patterns to move outside of an opponent's attack and then to counterattack from a position of advantage. These techniques also involved parries and sweeps intended to use the opponent's momentum against him. He always stressed getting the maximum impact from a minimum amount of force. Ashihara called these techniques, ""Sabaki."" Although many of these techniques were prohibited in Kyokushin Knockdown karate tournament rules, he taught them to his students, including Ninomiya, so that they would be more effective, all-around karate fighters. Many renowned karate students came to train at Ashihara's dojo because of his reputation as an extremely effective instructor."
"When Ninomiya was 17, he received his brown belt in Kyokushin from Ashihara and was chosen to compete in the All-Japan Tournament as the youngest competitor. He lost in the second round to eventual tournament champion Katsuaki Satō."
"Ninomiya trained hard for the next year's tournament, including spending three weeks living and training alone at a beach some distance from his home town. At his second All-Japan tournament in 1972 he lost in the third round to eventual tournament champion Miyuki Miura."
"During this time, Ninomiya had continued to train and compete in judo, as well as in karate. However, with graduation from high school, he stopped training in judo and trained full-time in karate, when not working in various jobs, including as a nightclub security guard. Ninomiya was now a 1st degree black belt in Kyokushin. At the 1973 All-Japan tournament, he lost again in the third round, this time to eventual tournament champion Hatsuo Royama."
"One month after the 1973 tournament, Ninomiya was chosen, along with five others, to go to live and train at the three Kyokushin dojo in New York City. Two of the American fighters that trained with them there were William Oliver and Willie Williams. The other five members of the group returned to Japan after two months, but Ninomiya stayed in New York to teach and train. Because of visa problems, he was unable to compete in the 1974 All-Japan tournament."
"In October, 1975, 21-year-old Joko Ninomiya returned to Japan to compete in the first All-World Tournament. In the semi-finals, he once again faced Katsuaki Satō. After a three-overtime match, Satō won the match by judge's decision. Satō then won the subsequent title match against Hatsuo Royama. Ninomiya finished in third place. The tournament was filmed for a documentary, called ""Fighting Black Kings"" that also profiled several of the competitors, including William Oliver and Willie Williams."
"Ninomiya returned to New York and prepared for the next year's All-Japan tournament. At the tournament, his quarter-final match went to three overtimes before he was awarded the decision. His semi-final match went two overtimes before he was again awarded the decision. Extremely fatigued, Ninomiya had only 10-minutes to rest and prepare for the final match against Toshikazu Satō which Satō won. Ninomiya returned to New York to resume teaching and training."
"Ninomiya was unable to compete in the 1977 All-Japan due to a training accident involving a sword that almost severed his left thumb. Instead, he decided to move to Denver to open his own Kyokushin dojo. His first classes were held in a neighborhood health club. However, he was subsequently able to rent a vacant store to use as a training dojo. He soon had a dedicated core of students."
"The next year, Ninomiya returned to Japan briefly for his father's funeral. Seven months later, he returned again for the 1978 All-Japan Tournament. In the final match, Ninomiya defeated Keiji Sanpei to win the All-Japan championship. He then retired from tournament competition to concentrate full-time on teaching karate."
"In 1980 Hideyuki Ashihara left the Kyokushin organization and started his own style- Ashihara Karate. Ninomiya directed the US region of Ashihara Karate from Denver. Over the next eight years, Ashihara Karate slowly increased in size in the US and around the world."
"During this time, Ninomiya states that he had developed strategies and ideas of his own that he was eager to implement in his training curriculum. He also wanted to develop his own tournament format that would provide what he felt to be a ""true"" test of karate skills. Therefore, in May, 1988, Ninomiya decided to leave Ashihara Karate and start his own style. Most of the instructors and students of Ashihara in the US decided to follow Ninomiya into his new organization Enshin kaikan, providing a strong base for the new style- Enshin Karate."
"Since 1988, Enshin Karate has continued to be headquartered at Ninomiya's honbu in Denver. The organization has grown and now includes schools in Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East, as well as in the US. Ninomiya's idea for an open, knockdown-rules tournament that promotes the Sabaki method became the Sabaki Challenge which has been held annually in Denver since 1989."
"Ninomiya travels extensively in his position as director of the Enshin organization. He attends the openings of new dojo, presides over Enshin sabaki tournaments, and conducts seminars on the sabaki method. When not traveling he trains and instructs at the honbu in Denver."
= = = Maqsood Ahmed = = =
"Maqsood Ahmed (26 March 1925 – 4 January 1999) was a Pakistani cricketer who played in 16 Test matches from 1952 to 1955. He was educated at Islamia College, Lahore."
"Maqsood Ahmed was a useful all rounder in the first ever cricket team of Pakistan. Before the creation of Pakistan, he played for Southern Punjab in India, scoring 144 in his very first match. An aggressive hitter of the ball, Maqsood played a vital role in the recognition of Pakistan as test playing nation when he made 137 against the visiting MCC in 1951–52."
"A right-handed middle-order batsman, Maqsood was a hard hitter of the ball and is one of the Test cricketers whose highest score was 99, which he made in the Third Test against India in 1954–55. Though a brilliant batsman, his performance in Test matches was rather irregular because of his carefree attitude. In England in 1952 he became the first Pakistani to play as a professional cricketer. The English press dubbed him ""Merry Max""."
"He played 16 Test matches, scoring a total of 507 runs. He was also a right-arm medium fast bowler with three wickets in test matches to his credit. His first-class record is better, with 3815 runs in 85 matches between 1945 and 1964, including six centuries. He also took 124 wickets, with 7 for 39 and 6 for 44 against Sargodha in 1962–63 his best bowling figures. He was the leading bowler in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1962–63 with 34 wickets at an average of 9.29. He captained Karachi Blues and Rawalpindi in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy."
"After retiring from cricket, Maqsood Ahmed worked as a commentator and sports journalist for PTV, BBC and Radio Pakistan. He also served as the Chief National Cricket Coach and coached many Test stars including Intikhab Alam, Asif Iqbal, Mushtaq Mohammad, Sadiq Mohammad and Majid Khan. He was the Chairman of the National Selection Committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board which selected the World Cup winning team in 1991–92."

"WPXT, virtual channel 51 (UHF digital channel 43), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Portland, Maine, United States, serving southern Maine and eastern and northern New Hampshire. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications, as part of a duopoly with Poland Spring-licensed ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The two stations share studios on Ledgeview Drive in Westbrook; WPXT's transmitter is located in South Gray along I-95/Maine Turnpike/Gold Star Memorial Highway. There is no separate website for WPXT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WMTW."
"The station signed-on September 14, 1986 as Maine's first independent station and the first new commercial station to launch in the Portland market in 32 years. After a few weeks as an independent, it became a charter affiliate with Fox on October 6. In 1996, the station's original owner, Bride Communications, entered bankruptcy and WPXT was sold to Pegasus Broadcasting."
"In October 2001, WPXT switched to The WB due to a monetary dispute between Pegasus and Fox; The WB had previously aired in off-hours on sister UPN affiliate WPME (channel 35). This left Maine with no over-the-air Fox affiliate until April 2003, when Portland's Pax TV affiliate WMPX-TV (now WPFO) switched to the network and WFVX-LD signed on as the first over-the-air Fox affiliate for the Bangor area. In the interim, Fox's primetime and children's programming was only available on cable via WFXT (which was owned by the network at the time) for those living on the New Hampshire side of the market and via Foxnet for those living in Maine; WCKD-LP (which was initially expected to serve as the network's replacement affiliate) carried the network's sports programming during that time. Pegasus declared bankruptcy in June 2004 over a dispute with DirecTV (co-owned with Fox by News Corporation) over marketing of the direct broadcast satellite service in rural areas. The Pegasus station group was sold in August 2006 to private investment firm CP Media, LLC of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for $55.5 million. Eventually, CP Media formed a new broadcast company, New Age Media."
"As a WB affiliate, WPXT was originally branded on-air as ""Maine's WB 51"", but in 2004, changed to ""Maine's WB"" to reflect its status as the only over-the-air WB affiliate in the state. Although Bangor and Presque Isle also had affiliates, they were only provided on cable through The WB 100+ (a similar operation to Foxnet)."
"On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would merge the broadcast operations of The WB and UPN to form The CW Television Network. On March 9, it was announced WPXT would become Portland's CW affiliate. Later on May 1, it was made public sister station WPME would affiliate with MyNetworkTV. With the new affiliation, WPXT's branding became ""The CW Portland"". In 2007, WPXT changed its on-air branding to reflect its call letters rather than a city."
"WPXT ceased analog transmission August 12, 2008 (more than seven months prior to the original Federal Communications Commission (FCC) digital switchover deadline February 17, 2009) due to transmitter failure. On May 2, 2011, WPXT signed-on a new second digital subchannel to become the area's MeTV affiliate. On November 7, 2016, Escape (now Court TV Mystery) was added to subchannel 51.3."
"New Age Media announced in March 2012 that it would sell WPXT to Tyche Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPME's concurrent sale from MPS Media to Triumph Broadcasting. On November 9, 2012, WPXT filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction is nulled and void. On February 13, 2013, New Age Media filed to sell WPXT to Ironwood Communications for $1,525,000; the deal was concurrent with a planned sale of WPME to Cottonwood Communications. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20."
"On March 22, 2018, MyNetworkTV, Escape and Laff programming was moved to WPXT's respective third, fourth and fifth subchannels; the three networks had been carried by WPME, which was concurrently sold to Ion Media Networks to become WIPL, an Ion Television owned-and-operated station. Hearst Television announced its acquisition of WPXT on July 30, 2018; the $3,350,000 purchase created a duopoly with ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The sale was approved on September 12 and was completed on September 21, 2018; concurrently, WPXT changed its branding to ""Maine's CW."""
"The ownership change also resulted in a streamlining of subchannels between WMTW and WPXT the next month. With Hearst's preference for its main station in the market to carry the MeTV affiliation, MeTV and H&I exchanged places, with MeTV moving to WMTW-DT2 and H&I going to WPXT-DT2, and Laff going from WPXT-DT2 to WMTW-DT3, with Escape going to WPXT-DT3 (and the likely non-renewal of the Katz Broadcasting network agreement; Hearst only tends to carry Bounce TV from that provider). The syndicated programming formerly on WPXT-DT3's ""WPME"" service was removed, and MyNetworkTV programming now airs in place of H&I's primetime, or sometimes during the late night hours on WPXT-DT2, an arrangement similar to the setup for the third subchannel of sister station KCCI in Des Moines, Iowa."
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
"Syndicated programming on WPXT includes ""Divorce Court"", ""The People's Court"", ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Modern Family"", ""Mom"", ""Extra"", ""TMZ on TV"", and ""Chicago P.D."", among others. Throughout its history, WPXT has also produced and aired several local programs."
"For many years, WPXT operated a news department and produced its own local newscasts. For a time, the station's nightly prime time news at 10 was simulcasted on sister station WPME. WPXT even produced a weeknight broadcast at 7 on that station at one point but the show was eventually canceled due to poor ratings and inconsistent viewership. It made national headlines a week before the 2000 Presidential election when reporter Erin Fehlau (now at ABC affiliate WMUR-TV) revealed Republican candidate George W. Bush had been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol 24 years earlier."
"On June 15, 2002, after shuttering its own news operation, WPXT entered into a news share agreement with Maine's two NBC affiliates, WCSH and WLBZ (then both owned by the Gannett Company). This arrangement resulted in a nightly half-hour prime time show at 10 to debut on the station known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on Maine's WB 51"". On weeknights, the news and sports segments originated from WCSH's studios at Congress Square in Downtown Portland while weather forecast segments came from WLBZ's facility on Mount Hope Avenue in Bangor. Weekend broadcasts aired entirely from Portland. The WPXT newscast featured a similar format to newscasts that were simulcast on both WCSH and WLBZ (which largely serves as a semi-satellite of WCSH), with statewide news from both the Portland and Bangor markets. However, since WPXT is a Portland/Auburn market station, there was ultimately a focus on southern areas. With the affiliation switch to The CW in 2006, WPXT's news became known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on The CW Portland""."
"WPXT would not face any competition in the time slot until February 5, 2007, when current Fox affiliate WPFO entered into a similar arrangement with CBS affiliate WGME-TV. On November 6, 2008, WCSH moved the WPXT show to its second digital subchannel affiliated with NBC Weather Plus. As a result, WLBZ's production involvement in the newscast was dropped and refocused to Portland. After a six-year run, the production was eventually canceled altogether."
"On October 31, 2011, WPXT and WCSH established another news share agreement and debuted an hour-long extension of the big three outlet's weekday morning show. Known on WPXT as ""NewsCenter Morning Report Xtra"", this aired from 7 until 8 and competed with WGME's one-hour morning newscast on WPFO. This ceased in Spring 2014."

"Mu'in ad-Din Unur al-Atabeki (; died August 28, 1149) was the Turkish ruler of Damascus in the mid-12th century."
"Mu'in ad-Din was originally a Mameluk in the army of Toghtekin, the founder of the Burid Dynasty of Damascus. When Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo, besieged Damascus in 1135, Mu'in ad-Din was at the head of army defending the city. That year the Burid Shihab ad-Din Mahmud took control of Damascus after the assassination of his brother; when Zengi gave up the siege and instead besieged Homs, Shihab ad-Din sent Yusuf ibn Firuz and Mu'in ad-Din to govern it, with Yusuf acting as Mu'in ad-Din's lieutenant. In 1137 Mu'in ad-Din was still governor of Homs when the city was briefly besieged again by Zengi. In 1138, Shihab ad-Din appointed Mu'in ad-Din atabeg of Damascus and gave him the title ""Isfahsaller"". Later in 1138, Zengi negotiated a marriage between himself and Shihab ad-Din's mother Khatun Safwat al-Mulk, and as part of the settlement Zengi received Homs. Mu'in ad-Din was given the castle of Barin in place of Homs. On June 22, 1139, Shihab ad-Din was assassinated in Damascus; Jamal ad-Din, emir of Baalbek, was chosen as his successor, and Mu'in ad-Din was chosen to govern Baalbek in his absence. He was in charge of the defenses of Baalbek when Zengi arrived to avenge the murder of his stepson. Zengi besieged it with 14 catapults and the city surrendered to him."
"In 1140 Jamal ad-Din died, and Mu'in ad-Din continued to rule as regent for Jamal ad-Din's son Mujir ad-Din. That year, Mu'in ad-Din besieged Banias with help from King Fulk of Jerusalem and Prince Raymond of Antioch; Mu'in ad-Din offered 20 000 pieces of gold per month to pay for their expenses. When it was captured, Mu'in ad-Din handed it over to Fulk and returned to Damascus. A more thorough alliance, to protect Damascus against Zengi, was negotiated during a visit by Mu'in ad-Din to Jerusalem, accompanied by the future chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh."
"King Fulk died in 1143, and Zengi was assassinated in 1146. Zengi was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din Ghazi I in Mosul and Nur ad-Din in Aleppo, and Mu'in ad-Din took the opportunity to besiege Baalbek; the governor, Najm ad-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin, quickly surrendered to him. Mu'in ad-Din also asserted control over Homs and Hama, and sent Yarankash, the assassin of Zengi, to Nur ad-Din, after Yarankash sought refuge in Damascus."
"Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's power, but it was his policy to remain on friendly terms with his neighbours wherever possible, whether they were Christian or Muslim. In 1147 Nur ad-Din and Mu'in ad-Din negotiated an alliance, in which Nur ad-Din married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Having established peace with Aleppo, Mu'in ad-Din set out to besiege Salkhad and Bosra, after their governor, Altuntash, allied with Jerusalem against him. This broke Jerusalem's treaty with Damascus, forcing Mu'in ad-Din to turn to Nur ad-Din for assistance. Nur ad-Din arrived with the army of Aleppo, and the crusaders were forced to withdraw; both Bosra and Sarkhad then surrendered to Mu'in ad-Din. In August 1147 Mu'in ad-Din was formally recognized as governor of Damascus by the Caliph of Baghdad Al-Muqtafi and the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud, and he was also recognized formally by the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, al-Hafiz."
"In 1148 news reached Damascus of a new crusade, called in response to Zengi's capture of Edessa in 1145. Mu'in ad-Din prepared for the inevitable siege, although he had hoped his former alliance with Jerusalem could be restored and that the crusade would attack some other city. When the crusaders arrived in July, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Mu'in ad-Din ""distinguished himself in combat with them, and displayed a valour, steadfastness and gallantry such as was never seen in any other, never wearying in repelling them nor taking respite from the struggle against them."" Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly sent for help from Nur ad-Din and Saif-ad Din Ghazi, whose power he did not wish to see extend as far south as Damascus, and the crusaders besieged the city for only four days before withdrawing. It is possible that Mu'in ad-Din had bribed the crusaders to leave before Nur ad-Din arrived. After this success, the three emirs besieged the castle of Araima in the County of Tripoli, but Mu'in ad-Din was forced to acknowledge Nur ad-Din as his overlord."
"In 1149 Mu'in ad-Din led raids against crusader territory, in response to their raids against the territory of Damascus which they continued to make after the failure of their siege. He agreed to a two-year truce with King Baldwin III, and then joined with Nur ad-Din against the Principality of Antioch. Mu’in ad-Din patrolled the Hauran with his army while Nur ad-Din defeated Antioch at the Battle of Inab that year, in which Prince Raymond was killed."
"After returning to Damascus in July 1149, Mu'in ad-Din ""ate a hearty meal, as was his usual custom, and was seized thereafter by a loosening of the bowels...From this resulted in the disease known as dysentery..."" The emir died on August 28 and was buried in the university he had established in the city. As he had been acting as regent for Mujir ad-Din, the latter took his place as the rightful heir of Damascus. Mujir ad-Din was a weak ruler, however, and by 1154 Nur ad-Din was fully in control of the city and all of Syria."
"Mu'in ad-Din had three daughters, who married Nur ad-Din, Mujir ad-Din, and a soldier named Margar respectively. In addition to Ibn al-Qalanisi's favourable depiction of him, the Christian chronicler William of Tyre also speaks very highly of Mu'in ad-Din: he showed ""sincere fidelity"" in his negotiations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was ""a man of much wisdom and a lover of our people."" William of Tyre rendered his names in Latin as ""Meheneddin"" for Mu'in ad-Din and ""Anardus"" for Unur."

"A member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father. Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated."
"Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman. When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the Defenders, joining them against a villain named Hotspur."
"She was with the Defenders, christened the ""New Defenders,"" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them. With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second Star-Thief. She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team, and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone."
"The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans."
"Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 ""Atlantis Attacks"" crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his ""Seven Brides of Set."" Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers."
"Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis."
Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.
"Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the ""Homo mermanus"", but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary ""Homo mermanus"", though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean."
"She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water."
"She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8"" dagger as additional weaponry."
Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry.
= = = Great Hinckley Fire = = =
"The Great Hinckley Fire was a conflagration in the pine forests of the U.S. state of Minnesota in September 1894, which burned an area of at least (perhaps more than ), including the town of Hinckley. The official death count was 418; the actual number of fatalities was likely higher."
"After a two-month summer drought, combined with very high temperatures, several small fires started in the pine forests of Pine County, Minnesota. The fires' spread apparently was due to the then-common method of lumber harvesting, wherein trees were stripped of their branches in place; these branches littered the ground with flammable debris. Also contributing was a temperature inversion that trapped the gases from the fires. The scattered blazes united into a firestorm. The temperature rose to at least . Barrels of nails melted into one mass, and in the yards of the Eastern Minnesota Railroad, the wheels of the cars fused with the rails. Some residents escaped by climbing into wells, ponds, or the Grindstone River. Others clambered aboard two crowded trains that pulled out of the threatened town minutes ahead of the fire."
"James Root, an engineer on a train heading south from Duluth, rescued nearly 300 people by backing up a train nearly five miles to Skunk Lake, where the passengers escaped the fire. William Best was an engineer on a train sent specifically to evacuate people."
According to the Hinckley Fire Museum:
"Because of the dryness of the summer, fires were common in the woods, along railroad tracks and in logging camps where loggers would set fire to their slash to clean up the area before moving on. Some loggers, of course left their debris behind, giving any fire more fuel on which to grow. Saturday, September 1st, 1894 began as another oppressively hot day with fires surrounding the towns and two major fires that were burning about five miles (8 km) to the south. To add to the problem, the temperature inversion that day added to the heat, smoke and gases being held down by the huge layer of cool air above. The two fires managed to join together to make one large fire with flames that licked through the inversion finding the cool air above. That air came rushing down into the fires to create a vortex or tornado of flames which then began to move quickly and grew larger and larger turning into a fierce firestorm. The fire first destroyed the towns of Mission Creek and Brook Park before coming into the town of Hinckley. When it was over the Firestorm had completely destroyed six towns, and over lay black and smoldering. The firestorm was so devastating that it lasted only four hours but destroyed everything in its path."
"The fire destroyed the town of Hinckley (which at the time had a population of over 1,400) as well as the smaller nearby settlements of Mission Creek, Brook Park, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama."
The exact number of fatalities is difficult to determine. The official coroner's report counted 413 dead while the fire's official monument notes 418. An unknown number of Native Americans and backcountry dwellers were also killed in the fire; bodies continued to be found years later. Along with the 1918 Cloquet Fire (where 453 were killed) it is one of the deadliest in Minnesota history.
"Today, a section of the Willard Munger State Trail, from Hinckley to Barnum, is a memorial to the fire and the devastation it caused. In the town of Hinckley, on Highway 61, the Hinckley Fire Museum is located in the former Northern Pacific Railway depot. It is located a few feet north of the former depot, which burned down in the fire. It is open from May 1 until the end of October."
Lutheran Memorial Cemetery in Hinckley has a historical marker and granite obelisk as a memorial to those who perished in the fire. 248 residents of Hinckley perished in the fire and are buried in a mass grave at this cemetery. Some are unidentified.
"The Brook Park Cemetery on County Road 126, south of Minnesota State Highway 23, has an historical marker plaque and a memorial to the 23 fire victims of Brook Park, with a tall obelisk on top of a granite marker."
"Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett, the Union soldier who killed John Wilkes Booth after Booth's assassination of Abraham Lincoln, is presumed to have died in the fire. His last known residence is believed to have been a forest settlement near Hinckley, and a ""Thomas Corbett"" is listed as one of the dead or missing. Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett may not have died in the fire. Thomas Gilbert Corbitt lived in the Town of Thurston, in Steuben County, NY. He was a Civil War veteran in the 50th NY Engineers, Co. E. In late September and early October of 1894, Steuben County newspapers reported that Thomas Corbitt, until recently a resident of Thurston, was burned to death, along with his property, in the great fire at Hinckley, Minn."

"More than 420 feature-length film versions of Shakespeare's plays have been produced since the early 20th century, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever. Some of the film adaptations, especially Hollywood movies marketed to teenage audiences, use his plots rather than his dialogue, while others are simply filmed versions of his plays."
"For centuries there had been an accepted style of how Shakespeare was to be performed which was erroneously labeled ""Elizabethan"" but actually reflected a trend of design from a period shortly after Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare's performances were originally performed in contemporary dress. Actors were costumed in clothes that they might wear off the stage. This continued into the 18th century, the Georgian period, where costumes were the current fashionable dress. It was not until centuries after his death, primarily the 19th Century, that productions started looking back and tried to be ""authentic"" to a Shakespearean style. The Victorian era had a fascination with historical accuracy and this was adapted to the stage in order to appeal to the educated middle class. Charles Kean was particularly interested in historical context and spent many hours researching historical dress and setting for his productions. This faux-Shakespearean style was fixed until the 20th century. As of the twenty-first century, there are very few productions of Shakespeare, both on stage and on film, which are still performed in ""authentic"" period dress, while as late as 1990, virtually every true film version of a Shakespeare play was performed in correct period costume. The first film in English to break this pattern was 1995's ""Richard III"" which updated the setting to the 1930s but changed none of Shakespeare's dialogue."

"Sailing from San Diego 6 January 1942, ""Kaskaskia"" commenced fueling operations en route before arriving Pago Pago 20 January. For the next six months she operated out of Nom-a refueling the ships engaged in the violent struggle to stem the Japanese advance. The oiler arrived Kodiak, Alaska, 3 July with a cargo of oil and fuel to be used in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She returned to Wilmington, California, loaded oil and aviation gasoline and continued oil runs to Alaskan ports until she steamed to Nouméa late in March 1943. ""Kaskaskia"" supplied many ships, increasing the mobility of the fleet during the successful campaigns in the South Pacific."
"""Kaskaskia"" returned to San Pedro 28 July for repairs before resuming her duties at Pearl Harbor 21 September. She transported oil between California and Hawaii until she sailed 25 November to support the Gilbert Islands campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 December, the oiler resumed her cruises between San Pedro and Hawaii."
"As the Navy pushed relentlessly toward Japan, ""Kaskaskia"" departed Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 to support operations in the Marshall Islands. After the Navy had captured the Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, ""Kaskaskia"" supported carrier task forces during their devastating raids on Truk, the Marianas Islands, and Palau Islands in February and March."
"The oiler continued fueling operations in the Marshall Islands area until she cleared Majuro 6 June to fuel destroyers and destroyer escorts in the invasion of Saipan. Throughout June and July ""Kaskaskia"" remained on hand, assisting the fleet to take Saipee, Guam, and Tinian – important supply areas in the future campaign for the Philippines."
"As the Navy fought toward the Philippines, Admiral Nimitz decided to take the Palau Islands as a staging area for aircraft and ships during the invasion of Leyte. ""Kaskaskia"" departed Manus on 4 September with a task group bound for an assault on Peleliu. She operated in the Palau area until returning Manus 8 October. Her stay was a brief one, however, as she sailed 10 October for Leyte. Prior to the actual landings, she fueled units of the fleet, continuing this vital duty until a beachhead had been established. The oiler returned Ulithi 23 October and made another fueling run to the Philippine area early in November."
"After an overhaul at San Diego December 1944 through February 1945, ""Kaskaskia"" arrived Kwajalein 11 March to service the fleet. The oiler cleared Ulithi 30 March for the fueling area off Okinawa, the last major step before the Japanese homeland itself. Once again the oilers, the unsung heroes of the war, stood by refueling the many ships engaged in the irresistible assault from the sea on Okinawa."
"""Kaskaskia"" was relieved of fueling duties off Okinawa, only to be summoned for another important service. She departed Ulithi 3 July to refuel units of the carrier task forces, launching raids on the Japanese Islands of Honshū and Hokkaidō. When the Japanese surrendered, ""Kaskaskia"" steamed into Tokyo Bay 10 September with ships of the Occupation Forces. She continued refueling operations in Japan, China, and Formosa for an entire year before arriving San Pedro 28 September 1946."
"Between 1947 and 1950 she ferried oil and aviation gasoline from the West Coast to the Far East and naval bases in the mid-Pacific. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea, the United States accepted the challenge and ordered its forces to defend the embattled peninsula. ""Kaskaskia"" cleared San Diego 16 September to operate out of Sasebo. During October she entered the heavily mined waters off Wonsan, fueling ships blockading and bombarding that key port."
"During December she arrived off Hungnam to service ships engaged in evacuation operations in that area. Throughout the harsh winter months, ""Kaskaskia"" continued vital fueling missions between Japan and Korea. During the United Nations counteroffensive in the spring of 1951, she also stood by for fueling operations. The oiler returned to Long Beach, California, 27 August for overhaul and operations along the Pacific Coast."
"She sailed for the second Korean tour January 1952, arriving Sasebo on 22 January to refuel the ships engaged in the Korean War. In addition to services in Korea, she also supplied units in Japan, Okinawa and Formosa before returning Long Beach 31 July. Overhaul and training preceded her third Korean deployment from 27 December to July 1953. On this tour she supported ships engaged in fire support operations. Returning home 17 August, ""Kaskaskia"" underwent overhaul; she then sailed again for the Far East 4 January 1954, operated out of Sasebo and returning San Francisco 12 October. Following coastal operations, the oiler was placed out of commission, in reserve, 8 April 1955."
"""Kaskaskia"" was transferred to MSTS 8 January 1957, and operated in that capacity with a Navy crew until 21 October 1957 when she decommissioned and was turned over to the Maritime Administration 10 December. ""Kaskaskia"" was struck from the Navy List 2 January 1959."
"The Berlin Crisis of 1961 necessitated the reactivation of ships and ""Kaskaskia"" was reinstated 8 September. Following overhaul and alterations she recommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, 6 December, Captain John D. Howell in command. After shakedown operations in the Caribbean, the oiler arrived Mayport, Florida, 1 May 1962. Throughout the summer she engaged in exercises off the Florida Coast, and sailed to the Azores to participate in Project Mercury, manned orbital flights. She was in company with during the latter's recovery of Astronaut Walter Schirra 3 October, demonstrating the large role of the Navy in space operations."
"""Kaskaskia"" return to Mayport 22 October and two days later sailed to participate in the Cuban blockade. President John F. Kennedy ordered the blockade when the Soviet Union tried to plant offensive missiles only from the United States. The naval pressure persuaded the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles, easing the crisis. The oiler returned to operations out of Mayport 21 November."
"She cleared Mayport 5 February 1963, for a six-month Mediterranean cruise to refuel ships of the US 6th Fleet, then resumed refueling exercises off Florida for the rest of the year. During 1964 ""Kaskaskia"" engaged in fueling operations and exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean, constantly seeking improved methods to increase the mobility of the Fleet."
"On 6 January 1965, ""Kaskaskia"" sailed for another 6th Fleet deployment. While she was operating in the Mediterranean, her crew worked day and night delivering over 19,000,000 gallons of fuel to 169 ships. ""Kaskaskia"" returned to Mayport, 7 June 1965. She operated primarily along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. Highlights of this period were service to ships patrolling off the coast of riot-torn Santo Domingo in the summer of 1965, and participation in the recovery team for an unmanned Apollo Program space flight in February 1966."
"""Kaskaskia"" was decommissioned for the final time in December 1969 and sold for scrap in September 1970."
"""Kaskaskia"", received nine battle stars for World War II and seven stars for Korean War service."
"His ESPN debut was a second-round knockout of Sergio Rios on Wednesday Night Fights. Williams made his HBO debut against then-undefeated Walter Matthysse, winning by a tenth-round technical knockout. That was followed by a victory over former junior welterweight world champion Sharmba Mitchell. He knocked Mitchell down three times en route to a fourth-round TKO."
"Williams became the mandatory challenger for WBO Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito. The match took place July 14, 2007, in Carson, California, at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning a unanimous decision in which turned out to be a close fight where Williams' seemingly stronger finish seemed to seal him the decision victory in the eyes of boxing experts and fans alike."
"Williams fought Carlos Quintana on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams lost to Quintana by decision in what many considered a minor upset."
"Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut on June 7, 2008 for the WBO Welterweight title, at Williams' request. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again."
Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight Kelly Pavlik for the WBC Middleweight title but instead Pavlik himself decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight Bernard Hopkins. Williams fought Andy Kolle on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first-round knockout in 1:37 seconds.
"After failing to secure another meaningful contest at welterweight, Williams vacated his WBO welterweight title in order to fight Verno Phillips for the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"On November 29, 2008, Williams defeated Phillips by way of TKO after 8 rounds after the Doctor stopped the fight. In doing so he secured the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"Williams fought Winky Wright on April 11, 2009, in a 12-round middleweight bout featured on HBO. Williams defeated Wright in a unanimous decision which was not close on the scorecards – two of the three judges gave Williams all but one round while the third scored all 12 rounds for Williams."
"Williams was then preparing to fight Middleweight Champion Kelly Pavlik in a bout scheduled to take place on October 3, 2009 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The bout was postponed when it was discovered Pavlik had a staph infection in his knuckle and had been rescheduled for December 5. However, the bout was called off for a second time six weeks prior to the fight because Pavlik's infection had not completely healed."
"On December 5, 2009 Paul Williams fought Sergio Martínez in a war of a twelve-round main event. In the first round Martinez was knocked down due to bad balance and a grazing left hand that landed just below the ear. In the final seconds of the 1st round though Martinez scored a knockdown of his own over Williams. The next two rounds were heavily in Martinez's favor as he hit Williams with barrages of counter punches. After Martinez was seemingly won the first 3 rounds, rounds 4-7 showed Williams coming back effectively landing hard lefts to the head of Martinez. In rounds 8-10 Martinez again confused Williams with using different varieties of punches, including straight lead lefts to the body followed by right hooks to the head and straight lefts to the face. The final 2 rounds showed much fatigue in Martinez and Williams but both warriors fought through to the end, although Williams seemed to win both of the last 2 rounds by being the far more active boxer (while the punching exchanges were very closely contested during those final 2 rounds as well), which would ultimately prove to be the difference and as a result of having far superior activity during those final 2 rounds, Williams won a close majority decision over Martinez. The judges scored the fight 114-114, 115-113 for Williams and 119-110 for Williams, thus making Williams emerge as the majority decision winner."
"After his close win over Sergio Martínez, Paul Williams moved on to face Puerto Rican prospect Kermit Cintrón. The two met on May 8, 2010 Live on Saturday Night HBO Boxing. In the fourth round, Kermit Cintron fell out of the ring unintentionally and was not allowed to continue fighting due to hitting the arena floor. Williams was ahead on two of the three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage and was declared the winner by split technical decision. Cintron, who believed he should have been ahead on the scorecards, filed a complaint to have the ruling changed to a no-contest, claiming he was not given the five-minute recovery time allowed under California rules."
"A highly anticipated rematch with Sergio Martinez eventually materialized at Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey on November 20, 2010. Upon the Williams camp's insistence, the fight was contested at the catchweight limit of 158 pounds instead of the middleweight limit of 160, with Martinez's WBC Middleweight title on the line. The fight was billed as a potential ""fight-of-the-year,"" however the fight ended abruptly and dramatically when Sergio Martinez delivered a knockout blow with 2:02 left in the 2nd round. The punch was a short left cross that caught Williams right on the chin as he attempted to deliver a left-hand of his own. Williams' right hand was at his waist when the punch landed, rendering Paul Williams unconscious upon contact."
"On July 9, 2011, Paul Williams fought in a light middleweight contest in Atlantic City against former Cuban amateur sensation Erislandy Lara. Throughout the fight, Lara repeatedly hit Williams with hard left hands and appeared to have won the fight convincingly in the eyes of the HBO crew and those sitting at ringside. However, the judges awarded Williams with a narrow majority decision, a highly controversial verdict that ultimately led to the suspension of the three judges by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board."
"On May 27, 2012, Williams was severely injured when he crashed his motorcycle in Georgia. He swerved to avoid hitting a car while traveling at about 75 mph on the motorcycle and was launched sixty feet. Witnesses say he landed on his head and his body ""folded like a suitcase."" The accident left him with a part of his spinal cord severely bruised, paralyzing him from the waist down. Since it was bruised and not severed, it gives him a chance to regain sensation. The doctors told Williams the swelling could go down in a year or two, potentially giving him a chance of walking again. The accident came as Williams was preparing for his PPV main event against Canelo Alvarez on September 15. ""I'm just chilling in a wheelchair because I got tired of walking,"" Williams said in an interview with Jim Gray on ""Showtime Championship Boxing"" on the day he was supposed to fight. ""Whether I am walking or not walking, my game ain't over until the Lord takes my life."""

"Bride's Hill, known also as Sunnybrook, is a historic house near Wheeler, Alabama. It is one of the state's earliest surviving and most significant, examples of the Tidewater-type cottage. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on April 16, 1985 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1986."
"A member of the Dandridge family, cousins of America's first First Lady (Martha Washington), is believed to have built Bride's Hill. Its deep cellar, lighted by oblong ground-level windows, houses a basement kitchen-dining room. On the main floor a broad central hall, with a graceful reverse-flight stairway rising to the low half-story above, separates two large rooms. Allegedly a separate brick kitchen structure once stood to the rear. When absorbed into the vast Joseph Wheeler estate in 1907, the house and surrounding farm became known as Sunnybrook. Located in rural Lawrence County, the house has been unoccupied since the 1980s and is in a state of disrepair."
"Brought to the early Alabama plantation frontier by settlers from the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of Virginia, this vernacular house-type is usually a story-and-a-half in height, and characterized by prominent end chimneys flanking a steeply pitched roof often pierced by dormer windows."

"A third ""Yorga"" film, which would have featured a broken Count Yorga living in Los Angeles's sewers and creating an army of undead street people, never materialised."
"Though Count Yorga is referred to as ""the Deathmaster"" in publicity for this film, a later film called ""The Deathmaster"", also starring Robert Quarry as a vampire, has no relation to the Count Yorga series."
The film was released theatrically in the US by American International Pictures in 1971.
"The film was released on VHS home video (full screen format) in 1993 by Orion Home Video, which once held home video distribution rights to many titles in the American International Pictures catalog."
"The film was given a second VHS release by MGM Home Entertainment in September 2000. It later was released on DVD by MGM in 2005 as part of its Midnite Movies series. The disc was a double-feature release, pairing the film with ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"When CBS ran the movie in the 1970s on its ""Friday Night Late Movie"", the on-screen title was ""Yorga Returns""."
"Howard Thompson of ""The New York Times"" panned the film as ""a dull, amateurish vampire brew."" ""Variety"" called it ""a solid follow-up"" to the original and ""a handsome-looking film which rings the bell on both the shocker and satirical level."" Gene Siskel of the ""Chicago Tribune"" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it ""extremely frightening"" and adding, ""Persons familiar with the original will find the sequel better photographed, better acted and containing more mayhem a minute."" Kevin Thomas of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote, ""Those who saw 'Count Yorga' will be disappointed. Those who only see 'The Return' will wonder what all the fuss was about in regard to the original. In the first film comedy gave way to terror; in this self-conscious sequel the two elements tend to cancel each other out. The result is a pretty silly show."" David Pirie of ""The Monthly Film Bulletin"" wrote that Count Yorga had been resurrected ""with considerably more enterprise and panache than before."" He praised the acting as being ""of a generally high standard"" and the castle set as ""skilfully utilised to give the impression of a labyrinth of Borgesian proportions,"" though he criticized ""a totally unnecessary and feeble attempt to make the Count into a sympathetic figure through such lines as, 'The most fragile emotion ever known has entered my breast.'"""
= = = Nuoli-class fast gunboat = = =
"The Nuoli class motor gunboats () was a series of thirteen fast attack craft (gun) of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1961 by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, and modernized in 1979. The Nuoli motor gunboats played a very important role in naval training and were in service to early 90s."
"There are two distinctive versions, 1-10 and 11-13. The former could be distinguished by having a higher superstructure. All were equipped with three Soviet-made V-12 diesel engines. There was no separate cruise engine, except from a small auxiliary engine that produced electricity. The vessels were first equipped with large screws, but later changed to smaller, albeit equally effective screws, manufactured by Finnscrew."
"The Nuoli-class was planned to be armed with electrically controlled Bofors 40/70-system, but limitations of the auxiliary engine prevented this. For a brief time, Madsen 20/60 were replaced with Breda 12.7 mm heavy machine-gun which came from WW II-period Fiat G50-fighters; the change back to Madsen was done in 1981."
"Finland was forbidden to have torpedo boats after World War II, but the Nuoli class could quickly be converted into such, if need arose. in 1982 Nuoli-6 was transferred and ferried to Obbnäs torpedo test station to be used as test vessel for a new Finnish-origin torpedo system, which failed. The trip to Obbnäs was made in heavy weather - the waves were so hard that they damaged the wooden support structure of the bow. Nuoli-6 was driven aground in Obbnäs 1983 (summer/autumn) and was stricken."
"As service vessel these boats gave one a true feeling of being a sailor. Constructed of wood, they leaked ""a bit"" an so the atmosphere was rather moist. Living quarters were limited - even those of the commanding officer. There was no privacy at all - on Nuoli one was true member of the crew."
"The vessels are today spread all over Finland, and one is in Germany (Nuoli 12). Nuoli 8 is preserved at the Turku marine museum ""Forum Marinum""."
= = = 1991 Football League Cup Final = = =
The 1991 Football League Cup Final was a football match played on 21 April 1991 between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday. It was the first of two years that the competition was sponsored by Rumbelows.
"Despite the previous season's FA Cup winners, Manchester United, being favourites to lift the trophy, Second Division side Sheffield Wednesday won the match 1–0, the winning goal scored by John Sheridan, giving the Owls their first League Cup title in a season when they also won promotion back to the top flight. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable League Cup finals of all time."
The trophy was presented to Wednesday skipper Nigel Pearson by Rumbelows employee of the year Tracy Bateman. Pearson was also named man of the match.
"The Football League Cup is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and The Football League. It is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. As clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League, both teams entered the competition in the second round."
"Manchester United's second-round tie saw them drawn against Fourth Division Halifax Town; they won the first leg at The Shay 3–1, with goals from Clayton Blackmore, Brian McClair and Neil Webb, before Viv Anderson and Steve Bruce gave them a 2–1 win at Old Trafford and a 5–2 aggregate victory. Anderson, who was by now rarely used in the United first team, went on to be sold to Sheffield Wednesday three months later, his appearance for United in the early stages of the competition making him ineligible for Wednesday's matches and denying him the chance to add to the two League Cup medals he had won with Nottingham Forest and a later medal in the competition won with Arsenal."
"They were then drawn against rivals and reigning First Division champions Liverpool in the third round, where Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe joined Bruce on the score sheet in a 3–1 home win. In the fourth round, a 19-year-old Sharpe scored a hat-trick in addition to goals from Blackmore, Hughes and Danny Wallace to give United a 6–2 away win over Arsenal, who would go on to win the First Division title that season, just over a month after the two teams had been involved in a mass brawl during a 1–0 Arsenal win at Old Trafford that saw both teams deducted points."
"In the fifth round, United were held to a 1–1 draw away to Southampton, Hughes scoring their only goal; Hughes was again the only United player on the score sheet in the replay a week later, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 win that put them into the semi-finals. Southampton striker Alan Shearer, who within months was reported to be transfer target for Manchester United, scoring all of Southampton's goals during the two cup clashes with United."
"Goals from McClair and Sharpe gave United a 2–1 win in the first leg of the semi-final at home to Leeds United, and Sharpe scored again in the second leg – his sixth League Cup goal of the season – as United won 1–0, and 3–1 on aggregate, to put them into their second League Cup final."
"Sheffield Wednesday, whose last major honour had been the FA Cup in 1935, were fresh from relegation to the Second Division when they were drawn against Third Division Brentford in the second round, winning 2–1 in each of the two legs to put them into the third round. There they met fellow Second Division side Swindon Town, who held them to a goalless draw at Hillsborough, before succumbing to a 1–0 defeat at the County Ground in the replay a week later. Wednesday required another replay in the fourth round, after they played out another draw at home to Derby County, but beat them 2–1 at the Baseball Ground two weeks later."
"The quarter-final saw Wednesday drawn away to Coventry City, where a 1-0 victory for Wednesday ended any hopes that Coventry's new player-manager Terry Butcher might have had of beginning his managerial career with silverware. Their semi-final opponents were drawn against Chelsea. The first leg of the semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge, where goals from Peter Shirtliff and David Hirst gave them a 2–0 win, before Nigel Pearson, Danny Wilson and Paul Williams gave them a 3–1 win in the second leg at Hillsborough to put them into the final, 5–1 on aggregate. It was Wednesday's first Wembley cup final in 25 years."
"The broadcast of this League Cup final caused controversy in Yorkshire, where instead of showing the post-match celebrations (as London Weekend Television did), Yorkshire Television decided to cut the broadcast short to show a programme titled ""War of the Monster Trucks"". People from Sheffield often cite this event as a demonstration of the station's bias towards West Yorkshire, Leeds and above all Leeds United. The incident inspired the name of the Sheffield Wednesday fanzine ""War of the Monster Trucks""."

"The Runaway in Oz is an Oz book by long-time Oz illustrator John R. Neill. It was written originally during 1943 and was meant to be the thirty-seventh book in the Oz series. However, Neill died before he could edit or illustrate the book. Oz publisher Reilly & Lee decided not to publish the book due to shortages caused by World War II. The text remained a possession of Neill's family."
"In 1995, the book was published by Oz specialty house Books of Wonder with illustrations by Eric Shanower. Shanower also edited and expanded Neill's text. Another version exists, printed privately, with different editing by Fred M. Meyer, longtime Secretary of The International Wizard of Oz Club."
"On the eve of an important ceremony in the Emerald City, Scraps the Patchwork Girl has been making more of a nuisance of herself than usual. After confrontations with Jellia Jamb and Jenny Jump, Scraps decides to run away on her spoolicle (a bicycle made of thread spools). She visits Jinjur's Munchkin Country farm; but Jinjur wants to put Scraps to work, so Scraps leaves quickly."
"At Prof. Wogglebug's Royal Athletic College, Scraps falls in with a 12-year-old prodigy named Alexample. They marvel at the air castle the Professor has dreamed into existence for his coming vacation, as it hovers above the college. Through unfortunate clumsiness, Scraps knocks the mooring line loose and the air castle floats away, with Alexample hanging onto the tethering rope. Scraps flees from the pursuit of the irate Wogglebug."
"Scraps meets a Repairman who magically fixes the damage and staining she's endured in her recent actions. The exasperated Scraps longs to run away from Oz entirely, but doesn't know how to cross the Deadly Desert. The Repairman informs her of a Weather Witch who lives on the highest mountain in Oz; she makes weather for the entire Earth from her windmill there. Scraps decides to get the Weather Witch to blow her across the Desert with wind, and sets out for the mountain."
"On the way, Scraps meets Popla, ""the one and only power plant...the most powerful plant in the world."" (Popla looks like a large shrub, with the face of a beautiful young woman.) Popla longs for release from her bleak and stationary existence, and eagerly transfers herself into a flowerpot to join with Scraps; Popla's strength and resourcefulness prove to be important advantages in their coming adventures. Despite tempestuous winds, the two intrepid travelers reach the top of the mountain. Fanny the Weather Witch agrees to blast them across the Deadly Desert; but additional clumsiness gets them stuck on one of the windmill's blades, which hurls them high into the atmosphere."
"Meanwhile, Prof. Wogglebug stomps toward the Emerald City to complain about Scraps to the Wizard. He encounters Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who have set out in search for the missing Scraps. The Wogglebug decides to join up with them, as the most direct approach to recovering his air castle. (The later chapters of the book alternate between the two plots: the runaway Scraps and her companions, and the searchers pursuing her.)"
"Scraps and Popla land on a friendly cloud, who takes them to a nearby star. The star is a kind of semi-mechanical conveyance, commanded by Captain Batt, who is built of wires and electric components. Predictably, Scraps gets into a fight with him; she punches him in his button nose, which proves to be his on-off button. With Captain Batt shut down, they meet the Twinkler, the star's maintenance man (he looks like Cap'n Bill). Popla tries piloting the star — and crashes into the missing air castle. They find Alexample there, and endure a few peaceful days in its palatial environs. They get to know the inhabitants of the upper air, who include sky fairies and air sprites, and cloud sheep herded by cloud-pushers and sky-sweepers. Scraps and company also repel an attack from sky pirates."
"Things go badly for the searchers below; they are caught in a storm, in which Jack loses his pumpkin head. Jenny and the Professor have to lead or drag his headless stick-body along with them. They wander into an enchanted orchard, where they confront an army of rebellious quinces. By this time, the week of the Wogglebug's planned vacation has expired, and the air castle's time is up: it melts, cracks, dissolves, shatters, and otherwise falls apart around its occupants. They come tumbling down upon the enchanted orchard, and the search party, and the quince army. In a final confrontation, the quince soldiers commit mass suicide by shooting their sooty stems at Scraps. She is so blackened by the soot that she tries to hide from the world."
"The others convince Scraps to return to the Emerald City, where she can be magically repaired. Scraps agrees, but she hides herself under a sheet as she walks through the city streets (like Ojo in ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz""); she causes a panic when she is mistaken for a ghost. Yet Ozma has no trouble in restoring Scraps to normal (if that term applies) with her Magic Belt. Popla and Alexample are welcomed into the ever-growing circle of Ozma's followers."
"In the best Baum tradition, puns come thick and fast throughout ""The Runaway in Oz"". In Chapter 8, ""The Professor Sets Out,"" the reader is informed of the enlarged bug's feelings: ""But though he was in an unsettled state of mind, he was not crushed."" Two pages later, he threatens to become ""hopping mad."" Jenny tells the professor that the Wizard is busy ""ridding the country of dumb little kings and their little kingdumbs."" These three pages can stand as representative of the whole."

Two years later, the Uesugi attacked and burned Kamakura, which was a major loss to the Hōjō symbolically, because the earlier Hōjō clan from which they took their name fell in the siege of Kamakura in 1333."
"The Uesugi attacked again in 1535, when Ujitsuna was away fighting the Takeda; however, Ujitsuna returned and defeated Uesugi Tomooki, reclaiming his lands. When Uesugi Tomooki died two years later, Ujitsuna took the opportunity to seize Kawagoe Castle, and secure his control of the Kantō."
"In 1526, Hojo Ujitsuna was defeated by Takeda Nobutora in the Battle of Nashinokidaira."
"Ujitsuna then went on to win the battle of Kōnodai in 1538, securing Shimōsa Province for the Hōjō."
In 1539 he defeated the Koga Kubo Yoshiaki and gained control of Awa.
"Over the next several years before his death in 1541, Ujitsuna oversaw the rebuilding of Kamakura, making it a symbol of the growing power of the Hōjō, along with Odawara and Edo. He was succeeded as head of the Hōjō clan and lord of Odawara by his son Hōjō Ujiyasu."

"Andromeda Attumasen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is an Atlantean of Marvel's shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. She is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma"
"Andromeda was introduced in ""The Defenders"" #143 (March 1985) and added to the titular supergroup's lineup just a few issues later. Writer Peter B. Gillis later revealed, ""My long-term plan was to populate the Defenders with my own crew of characters, characters who nonetheless had ties to interesting parts of the Marvel Universe. Andromeda, while not the Sub-Mariner, gave me a connection to Atlantis."" However, Andromeda would be the last character Gillis added to the Defenders, since shortly after her debut he was told that the series was being cancelled."
"Toward the end of the war, Rupe resolved to get into the entertainment industry. After losing money he had invested in a small record company, he spent $200 on what were called ""race records"" at the time to systematically analyze them and determine the formula for records that would sell. He decided that the secret lay in a big band sound with a churchy feel. He found the recording talent he needed in the many after-hours clubs in the Watts district. He and Ben Siegert first started Juke Box Records in 1944 and after a few hits, he broke with his partners and started a new company, Specialty Records. The label soon thrived with Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield, and Jimmy Liggins, along with a very successful gospel catalog. The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert ""Bumps"" Blackwell, and J. W. Alexander. Johnny Vincent was a sales representative for the company."
"Rupe had a love of gospel music, and in 1947 he began recording gospel quartets such as the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Pilgrim Travelers, Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates and Sister Wynona Carr. His taste for gospel carried over into secular music and influenced his choice of artists to record, such as Guitar Slim, Don and Dewey, Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, and Little Richard. It led him to value feeling over technique in the recording studio. Concerns about religious objections to the secularization of gospel music, combined with a contract dispute, resulted in his decision not to put out a pop record with gospel singer Sam Cooke. He recorded but ultimately chose not to release two songs that later became big hits, ""You Send Me"" and ""Summertime""."
"In 1952, Rupe first traveled to New Orleans because of his attraction to the gospel sound of Fats Domino who played piano in the band of Dave Bartholomew, a former trumpeter with Duke Ellington. It was on this trip that he auditioned and then recorded Lloyd Price."
"Rupe obtained his most successful artist when Little Richard, then a little-known recording artist, followed Lloyd Price's suggestion and sent Rupe a demo record. Art sent Blackwell to New Orleans to do a recording session. During a recording break Little Richard sang an obscene song while playing the piano. Blackwell sensed that it was a hit, but after the lyrics had been cleaned up, there was no time to teach the song to a piano player. So Little Richard both played and sang the only song to emerge from that first session, done in just three takes, ""Tutti Frutti"", one of the most significant rock and roll records ever made. Rupe also recorded Guitar Slim, with a young Ray Charles on piano. In addition, Specialty issued some of wildest R&B records, such as ""Cherokee Dance"", by Froggy Landers; ""(Everytime I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone"", by Roy Montrell; ""Drunk"" by Jimmy Liggins; and the rock & roll ""Moose on the Loose"", by Roddy Jackson."
"When asked why Specialty was so successful, Rupe credited his own ability to produce rather than his business skills. In the early 1960s, he stopped producing records but remained active in the music business as a publisher. He returned during the fifties revival period in the late 1960s but only to reissue landmark recordings of the R&B era. Rupe sold Specialty to Fantasy Records in 1991. However, it is worth noting that the contracts that were given to the artists to sign left Rupe and others at the label with full ownership and publishing rights of the music. Richard signed a contract with Specialty Records in 1955. He reportedly gave the label full ownership of all the music he recorded with them in return for 50% of the royalties earned. In his authorized biography, he states that he sold his publishing rights to “Tutti Frutti” for $50, leaving him with a small half-cent royalty rate per record sold. In 1959, Little Richard left the label and filed a lawsuit claiming he never received his royalties. He settled for $11,000 and waived his rights to royalties from such hits as “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally”."
"During the 1960s and later, Rupe became increasingly involved in oil and gas investments. Success in this area allowed him to establish the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a philanthropy based in Santa Barbara."
He turned 100 in September 2017.
"In 2007, Rupe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame."
"On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Rupe will be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with former Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
"= = = Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South = = ="
"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South () is the full title of the English translation of the novel written by the French science-fiction author Jules Verne, and centers on the story of James Burbank, an antislavery northerner living near Jacksonville, Florida, and Texar, a pro-slavery southerner who holds a vendetta against Burbank. Originally published in France in 1887, the book received a tepid reaction upon its release in the United States, partly because of Verne's inexpertise regarding some details of the American Civil War, and has since fallen into obscurity compared to many of Verne's other works."
"Texar and Burbank are bitter enemies, Burbank's northern view of slavery as an evil being an unpopular stance with Texar and the rest of the community, deep in the Confederate States of America. On top of this disagreement, though, Texar is angry at Burbank for past legal troubles Burbank has brought upon Texar, and, despite Texar inventing a perfect alibi that allows him to escape conviction, Texar feels the need for vengeance and eventually becomes a prominent and powerful member of the Jacksonville community. Using this newfound power, Texar turns the townsfolk against Burbank and leads a mob that destroys the Burbank plantation, known as Camdless Bay. Burbank's daughter Dy and caretaker Zermah are both kidnapped by a man claiming to be Texar and are purportedly taken to a place in the Everglades called Carneral Island. En route, and after enlisting the help of the United States Navy, they find a separate group searching for Texar in response to crimes that apparently happened in the same time as the ones at Camdless Bay but in a distant location. This opens up the realization that there is one real Texar and one who is not, and the search continues now, not only for Dy and Zermah, but for the answer to this mystery."
"""Nord Contre Sud"", the original French title of the book, was first published in its fully illustrated edition in November, 1887, by J. Hetzel et Cie, Paris."
"In the first American (and first English) translation, ""Nord Contre Sud"" (North Against South) was relegated to a subtitle and the book's title was made ""Texar's Vengeance"", quickly re-translated as ""Texar's Revenge"". This edition was published by George Munro, New York (1887), a translation by Laura E. Kendall as part of the ""Seaside Library"". Since then, however, there have been more minor variations on the title, some editions referring to the title as ""The Texar's Revenge"", others omitting the title completely in favor of the more simple ""North Against South"". The most common and generally most accepted American version of the title is the full ""Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South"". There have also been a handful of editions that have split the book into two volumes, those being ""Burbank the Northerner"" and ""Texar the Southerner"", both of which are contained in most editions of the book. Various cheap editions were published in the U.S. for the next 20 years by W. L. Allison, Hurst, and others."
"The first fully illustrated edition in English was ""North against South"" published by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, London, December 1887. This is a different anonymous translation from the one published by George Munro. In 2007 the first fully illustrated edition of ""North against South"" in the U.S. was published by the Choptank Press of St. Michaels, Maryland as a Lulu Press book, a replica re-publication of the Sampson Low first edition."
"[In Jules Verne's] story of ""Texar""... a very thin streak of narrative is padded to almost unwieldy proportions by a quantity of remarkably inaccurate information about the rebellion. If anyone thought the game worth the candle it would be easy to point out the various comical inaccuracies in the historical part of the story... [quoted in T&M]"

"In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the French Alps and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location."
"Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a gang rape, a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of World War II; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor."
"Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children."
"Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children. Francard comes back for Judith and the film ends as the room is seen empty."

"Chintila (; 606 – 20 December 639) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 636. He succeeded Sisenand in a time of weakness and reigned until his death."
"He was elected and confirmed by a convention of bishops and nobles in accordance with the 75th canon of the Fourth Council of Toledo. With his election, nothing changed and instability reigned. He never solved the many problems that plagued his time in office and, as the chroniclers of the age report, this included rebellions in Septimania and Gallaecia. In the three years of his reign, he permitted the bishops wide authority and they acted as monarchs ""de facto"", if not ""de jure""."
"He dedicated his time to councils, the Fifth Council of Toledo in June 636 and the Sixth Council of Toledo in June 638. These meetings covered many topics and legislated many new regulations."
"The king had to be chosen from among the nobility; never a ""tonsurado"" (cleric), member of the servile classes (peasants), or foreigners. They dictated the penalties for insurrection and determined that property acquired justly by the king could not be confiscated by his successor. Finally, they outlawed non-Catholics within the frontiers of the kingdom, which resulted in many forced conversions."
Chintila died in 639 or 640 of natural causes and was followed by his son Tulga.
= = = List of Stargate Atlantis episodes = = =
"""Stargate Atlantis"" is a Canadian-American science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper as a spin off from its sister show, ""Stargate SG-1"". The series resumes the story of the ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"" episodes of ""SG-1"", where a military team led by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Major (now Lt. Colonel) Samantha Carter and the Jaffa Teal'c, use an ancient alien artifact called the Stargate to travel to different planets to explore and find new technology. The series pilot ""Rising"" takes place in the year 2004 after the events of ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"", when they finally find the lost city of the Ancients."
"""Stargate Atlantis"" premiered on July 16, 2004 on the channel Sci Fi Channel. The Sci Fi Channel would air all the five seasons made for the series. Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British and Canadian channels Sky One and The Movie Network aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. ""Stargate Atlantis""<nowiki>'</nowiki> finale episode premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The series finale was also the series' 100th episode. All five seasons of ""Stargate Atlantis"" are available on DVD. A direct-to-DVD film tentatively titled ""Stargate: Extinction"" was planned, but was later shelved."
"The cast of the first season consisted of Joe Flanigan starring as Maj. John Sheppard, David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay, Rachel Luttrell as Teyla Emmagan, Torri Higginson as Elizabeth Weir and Rainbow Sun Francks as First Lt. Aiden Ford. Aiden Ford was reduced to recurring character in season two and was replaced by Jason Momoa as the extraterrestrial human Ronon Dex in episode three of season two. Francks continued to have a recurring role in season 2, until his character's death (although this was not confirmed). After Torri Higginson's departure as a main character from ""Stargate Atlantis"" after Season 3, she was replaced by Amanda Tapping's Carter from the sister show. Paul McGillion, Robert Picardo and Jewel Staite were also main characters. McGillion became a main character in season two until season three as Carson Beckett, Picardo replaced Tapping as a main character as the new leader of the Atlantis expedition as Richard Woolsey for season five, and Staite portrayed Jennifer Keller as a main character in season five."

"Episodes in bold are continuous episodes, where the story spans over 2 or more episodes."
"The series picks up the story arc from ""Stargate SG-1""'s ""Lost City"", where people from all around the world come together to form an expedition and discover the wonders of Atlantis. Discovering that they have been cut off from Earth, they must fend for themselves, and discover a powerful new enemy bent on human subjugation."
"The story continues when the Daedalus arrives and renews the expedition's connection to Earth. This takes place alongside the Ori story arc in SG-1, and the Wraith become an even larger threat in the Pegasus Galaxy. But what they deal with in their second year might be more than they can handle, and Dr. Carson Beckett's retrovirus is more trouble than it's worth."
"This season concentrates on more character driven stories. Along with new insight on the characters, the expedition discovers a new threat, one that could be the precursor to the Replicators. Some important characters leave the series in this season, and the fate of Atlantis once again is in the hands of the humans from Earth."

= = = Quaker Oats Company = = =
"The Quaker Oats Company, known as Quaker, is an American food conglomerate based in Chicago. It has been owned by PepsiCo since 2001."
Quaker Oats was founded in 1901 by the merger of four oat mills:
"The company expanded into numerous areas, including other breakfast cereals and other food and drink products, and even into unrelated fields such as toys."
"Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant."
"During World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, which manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of total 280,800 ft² were built)."
"In 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois. This plant currently makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants."
"In 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company and spun it off in 1991."
"In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", obtaining in return a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for candy bars."
"In 1982 Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998."
"In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade."
"Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group."
"In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004)."
"In August 2001, Pepsico acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion dollars."
"The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as ""The Electric City"" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent–Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire."
"When PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the ""manufactured by"" address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility exports to the majority of Canada and limited portions of the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets."
"Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called ""Liberty Park"". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the ""oatmeal lots"". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a ""general foreclosure"" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant."
"In 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike."
"The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word ""Pure"" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn, the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker. Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the ""Quaker man"" as William Penn, and referred to him as ""standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats."""
"In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look. The man is now sometimes referred to as ""Larry"" by insiders at Quaker Oats."
"And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: ""Nothing is better for thee, than me""."
"The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo ""does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength."""
"The company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). ""The Straight Dope"" writes ""According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877."""
"Members of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation. In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a ""Quakerman"" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto. Later that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal."
"From 1946-1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ""Science Club"" and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997."
"In 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat, yet their packaging featured claims like ""heart healthy,"" ""wholesome,"" and ""smart choices made easy."""

All Strontians are born with the capacity for great strength and various superpowers, but can only use them when they are completely devoted to a purpose. Fearing a Strontian rebellion, the Shi'ar emperor ordered Kallark, among other Strontians, to kill the Strontian elders. Only Kallark was devoted enough to carry out the order, and the others were killed when their wavering commitment rendered them weak.

He later came looking for the X-Men to help him fight against the Phalanx; however, his aggressive arrival led him to blows with the X-Men's Cannonball, and while he was defeated by the young mutant, he managed to get the help of several X-Men in stopping the invasion. Some time later, on Lilandra's orders, Gladiator returns to Earth and attacks the X-Men's home, but later learns that Lilandra was possessed by Cassandra Nova and frees her."
"Liladra sends Gladiator to infiltrate the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, as a prisoner. He investigates rumors of a prisoner with the aid of Thanos and Star-Lord. The prisoner turns out to be an amnesiac Beyonder. Guided by the cosmic entity Living Tribunal, Gladiator fights the Champion of the Universe in an attempt to liberate the population of a planet the Champion had enslaved."
"At the request of Lilandra, Gladiator returns to Earth on a mission to capture the Uni-Power and bring it back for evaluation. After an encounter with the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four, Gladiator invites the Uni-Power to return to the Shi'ar Empire as their guest. Although the Uni-Power agrees, it is captured en route by Krosakis, an energy leeching warlord who forces the Uni-Power into his body to become Captain Universe. Gladiator attempts to stop Krosakis but fails, with the warlord finally beaten by the Silver Surfer."
"Gladiator is then commanded to stop the conqueror Vulcan, who is determined to destroy the Shi'ar empire as revenge against former emperor D'Ken for murdering Vulcan's mother. Gladiator captures and delivers Vulcan to a Shi'ar prison facility."
"A Shi'ar agent, however, wishing a return to the days of D'Ken's rule, frees Vulcan and together with Deathbird the pair stage a coup and usurp Lilandra. Vulcan escapes with the aid of some rebellious Shi'ar and leads a successful coup against Lilandra, becoming the next Shi'ar Emperor. Gladiator does not like Vulcan, but is honor-bound to serve him."
"Vulcan consolidates his rule over the Shi'ar - with Gladiator reluctantly assisting - as their forces destroy a race of ancient enemies, the Scy'ar Tal, and capture the rebel Starjammers. Vulcan begins to expand the empire, leading to a war with the Kree. When ordered to kill Lilandra, Gladiator abandons his post to protect her. During an attempt to return her to the throne, she is assassinated."
"Vulcan is killed during a battle with the leader of the Kree, Black Bolt. With no one in line to inherit the throne, civil war threatens the Shi'ar empire. Gladiator accepts an offer to be Emperor to avoid further conflict."
"Following the war with the cancerverse, Gladiator joins the Annihilators. With them, he protects Galador from the Dire Wraiths and opposes the Universal Church of Truth's attempt to revive the Magus."
"Gladiator's son, Kubark, also known as Kid Gladiator, is sent to Earth with bodyguard Warbird (Ava'Dara Naganandini) as a punishment and is enrolled in the Jean Grey School For Higher Learning to train and learn more about his powers."
"During the ""Avengers vs. X-Men"" storyline, Gladiator attempts to contact Kubark's bodyguard Warbird about the Phoenix Force's return to Earth. Gladiator orders them to leave the planet, but the close proximity of the Phoenix prevents the message from reaching Warbird. He then orders the preparation of his ship so he could go rescue his son and sends Death Commandos to kill the Phoenix's host. He is overwhelmed by the combined Phoenix Force Five and forced to recuperate at the X-Mansion."
"During the ""Infinity"" storyline, Gladiator appeared as a member of the Galactic Council. Kubark participates in the Infinity incidents, sneaking into battle against his father's wishes. Kubark's performance in battle so impresses Gladiator he allows his son to return to his desired schooling back in the X-Mansion."
"In the aftermath of the ""Infinity Wars"" storyline, Gladiator and the Shi'ar Empire arrive to save everyone after they were ejected from a hole in the space station following the Black Order stealing Thanos' body during the funeral. Gladiator joins up with Starfox's Dark Guardians. The Dark Guardians found Nova and ambush him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet. When Gladiator and Cosmic Ghost Rider order Wraith to back off, Nova takes the chance to fly off again. The Dark Guardians plan to track down again."
"Gladiator possesses a number of superhuman capabilities as a result of his unique alien physiology including superhuman strength (capable of shattering a planet, ripping apart a black hole, and holding off the Destroyer armor), superhuman speed, stamina and durability (capable of withstanding the heat emitted from the Phoenix Force, a blast comparable to the full power of Odin, direct attacks from Thor and Mjolnir, point blank planetary explosions, and an explosion equivalent to a supernova ), reflexes, microscopic and telescopic vision, X-ray vision, heat vision (stated as ""hotter than a star""); super-breath, ""frost breath"", super-hearing (capable of hearing sounds from light years away in space), a regenerative healing factor, psionic resistance (capable of withstanding mental attacks from telepaths to a certain degree), and warp speed flight (measured as ""a hundred times the speed of light"", and shown moving across galaxies before Heimdall could blink). Gladiator's abilities increase and decrease in accordance with his level of confidence and he is vulnerable to a certain form of rare radiation. Gladiator also has advanced longevity, having survived for centuries with very little aging."
"In the alternate universe title ""Marvel Zombies 2"", the character appears with other extraterrestrial beings ""recruited"" by the Galacti (the original infected heroes empowered by devouring the entity Galactus). He is killed while trying to eat the humans under the protection of the Black Panther and Forge."
"In the alternate universe title ""Last Planet Standing"", the character appears with the Imperial Guard but fails to stop Dominas the Wavemaster and Galactus from destroying the Shi'ar homeworld."
"He physically battles the USS ""Enterprise"" itself during the ""Star Trek/X-Men"" crossover."
"Gladiator appears in the animated television series ""X-Men"". His first appearance is in the episode ""Mojovision"", but only as one of Mojo's robots programmed to look like Gladiator. The real Gladiator first appears in the episode ""Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee."""
"Gladiator appears as a boss in """", voiced by Dave Wittenberg. He is among the Imperial Guard that works for Deathbird after she overthrew Lilandra. Unlike the other Imperial Guard, Gladiator admits that he does not enjoy serving Deathbird, but is honor-bound to serve whoever holds the throne. Gladiator can only be defeated by activating equipment around the battle area, thus weakening his invulnerability and giving the player the chance to hurt him. He has special dialogue with Iceman and Sabretooth (whom he mistakes for Wolverine)."

After Hyōga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a golden apple. She is then possessed by Eris, the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world.

Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiryū and Shun are wondering about Hyōga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At Valhalla, the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hyōga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiryū, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of Odin. Midgard reveals himself as Hyōga and tries to kill Shiryū to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hyōga."
"Due to this film's popularity, Toei Animation created the Asgard saga for the anime, which did not originally appear in the manga and is set between the Sanctuary and Poseidon arcs of the story."
"is the third anime film by Toei Animation based on the ""Saint Seiya"" manga.

"Athena receives the visit of Phoebus Abel, her older brother and God of the Corona. He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of Carina, Jaow of Lynx and Berenike of Coma Berenices, and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of Gemini, Deathmask of Cancer, Shura of Capricorn, Camus of Aquarius and Aphrodite of Pisces. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to Elysion, the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel."
"Unlike the other ""Saint Seiya"" movies made in the 1980s, this one was a full featured film, having a running time of 75 minutes. The events occur sometime after the Poseidon saga and before the Fallen Angels saga (4th movie)."

The Bronze Saints must then come to her rescue, destroying Lucifer's Fallen Angels (""Seima Tenshi"" in Japanese) in the process."
The soundtrack was composed by Seiji Yokoyama and released in the Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack VIII – Warriors of the Final Holy Battle CD.
"After the success of the OVA series ""Hades - Chapter Sanctuary"", this movie served as a continuation to the Hades saga. Injured after his confrontation with Hades, Seiya is in a coma and under Saori's care. The Goddess Artemis, Saori's older sister, comes to Earth to ask why she is not fulfilling her duties as a Goddess and takes control of Sanctuary in her stead. Hoping that it may bring peace on Earth, Saori goes to the Sanctuary and starts spilling her blood and it is up to the Bronze Saints to save her."
"After the bloody battle against Hades, goddess Athena's Saints are still recovering when they find themselves face to face with their newest and most formidable foe: the dreadful goddess Artemis, accompanied by her Angels. Artemis replaces Athena as the Earth guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants."
"Upon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control."
"The movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, Eagle Marin also appears, as Ophiuchus Shaina, Unicorn Jabu, and Hydra Ichi do, though the latter three are just cameos."
"The movie also has a very ambiguous ending, with many plot points and danglers unresolved."
A Live Action film was announced at Comic Con Brazil 2016.
= = = BBC Regional Programme = = =
"The BBC Regional Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced a number of earlier BBC local stations – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand, Westminster, London, which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of the six commercial companies which created the BBC), the technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or for joint programming between transmitters. Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities."
"By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible, at least between main transmitters and relay stations, but the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts."
"In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest."
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 1 kW.
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 120 W
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high-power mediumwave transmitter, 5GB, at its Daventry site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service – which eventually came to be called the BBC National Programme – programmed from London and available to the majority of the population."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme""."
The local transmitters were gradually either converted to a regional service relay or closed entirely and replaced by high power regional broadcasts. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX; initially these were on three separate frequencies and programming included some local variations. As the regional network expanded these transmissions were fully synchronized with those from Brookmans Park.
A relay station for Brookmans Park on 1402 kHz was due to open at Acle near Norwich in 1940. Construction was postponed by the outbreak of war. The station was never completed and was replaced by one at Postwick.
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The transmitter network was synchronized on 668 and 767 kHz in order to use the other frequencies for propaganda broadcasts in foreign languages. Each transmitter group would be turned off during an air raid to prevent their signals being used as navigational beacons and listeners were required to retune to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but kept the name ""BBC Home Service"". The National Programme was also reopened under a new name as the BBC Light Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light and dance music than its successor, the Home Service."

"A makeup brush is a tool with bristles, used for the application of makeup or face painting. The bristles may be made out of natural or synthetic materials, while the handle is usually made out of plastic or wood. When cosmetics are applied using the appropriate brush, they blend better into the skin."
"There is a large variety of shapes and sizes of makeup brushes, depending on the face area where makeup will be applied, the cosmetic product and the wanted result. For example, the shape of the brush tip can be chiseled, straight, angular, round, flat or tapered."
Makeup application can alter due to the materials used to create a brush. The bristles of a makeup brush can either be synthetic or natural. The brush itself is important to the application of makeup as it can densely pack on product or loosely pack on product.
"Synthetic bristles are the most common material used in makeup brushes. These brushes are widely found in drugstores and makeup-specific stores. The bristles are made out of plastic, nylon, or other synthetic fibers, and may be dyed. Synthetic bristles are often used with liquid and cream products, as they tend to blend out products more easily and will not absorb product as much as a natural bristle brush. Synthetic brushes are cruelty-free. Synthetic brushes usually last longer than natural haired bristles as they do not degrade and are not as fragile."
"The natural bristles are often dark in color, not super soft, sheds, hold pigments better and difficult to wash. As the natural bristles are very porous they pick up more pigments and distributes them evenly. The natural bristled brushes best applies powder products and it is best to avoid liquid or cream products as they will drink up most of the products. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves can cause allergic reactions to the animal hair."
"Natural bristles may more easily control the product when blending out or even packing on a product, because they have hair cuticles."
= = = Kabuki brush = = =
"A kabuki brush (sometimes called mushroom brush) is a makeup brush with a short stem and dense bristles. The brush head is most often rounded, though it can also be flat. Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles."
"It is named after the Kabuki Japanese drama theater where actors wear ""Keshō"", a very heavy makeup that emphasizes the nature of their characters. There, the kabuki brush is used to apply the white rice powder uniformly on the entire face."
"Usually, a kabuki brush is used to apply loose powdered make-up on large surfaces of the face (e.g., foundation, face powder, blush). Because of its design, the brush blends powdered make up evenly on the skin and creates a very natural looking coverage."
= = = St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia = = =
St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia is located in the Manayunk section of Northwest Philadelphia at 124 Cotton Street. This parish was merged with those of St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012.
"The church was named in honor of Saint Josaphat, who was born circa 1580 as John Kuncevic in Vladimir, a village of the Lithuanian Province of Volhynia (then a part of the Polish Kingdom begun under the Jagiellonian dynasty), and who rose to increasing positions of authority within the church after professing his faith. Murdered in Vitebsk (Belarus) on November 12, 1623 while working to reunify the diocese he had been assigned to lead, he was declared ""Blessed"" by Pope Urban VIII in May 1643. He was then canonized as a saint on June 29, 1867 by Pope Pius IX and, on the tercentenary of his martyrdom (November 12, 1923) was declared by Pope Pius XI to be the heavenly Patron of Reunion between Orthodox and Catholics."" On November 25, 1963, during the Second Vatican Council, the remains of Saint Josaphat were officially laid to rest at the altar of St. Basil in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This action was ordered by Pope John XXIII."
"St. Josaphat's parish was founded in 1898. According to historians at the Polish American Liturgical Center in Orchard Lake, Michigan:"
"""Polish Immigrants looking to better themselves financially, settled where there was more work. In the section of Philadelphia called Manayunk, there was a great need for workers in steel, wool and paper plants. Towards the end of the 19th Century near the Schuylkill River, there was a large steel plant under the name of American Bridge Co. later called Penncoyd Iron Works who employed many of these hard working Poles. The Poles living in Manayunk were very happy with their employment, but a little saddened by the fact that they had no Polish Church of their own to which they could go to and pray to God, to sing in their native tongue and to thank God for the graces given them. The nearest Polish Church which they attended was so many miles away, and travel in those days was hard, because the Mother Church, St. Laurentius, was located in the part of Philadelphia called 'Fishtown.'"
"Representatives of the Local Group appealed to the Diocesan Authorities for permission to establish a Polish Church for the Polish People. Archbishop Ryan in 1898 sent Rev. Mieczyslaus Kopytkiewicz to organize the Parish. The first services were held in St. John's Lower Church. (Incidentally, the services were held here also when the present new church was being built.)"""
"The Rev. Henry Chajencki was then placed in charge of the parish in December 1898. Under his leadership, church leaders paid $25,000 for the old Fourth Reformed Presbyterian Church building on the corner of Silverwood and Cotton, and also purchased ""a double home on Grape Street that served as a Rectory and later as a Convent"" as they worked to grow their number of parishioners. A 36-year-old in failing health, Father Chajencki died on Christmas Day in 1900, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery. The Rev. Dr. Thomas Misicki served briefly as the parish's pastor until the Rev. Benedict Tomiak could formally take charge of the post. All three men had been residents of Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania."
"Father Tomiak, who had been ministering to the poor as a member of the Congregation of the Missionary Fathers of Saint Vincent de Paul when he was drafted into the military and sent to the front to nurse soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War, and had been ordained in 1893 at the age of 50 after resuming his studies in Rome post-war, had emigrated to America shortly thereafter. Following seven years of service in Shamokin and Mt. Carmel he was appointed to his position at St. Josaphat's on January 20, 1901. During his 11-year tenure, he launched a parish parochial school (soon after arriving) and invited the Bernardine Sisters in as faculty, and founded two orphanages (one in West Conshohocken and the other in his native Wolsztyn). As the parochial school's student population grew, the Bernardines were replaced by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from New Britain, Connecticut (c. 1905-1910) and then the Sisters of Nazareth (c. 1910-1911)."
"Following the aging Father Tomiak's transition to a new role as Chaplain of the Orphanage, the Rev. Paul Guzik arrived from Matopolska to take over Tomiak's role as head of the parish. Soon after beginning work, Guzik determined that the existing school building was no longer adequate, raised $40,000 to build a ""yellow brick eight-room school,"" and then invited the Bernardine Sisters to return as faculty before making the decision to return to Poland. He was succeeded in 1913 by the Rev. Joseph Poremba, of St. Casimir's Parish of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. Both the school and the parish flourished under Poremba's leadership, which ended when he died suddenly from a heart attack in 1920. He was then succeeded in June of that year by the pastor of St. Stanislaus in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, Rev. Louis Stachowicz, who went on to lead St. Josaphat's for nearly four decades. Among his successes were the addition of 12 classrooms to the school building between 1927 and 1928, the launch of high school classes in 1939 (the first Polish pastor to achieve this milestone), the construction of a new, $130,000 rectory in 1949, and the construction of a new church building at the corner of Silverwood and Cotton streets with a spacious hall below the structure, which was dedicated on March 16, 1958 by the Most Reverend John F. O'Hara, C.S., D.D., Archbishop of Philadelphia."
"Following Father Stachowicz's death on February 10, 1960, the Rev. John Sielecki of St. Stanislaus Parish became the new parish head. Prior to his death on August 3, 1967, he was able to inspire his congregation to build a new convent for the sisters who served the parish and pay off the high school's tuition debt. Sielecki was then succeeded by another St. Stanislaus priest, the Rev. Paul A. Lambarksi, who immediately set to work improving the school's heating and lavatories after beginning work in October 1967. In short order, he was also actively engaged in preparing for the church's Diamond Jubilee (75th anniversary)."
"In 1973, St. Josaphat's became the fourth Polish parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to celebrate its 75th anniversary Diamond Jubilee."
"The amateur division of the show known as the Competitive Classes often have an assigned theme, related to the overall show theme. The 2007 Show, Legends of Ireland, featured Pressed Plant Material (i.e. dried flower pictures) that ""incorporated a Celtic Knot."" The first weekend's Medium Niche theme was ""Wish You Were Here"" ""Exhibitors will be sent Irish postcards for inspiration. A copy of the postcard will be mounted next to the exhibit."" Entrants for that class typically have a mockup of the niche at home, where they practice assembling and lighting their entry in the months preceding the show. In a ""Challenge"" class, entrants bring only pruning shears, and must use show-provided materials to interpret a theme within a limited amount of time. Three typical ""Horticulture"" classes are 142: ""Clivia, flowering. Pot 8"" or under"", 143: ""Clivia, flowering. Pot 8""-10"""", and 144: ""Clivia, foliage"". (There was also a Clivia entered in 2007 under ""Exceptional plants 10–20 years old, to be judged against “perfection” for their species/cultivar."")"
"A popular part of the show floor is the Garden marketplace where visitors can buy plants and seeds, cut flowers, craft items, and other flower, landscaping and horticulture-related items."
"The Show boasts fabulous floral and garden design, live entertainment, culinary events and extraordinary gardening how-to workshops and lectures by experts."
"The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society was founded in 1827. The nation's first flower show was held in Philadelphia in 1829, and showcased many exotic and native plants. The flower show moved to the now-demolished Philadelphia Civic Center in 1966, where it remained each year until 1996, when it moved to its present location at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Today, PHS contributes to the local economy and the green life of Philadelphia and the region. Proceeds from the Flower Show support thousands of revitalization projects in communities. In recent years, a youth division was added to the pressed flower category, with the most recent winner being Kendall Wolson, a 17-year-old student from New Jersey who created a scene depicting two bears catching fish in a river."
= = = Bamboozle (quiz) = = =
"Bamboozle! was a quiz game featured on Channel 4 Teletext in the United Kingdom. It was originally part of Teletext's ""Fun & Games"" category, though the rest of the category had been discontinued for some years before Bamboozle! ended (due to the general discontinuation of all Teletext news and editorial content in December 2009). The last edition, themed around 'Ends and Lasts', appeared on Monday 14 December 2009. The Boozler 'family' appeared one last time on Tuesday 15 December 2009 saying farewell to the Teletext audience."
"On 9 August 2010 Bamboozle! was given a new home by Teletext on the iPhone complete with all the retro graphics. On 11 July 2019, Teletext Holidays launched a version of the Bamboozle quiz on their 404 error page."
"Bamboozle! was originally intended as a real-time game that could be played in conjunction with a broadcast TV programme using a similar multiple choice format as ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". The decision by the new broadcast teletext franchise holders (Teletext UK) in 1993 to opt for X.25 packet switching meant that it was impossible to adequately synchronise the broadcast of teletext content in the context of a TV programme. The format thus fell back to the form it had operated in largely unchanged since 1994."
"The game used Fastext keys (different coloured buttons on the TV remote control) to select the desired answer from a choice of four, and was ""presented"" by virtual host Bamber Boozler, who derived his name from the word ""bamboozle"" and the name of University Challenge host, Bamber Gascoigne. Bamber Boozler's appearance was constrained by the limitations of the Level 1 World System Teletext alpha mosaic display format. From 1993–2005, Teletext competitions editor Julian Edwards created the quiz ""Bamber Boozler"" and the character ""Bamber Boozler"". In later years, journalists Charlie Ghagan and, latterly, Roger Wilkinson oversaw the quiz. Roger Wilkinson also provides content for the Teletext iPhone app."
"A new set of questions was originally given each week, but this soon became more regular, eventually becoming daily. Each game originally had 25 questions, later reduced to 20, then 15 and eventually 12. The player was required to answer all questions correctly in order to complete the quiz, but was allowed multiple attempts to do so. Initially, if a question was answered incorrectly, the player would have to start again from Question 1, However this was later amended so that a maximum of three questions would need to be answered again. After completing the quiz, there was a score table with themed responses, for example:"
according to how many questions were answered correctly at the first attempt.
"On particular dates the quiz was themed, for example Halloween featured related questions and images of skeletons and spiders, whilst Guy Fawkes Night featured firework based questions, as well as numerous Christmas based versions. There were also special ""name the picture / person"" graphical editions."
"Other Boozler family members were introduced over the game's first few years – Bamber's wife, Bambette, who normally appeared when a question was answered incorrectly; while Saturday's quizzes were generally easier than the weekday editions and were presented by Bamber's son, Buster, with Bambette's role filled by Bonnie, his daughter. At one point in the quiz's history the red, yellow and green keys were sensible answers and the blue was mostly reserved for a comical response although rarely was the correct one. This was later changed and all the keys would have sensible answers."
"The quiz started off at 20 questions, then it went down to 15 and then 12. On very few special occasions it was 30, however one question wrong and contestants had to start from the very beginning."
"The ""Bad Luck"" pages appeared when questions were answered incorrectly, they used to feature little trivial messages at first and then mainly birthday announcements. This was scrapped to introduce ""Bambette's Bonus"" (or Bonnie's Bonus in Junior Bamboozle) where contestants could score again with a question from her. This was not a multiple choice question and contestants could get the answer by pressing the reveal button."
"The makers of ""Bamboozle!"" introduced a weekly competition whereby a viewer could contribute the questions to Bamboozle! As well as having their questions used, names mentioned and their image appear on screen (the viewer could supply a photograph, which was converted to a Teletext-style cartoon); the winning contributors also received a £20 WHSmith gift voucher. Even before this, viewer-submitted questions were readily used in various forms ever since the early days of the quiz."
"Back in the early days of ""Bamboozle!"", on a number of occasions the quiz would be put on hold and in its place was an adventure game (a different one each time), based on the popular children's fantasy programme ""Knightmare"". Viewers had to use the fastext keys to navigate their way through the quest."
"""Ten to One"", was a sports version of ""Bamboozle!"" with the host Brian Boozler. The quiz was so called because it presented ten sports questions and players had to get from the ten down to one. It is a double meaning as Ten to One also relates to bookies popular odds on betting in many sports."
"This quiz ran concurrently with Bamboozle! for sometime until late 1998 where Brian said ""I'm putting down the mic for a bit, I'm back in 1999..."", however it never returned. He was however, during the period that the quiz was ""rested"", a guest quizmaster on Bamboozle! asking the contestants sports questions like before, with Bamber saying at the end ""Thanks Brian... check your score below!""."
"""Junior Bamboozle!"" was a version run on Saturdays for children. It was hosted by Buster Boozler and the bad luck pages were hosted by Bonnie Boozler."
= = = Mike and Ike = = =
"Mike and Ike is a brand of fruit-flavored candies that were first introduced in 1940 by the company Just Born, Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years."
"The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the Matina Brothers, two of whom, nicknamed ""Mike"" & ""Ike,"" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as Munchkins in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz""; the author Dean Jensen wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them. . Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a vaudeville song titled “Mike and Ike”, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose nickname was ""Ike."" Just Born acquired the ""Rodda Candy Company"" in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since."
"Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar. The candy is kosher and gluten-free."
"They are similar to Hot Tamales, another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy."
"Just Born produces several varieties of Mike and Ikes, including:"
Retro/limited varieties include:
There are also seasonal packages for Easter in which the Mike and Ike flavors are formed as jelly beans.

"The 1887–88 British Home Championship was the fifth edition of the annual international football tournament played between the British Home Nations. It was the first edition of the tournament in which Scotland did not at least share in the trophy and was also notable for a record flood of goals, 46 in six games, 26 of them conceded by Ireland, who suffered a disastrous competition."
"England began the tournament in the same vein as they finished it, winning the opening match 5–1 against Wales at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe. Wales responded to this, and to their shock defeat by Ireland the year previously with an 11–0 thrashing of the visiting Irish, a Welsh record scoreline which remains standing after nearly 120 years. Any hopes of a recovery for the Welsh were however dashed in their final game when Scotland administered a 5–1 beating in Edinburgh."
"England returned to the fray and gained revenge for their narrow defeat in the deciding match of the previous year when they in turn thrashed Scotland 5–0 in London, leaving only the weak Irish in between them and the trophy. Before this however, Ireland received another massive defeat at the hands of Scotland, who beat them 2–10 in Belfast to take second place. In the final game, England needed only a draw to secure the title but managed a win by five goals to one to take their first undisputed championship."

= = = Katanpää-class mine countermeasure vessel = = =
"""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are a class of three multipurpose mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV) ordered by the Finnish Navy. The nearly 250 million euro contract was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.p.A. in 2006. Initially, all three vessels were scheduled to be delivered by 2014 and the class was expected to achieve operational readiness by 2015, but there have been various delays and the last vessel was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016."
"The ""Katanpää"" class is expected to remain in service until 2040–2042."
"In its safety and defence policy report of 2004 the Finnish Government announced that, in addition to training mobile coastal troops and protecting sea traffic, the Finnish Navy would start focusing on developing its mine countermeasure capabilities. As a result a decision was made to retire the aging ""Kuha""-class minesweepers and invest in a new mine countermeasure fleet, which would include minehunters and -sweepers, divers and a new mine warfare information system."
"A request for bids was published on 5 June 2004 and by 3 January 2005 the Finnish Navy had received offers from seven shipyards, both domestic and foreign. After an extensive evaluation it was decided to continue negotiations with Intermarine S.p.A of Italy. Kockums AB of Sweden and Navantia SA from Spain. Aker Finnyards Oy (Finland), Armaris SA (France), Lürssen Werft GmbH and Abeking & Rasmussen GmbH (both German) were left out. In November 2006 the contract for three mine countermeasure vessels was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.P.A. The total order worth was 244.8 million euros and it will include a spare parts package. About 50% of the total cost is contracted for Finnish companies and the shipbuilding contract includes a 100% offset agreement."
"The construction of the first vessel began in July 2007 with the ceremony of ""start of lamination"" which, for vessels built of composite materials, equals to the steel cutting ceremony. The construction of the second vessel was started in March 2008 and the third vessel in February 2009. The construction of the vessels was delayed by one year after the shipyard was devastated by a flood in early 2009. Two more floods occurred in late 2009, but the damage was not as extensive."
"The lead vessel of the class, ""Katanpää"", began its sea trials in March 2011, but due to additional delays it was not delivered until 4 May 2012. The vessel was shipped to Finland onboard BigLift heavy lift vessel ""Happy Dover"" which left Italy on 21 May. ""Katanpää"" was presented to the public in Helsinki on 9 July 2012, the 94th anniversary of the Finnish Navy. The second vessel, ""Purunpää"", was delivered to the Finnish Navy on 20 August 2013 and arrived in Turku onboard ""Happy Dynamic"" one month later. The third vessel, initially expected by 2015, was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016 and will arrive in Finland in December."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are expected to remain in service until 2040-2042."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels were initially referred to as the MCMV 2010 class after the mine countermeasure development project and ""MITO class"" after the Finnish word for mine countermeasures, ""miinantorjunta"". As naval vessel classes of the Finnish Navy are traditionally named after the lead ship of the class, the new class of mine countermeasure vessels received its final name when the first vessel was named ""Katanpää"" (pennant number 40) on 16 June 2009. The second vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class received its name, ""Purunpää"" (41), on 26 September 2010 and the third one was named ""Vahterpää"" (42) on 3 November 2011."
"The vessels have been named after historical locations, Katanpää being an old island fortress and naval port outside Kustavi in Western Finland, Purunpää an old harbor site in Dragsfjärd and Vahterpää an old naval base outside Loviisa in the Gulf of Finland. The same names were also carried by three of the four BYMS class minesweepers operated by the Finnish Navy in the 1950s. For the new class of vessels, the Finnish Navy has adopted a new prefix ""MHC"" which stands for ""Mine Hunter Coastal""."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are constructed of laminated composite materials. They are long and have a beam of and a draft of . The hull, decks and bulkheads are made of fiberglass, which in places are up to thick. The decks are additionally reinforced with balsa and carbon fiber. This improves shock resistance against underwater explosions and reduces the vessels' magnetic, noise and pressure signatures that could detonate the mines. The low-signature diesel-electric propulsion system consists of two MTU 8V-396-TE74 high-speed diesel engines, each producing , and two Voith Schneider propellers. The ""Katanpää""-class vessels are designed to operate in archipelagoes, coastal regions and open seas, and are capable of operating in ice. They will have a service speed of and a maximum range of ."
"The ""Katanpää""-class vessels will be equipped with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over . It is equipped with a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and SeaFox I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam echosounder and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment echosounder with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will be equipped with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions."
"Each vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class is equipped with a Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun for self-defence. The fire control is provided by Atlas Elektronik and the integrated system utilizes EOTS TV/IR multisensors. The system can be controlled from either one of five consoles in the combat information center or from the bridge, although only one console is equipped with the pedals required to control the gun. In addition the vessels are armed with depth charges."

= = = Tripartite Accord (Angola) = = =
"The Agreement among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa (also known as the Tripartite Accord, Three Powers Accord or New York Accords) granted independence to Namibia from South Africa and ended the direct involvement of foreign troops in the Angolan Civil War. The accords were signed on 22 December 1988 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by the Foreign Ministers of People's Republic of Angola (Afonso Van-Dunem), Republic of Cuba (Isidoro Malmierca Peoli) and Republic of South Africa (Roelof F. Botha)."
"In 1981 Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs for newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan, had developed a linkage policy. It tied apartheid South Africa's agreement to relinquish control of Namibia, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, and to retreat from Angola, to Cuba's withdrawing its troops from Angola. On 10 September 1986 Cuban president Fidel Castro accepted Crocker's proposal in principle. The South African government also accepted the principle of linkage; it proposed the concept at the UN 7th Plenary Meeting on 20 September 1986 (the Question of Namibia)."
"The concept was strongly rejected by a Cuban-backed majority, with representatives strongly stating their opposition to the effect of, ""... The UN... Calls upon South Africa to desist from linking the independence of Namibia to irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola as such linkage is incompatible with the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978);..."""
The Angolan and United States governments started bilateral talks in June 1987 while the civil war continued. There is disagreement amongst historians on how the various parties agreed to come to the table:
"In the words of Chester Crocker, ""Watching South Africa and Cuba at the table was like watching two scorpions in a bottle."""
"After refusing direct talks with Cuba, the US agreed to include a Cuban delegation in the negotiations, who joined on January 28, 1988. The three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9 in London. The South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May expecting UN Security Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister Magnus Malan and President P.W. Botha asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only ""if Russia and its proxies did the same."" They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. On 16 March 1988, the South African ""Business Day"" reported that Pretoria was ""offering to withdraw into Namibia – not from Namibia – in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon."" However the UN plenary meeting of 1986 indicates that the South Africans were linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal. The Cuban negotiator, Jorge Risquet, announced that Cuba would stay in Angola until the end of apartheid, probably also as a negotiation ploy. (Apartheid did not end until more than 4 years after Cuba left Angola)."
"The Cubans suggested that the U.S. was worried whether the Cuban forces would stop their advance at the Namibian border. Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, rejected the South African demands, noting that ""South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield."""
"According to the book ""32 Battalion"" by Piet Nortje, during this campaign South Africa introduced its new secret weapons, the G5 and G6 howitzer guns. The cannons can fire a projectile over with a high degree of accuracy. The guns were used to halt the Cuban advance to the south and raised the specter of yet another unaffordable arms escalation between two medium-sized military powers. The South Africans assert that the new weapon raised Cuba's fear of more casualties in a war where Cuban fatalities had outnumbered South African fatalities by a factor 10. Conversely, the Cuban air force held air superiority, as was demonstrated by the bombing of the strategic Calueque complex, and the overflights in 1988 of Cuban Mig-23's of Namibian airspace. According to David Albright, South Africa believed that the discovery of preparations for a nuclear weapon test at the Vastrap facility created an urgency amongst the superpowers to find a solution."
"The negotiations reached a deadlock that was broken by the South African negotiator, Pik Botha, who convinced Jorge Riquet that, in the words of Botha ""...We can both be losers and we can both be winners..."" Pik Botha offered a compromise that would appear to be palatable to both sides while emphasising that the alternative would be detrimental to both sides."
"While the hostilities in Angola continued, the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. Finally all approved an outline agreement of ""Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in South Western Africa"" on 20 July. During the negotiations, the South Africans were asked to release imprisoned ANC activist Nelson Mandela as a sign of goodwill, which was denied. A ceasefire was finally agreed upon on August 8, 1988. Mandela remained in prison until 2 February 1990, when South Africa lifted the ban on activities of the ANC African National Congress."
"The negotiations were finalised in New York with Angola, Cuba and South Africa signing the accord on 22 December 1988. It provided for the retreat of South African forces from Angola, which had already taken place by 30 August; the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia; and Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola within 30 months."
"The agreement followed the American linkage proposal which had also been pushed by South African on numerous occasions in 1984 and in 1986 (the UN plenary meeting). Namibia was to gain independence on terms that South Africa had set out, including multi-party democracy, a capitalist free-market economy, and a transition period."
"The South African Army left Angola by 30 August 1988, before the conditions for Cuba's withdrawal had been agreed. Cuban troops began withdrawing on 10 January 1989, and the withdrawal was finalised in stages one month early on 25 May 1991."
"The Angolan government offered an amnesty to UNITA troops under the premise that UNITA would be integrated into the MPLA under a one-party state economy. That concept was rejected by UNITA. The situation in the country was anything but settled, and civil war continued for more than a decade."
"According to ""Presidents of Foreign Policy"" by Edward R. Drachman and Alan Shank, a series of meetings and accords between UNITA and the MPLA, brokered by various African leaders, failed horribly. UNITA was insulted by MPLA's insistence on a premise of a one-party state. A combination of MPLA dismay of intervention from the USA (backing UNITA and forcing a shift in power) led to the MPLA dropping the one-party state and opening the door to a multi-party democracy, with the inclusion of UNITA as a competing party. After some 18 years of war, that was a tremendous breakthrough."
"The elections were declared ""generally"" free and fair by the UN, with the MPLA gaining just under 50% of the vote. However UNITA, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said that the election had been neither free nor fair. Following the Halloween Massacre, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi directed UNITA forces to take up arms again against the MPLA. However, the US now opposed UNITA, instead pressuring Savimbi to accept the election results. The war ended after Savimbi's death, in 2002."
"In preparation for independence, free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote. Namibia gained independence in March 1990. SWAPO was originally a Marxist party that intended to install a one-party state. The South African government rejected that premise until the fall of the Soviet Union and SWAPO assured that it would support a multi-party democracy with a capitalist, free market economy."
South Africa held onto Namibia's economic port of Walvis Bay for an additional 18 months until it was assured that SWAPO would respect the newly-founded constitution and the principle of a multi-party democracy.
The party's provincial governments faced attacks from leftists and Maoists who advocated armed conflict to take land from landlords and feudals. These attacks were allegedly on the behest of leftists within the Pakistan People's Party.
"On March 23, 1973, the Federal Security Force, a paramilitary force under the alleged orders of Bhutto, attacked a public opposition rally at the Liaquat Bagh in the town of Rawalpindi and killed a dozen people; many more were wounded by their automatic gunfire. Wali Khan narrowly escaped a bullet during the attack. Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies on the streets in Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly with their bereaved families."
Following the massacre the Federal Security Force launched a crackdown against the party that led to many senior leaders including Ajmal Khattak to flee into exile to Kabul.
"The Balochistan government immediately faced multiple crise,s the first of which was when the Balochistan police department, mostly officered by people from Punjab or Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving. Despite this fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister, moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile as a qualification and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar."
Unable to exercise any effective authority Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organization to assist in security.
The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra-tribal conflict. The Baloch nationalists declared that it was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan but without evidence to prove the statements issued.
"However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government, fresh from the humiliation of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to dismember Pakistan and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973, in protest against the decision the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government resigned in protest. Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders."
"In the face of an increasingly strong national campaign led by the NAP against the government, Bhutto banned NAP on February 8, 1975 after the murder of his close colleague Hayat Khan Sherpao, throwing thousands of its workers and much of its leadership, including party President Khan Abdul Wali Khan, in jail for alleged anti-state activities."
"Invoking the 1st amendment of the 1973 constitution the government charged Wali Khan and his colleagues under the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case in 1976, although they were acquitted of the charge of the murder of PPP stalwart Hayat Khan Sherpao, the decision to ban the NAP was upheld by the courts. In addition to Khan Abdul Wali Khan, the case also implicated two governors, two chief ministers, scores of national and provincial parliamentarians, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Kaswar Gardezi, Habib Jalib (Urdu revolutionary poet) and Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Balochi Revolutionary Poet/Leader) and even some of Bhutto’s former colleagues, many of whom were later re-elected and became federal or provincial ministers."
"With the NAP leadership largely imprisoned, a new political party was formed on the wreckage of the NAP in 1976 by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. Named National Democratic Party (NDP), it was headed by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Hyderabad case was withdrawn after General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law in July 1977. Wali Khan left party affairs to Sher Baz Mazari after his release from jail in 1979. The party faced a split at that time between far left elements led by Khair Bakhsh Marri advocating outright separation and armed struggle and those advocating political struggle led by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The split ended the alliance between Pashtun Nationalists and Baloch Nationalists that Wali Khan had formed in 1969 and led to the formation of the Pakistan National Party."
Sherbaz Khan Mazari led the NDP into joining the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. The alliance with former rivals the PPP did not go down well with Ghaffar Khan who encouraged by Governor Fazle Haq warned Ghaffar Khan of what would happen if the PPP returned to power.
This move led to a split between Mazari and Wali Khan which were aggravated after Wali Khan in a statement rejected the 1973 constitution and Wali Khan's election as NDP President.
The NDP was merged with other nationalist parties from Balochistan and Sindh in 1986 in Karachi to launch a new political party named Awami National Party with Wali Khan as its president and Rasul Bux Palejo as its general-secretary.

"The TalkOrigins Archive began in 1994 when Brett J. Vickers collected several separately posted FAQs from the talk.origins newsgroup and made them available from a single anonymous FTP site. In 1995, Vickers, then a computer science graduate student at the University of California at Irvine, created the TalkOrigins Archive web site. In 2001, Vickers transferred the TalkOrigins Archive to Wesley R. Elsberry, who organized a group of volunteers to handle the maintenance of the Archive."

The Foundation's purposes include funding and maintaining the TalkOrigins Archive and holding copyrights to Archive articles, thereby simplifying the process of reprinting and updating those articles. The copyright issue has posed a particular problem since the FAQs started off as a small collection with little thought given to copyright but have since mushroomed. In 2005, the Foundation was granted tax-exempt status by the IRS."

"Mihailo Marković, PhD (; 24 February 1923 – 7 February 2010) was a Serbian philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the Praxis School, a Marxist humanist movement that originated in Yugoslavia."
"A co-author of the SANU Memorandum, Marković was a prominent supporter of Slobodan Milošević in the late 1980s and 1990s."
"Marković was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He became a member of the youth organization of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a partisan he actively participated in the struggle for liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II."
"Marković took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on ""The Concept of Logic"". In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966–1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Marković was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975–1985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983."
"In his honour, a collection of articles entitled ""Philosophy and Society"" was published in Belgrade in 1987."
"After the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Marković took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ""Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR"", published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia."
"In the 1960s Marković became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal ""Praxis"". Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Marković was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Marković worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986."
"As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Marković, together with Vasilije Krestić and others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation."
"Marković was vice-president of the Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party."
= = = Small rhombihexahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small rhombihexahedron (or small rhombicube) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 18 faces (12 squares and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is an antiparallelogram."
This polyhedron shares the vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the convex rhombicuboctahedron (having 12 square faces in common) and with the small cubicuboctahedron (having the octagonal faces in common).
It may be constructed as the exclusive or (blend) of three octagonal prisms.
= = = Small cubicuboctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 20 faces (8 triangles, 6 squares, and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"The cubicuboctahedron is a faceting of the rhombicuboctahedron. Its name comes from that the square faces lying on the planes corresponding to the rhombic dodecahedron, has been replaced by six octagonal faces parallel to the square faces of the cube."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the small rhombihexahedron (having the octagonal faces in common)."
"As the Euler characteristic suggests, the small cubicuboctahedron is a toroidal polyhedron of genus 3 (topologically it is a surface of genus 3), and thus can be interpreted as a (polyhedral) immersion of a genus 3 polyhedral surface, in the complement of its 24 vertices, into 3-space. (A neighborhood of any vertex is topologically a cone on a figure-8, which cannot occur in an immersion. Note that the Richter reference overlooks this fact.) The underlying polyhedron (ignoring self-intersections) defines a uniform tiling of this surface, and so the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform polyhedron. In the language of abstract polytopes, the small cubicuboctahedron is a ""faithful realization"" of this abstract toroidal polyhedron, meaning that it is a nondegenerate polyhedron and that they have the same symmetry group. In fact, every automorphism of the abstract genus 3 surface with this tiling is realized by an isometry of Euclidean space."
"Higher genus surfaces (genus 2 or greater) admit a metric of negative constant curvature (by the uniformization theorem), and the universal cover of the resulting Riemann surface is the hyperbolic plane. The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane has vertex figure 3.8.4.8 (triangle, octagon, square, octagon). If the surface is given the appropriate metric of curvature = −1, the covering map is a local isometry and thus the ""abstract"" vertex figure is the same. This tiling may be denoted by the Wythoff symbol 3 4 | 4, and is depicted on the right."
"Alternatively and more subtly, by chopping up each square face into 2 triangles and each octagonal face into 6 triangles, the small cubicuboctahedron can be interpreted as a non-regular ""coloring"" of the combinatorially ""regular"" (not just ""uniform"") tiling of the genus 3 surface by 56 equilateral triangles, meeting at 24 vertices, each with degree 7. This regular tiling is significant as it is a tiling of the Klein quartic, the genus 3 surface with the most symmetric metric (automorphisms of this tiling equal isometries of the surface), and the orientation-preseserving automorphism group of this surface is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), equivalently GL(3,2) (the order 168 group of all orientation-preserving isometries). Note that the small cubicuboctahedron is ""not"" a realization of this abstract polyhedron, as it only has 24 orientation-preserving symmetries (not every abstract automorphism is realized by a Euclidean isometry) – the isometries of the small cubicuboctahedron preserve not only the triangular tiling, but also the coloring, and hence are a proper subgroup of the full isometry group."
"The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane (the universal covering) is the order-7 triangular tiling. The automorphism group of the Klein quartic can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the polyhedron, namely ""exchanging the two endpoints of the edges that bisect the squares and octahedra) to yield the Mathieu group M."

"He has directed 123 Ph.D. students, as well as many postdoctoral associates and visiting professors, now working at 42 academic institutions around the world."
"Research within the Schaefer group involves the use of computational hardware and theoretical methods to solve problems in molecular quantum mechanics. His contributions to the field of quantum chemistry include a paper challenging, on theoretical grounds, the geometry of triplet methylene as assigned by Nobel Prize-winning experimentalist Gerhard Herzberg; the development of the Z-vector method simplifying certain calculations of correlated systems; and a wide body of work undertaken in his research group on the geometries, properties, and reactions of chemical systems using highly accurate ""ab initio"" quantum chemical techniques. Many of these papers have predicted, or forced a reinterpretation of, experimental results."
"Schaefer was awarded the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry in 1979 ""for the development of computational quantum chemistry into a reliable quantitative field of chemistry and for prolific exemplary calculations of broad chemical interest"". The Pure Chemistry Award is given to the outstanding chemist in America under the age of 35. In 1983 he received the Leo Hendrik Baekeland award for the most distinguished North American chemist under the age of 40. In 1992, he was awarded the Centenary Prize of the Royal Society of Chemistry, London, with a citation that included ""the first theoretical chemist successfully to challenge the accepted conclusion of a distinguished experimental group for a polyatomic molecule, namely methylene."""
"In 2003, Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Award in Theoretical Chemistry and the Ira Remsen Award of Johns Hopkins University. In 2004, a six-day conference was convened in Gyeongju, Korea on the “Theory and Applications of Computational Chemistry: A Celebration of 1000 Papers of Professor Henry F. Schaefer III.” Schaefer was honored with the $10,000 Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in 2005 by the University of Wisconsin's Theoretical Chemistry Institute, joining a distinguished list of some of the best-known scientists in the field."
"In 2011 Schaefer received the prestigious Ide P. Trotter Prize of Texas A&M University. Previous recipients of the Trotter Prize include Nobelists Francis Crick, Charles Townes, Steven Weinberg, William Phillips, and Roald Hoffmann."
"In 2012 he received a Humboldt Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, and on March 29, 2012 he received the $20,000 SURA Distinguished Scientist Award, given to the outstanding scientist in any field in the 17 southern states of the US, for fulfilling SURA's mission of fostering excellence in scientific research."

"Schaefer received the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal on May 8, 2019."
"Schaefer is also an active Protestant Christian educator who regularly speaks to university audiences (over 500 to date), Christian groups and the public on science/faith issues. In 2003, he published ""Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?"", a collection of essays and talks on the subject. A second edition appeared in 2016. He is a member of the Christian Faculty Forum at the University of Georgia."
"On January 25. 2008, Schaefer was invited to present a lecture entitled 'The Big Bang, Stephen Hawking and God' at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, during TECHFEST, Asia's largest technology festival. This evoked a response from a group of six atheist students in the form of handbills. Schaefer was, however, invited to return to IIT Bombay to present an Institute Lecture in February 2014. In 2016, Schaefer was again invited to present a plenary lecture at TECHFEST. His lecture on December 17, ""The Life of a Scientist,"" was presented to a large audience without incident. On December 14, 2018, Schaefer gave another plenary lecture at TECHFEST."
"There has been some controversy concerning the designation of Schaefer as a ""five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize."" The original source of this estimate is a December 23, 1991 cover article from U.S. News & World Report."
"The names of nominees and other information about the Nobel nomination process cannot be revealed for 50 years following the nomination discussions, so such a designation is speculative."

Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about . It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts."
"This public park was first named as Meade’s Park after Sir John Meade, the acting Commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in 1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence."
"The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment. Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'."
The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'.
"The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of the park are accessible through walking paths."
The Park is open to the public at all times but the roads around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh environment for morning walkers and exercisers.
Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a total of around 6000 plants/trees. Indigenous species found in the park are:
"artocarpus, cassia fistula, ficus, polyalthias etc., and exotic species such as araucaria, bamboo, castanospermum australe, grevillea robusta, millettia, peltophorum, schinus molle, swietenia mahagoni, tabebuia. sp etc."
"Amongst the ornamental and flowering exotic trees lining the roads in the park are the Grevillea robusta (silver oak)—the first oaks introduced to Bangalore from Australia—and the delonix or the gulmohar tree (bright red flowers with long petals) along the Cubbon road in the park, which is a widely cultivated tropical ornamental tree around the world."
"The avenue of araucarias along with canna beds on either sides of the road from the Central Public Library to Hudson circle, avenue of Swieteninas in the Northern side of the park, the Java fig avenue along the road leading to the Government Museum, polyalthia avenue along the road from Queen Victoria’s statue to King Edward VII's statue and the chestnut tree avenue from the Chamarajendra statue to Siddalingaiah circle are testimony to the botanical richness of the park. Other attractions at the Park are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook."
"The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices) now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to the Museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira Priyadarshini Children’s Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika — the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa Chatter."
"A bandstand, in an octagonal shape made with cast-iron, was built in the early part of the 1900s. Before India’s Independence, the British Royal Air Force used to play western band music at the band stand every Saturday evening."
"An attraction for children is the well planned children's amusement park as part of Jawahar Bal Bhavan, which has the toy train, Puttani Express that runs (0.75 miles or 1.2 km) within the Park, the Doll museum and a boating facility. A 20-million-year-old fossilized tree — a gift from the Geological Survey of India, is also reported at the park."
"Memorials in the form of marble statues in honour of Queen Victoria (installed in 1906), King Edward VII (installed in 1919), Major General Sir Mark Cubbon, Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (installed in 1927) and Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer (installed (in 1913) are seen located in front of the historical buildings within the park."
"The game, along with the original ""Hotline Miami"", was released as part of the ""Hotline Miami Collection"" for the Nintendo Switch on 19 August 2019."
"Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it holds an aggregated score of 75/100 based on 18 reviews for the PlayStation 4 Version, one of 74/100 based on 67 reviews for the PC version, and one of 66/100 based on four reviews for the PlayStation Vita version. Danny O'Dwyer from GameSpot gave the game a 9/10, praising its techno and intense soundtrack, entertaining, engaging and challenging gameplay, well-designed controls, striking and vibrant visuals, improved enemy placement, lengthy story, as well as the huge variety of characters, levels and locations. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective. However, he criticized the lack of weapon customization. He summarized the game by saying that ""This is a confident follow-up which improves upon the original in almost every way. This is a tremendously stylish game which entertains throughout, and delights in forcing you out of your comfort zone."
"Chris Carter from Destructoid also awarded the game a 9/10, praising the open-ended gameplay, engrossing story, accessible interface and level-creator, as well as the game for allowing players to utilize creativity and strategy in every level. However, he criticized the poor AI. He summarized the game by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2"" may not be as ""profound"" as its predecessor, but it's still a bloody good time."" Chloi Rad from IGN gave the game an 8.8/10, praising its high replay value, engaging story, sizable maps, rich characters' backstory, character-specific abilities, the improved lock-on system as well as the level-design, which demands players a new and more cautious approach towards dangers. However, she criticized the occasionally frustrating levels. She summarized the review by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is a great game and a worthy sequel. It's more confident in its style, storytelling ability, and level design than the first game."" Alex Carlson from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4.5/5, praising its seedy and visceral art design and its improvement on its predecessors gameplay, but criticized its adherence to the established formula. He summed up the review saying """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is purposely discomforting and hypnotically visceral. It's one of the best games released so far this year."""
"Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com gave the game a 7/10, while praising the narrative as well as the brutal violence featured in the game, which he stated ""has tread a fine, sophisticated line between titillation, power, and reflection, an integral part of both narrative and mechanics."", he criticized the oversized maps, as well as the game for being overly difficult, frustrating as enemy attack players where they can't be seen from the camera angle, and restrictive as the game forced players to play a certain way very often. Chris Thursten from PC Gamer gave the game a 57/100, criticizing the meaningless characters, alienating rape scene, rigid playstyle restriction, inconsistent AI, frustrating and unavoidable death as well as technical issues. Yet he still praised the soundtrack, where the ""experience is enormously enhanced by their work"". He summarized the review by saying that ""Restrictive design decisions sap the energy from a series that revels in it, and technical issues deal the killing blow."""
"The demo shown at Rezzed and the 2013 Penny Arcade Expo featured gameplay in the tutorial that had players appear to attempt to assault a woman sexually as the Pig Butcher. The player character lowered his pants and straddled the woman before the scene is interrupted by the director of ""Midnight Animal"", revealing the whole sequence to be a film shoot."
"Video game journalists, including Cara Ellison of ""PC Gamer"", spoke out against the usage of sexual assault imagery. In response, Dennis Wedin stated that Dennaton cut the scene from the demo, and that they were reconsidering putting the scene into the final game. Wedin also stated that they cut the scene short to show that that type of violence is not what the ""Hotline Miami"" series is about."
"On 15 January 2015 it was reported that because of the implied rape scene, the game had been refused classification in Australia, which prohibits sale within the country, effectively preventing its wide release there. In an official statement from Devolver Digital and Dennaton Games the creators mentioned that they have added a cut and uncut option for the slasher-flick level. Dennaton also reconfirmed that the context of the scene is important and that they were ""concerned and disappointed"" by the actions of the Classification Board, stating it stretched the facts in its judgment of the game. The statement concluded with Dennaton confirming that they will not challenge the ruling. Developer Dennaton Games have since suggested that people in Australia interested in the game should pirate it if they are unable to purchase a retail copy."
"With the release of the Nintendo Switch ""Hotline Miami Collection"" in August 2019, the game was no longer banned in Australia, with a new rating MA15+. According to Devolver, they had applied for a International Age Rating Coalition process for the collection as part of the requirement for publishing on the Switch. Though originally denied a rating one time, they successfully obtained the appropriate rating on a second submission. Devolver states that this automated rated may still end up challenged by the Australian board later."

While The American is the legal successor to the old Big East, the rights to conference tournament in Madison Square Garden were retained by the new Big East, so the 2014 tournament was numbered as the new conference's first edition. The tournament was held March 12–15 in the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee and decided a champion of the 2013–14 American Athletic Conference men's basketball season (like most NCAA conferences, The American recognizes both regular-season and tournament champions; Cincinnati and Louisville shared the regular-season title). The teams in the conference competed in a ten-team single-elimination tournament for an automatic bid to the 2014 NCAA Tournament."
"In the 2013–14 season, The American consisted of 10 members involved in the rearrangement of conferences between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. (Cincinnati, Connecticut, and South Florida) had been full members of the original Big East. One (Temple) had been a football-only Big East member before entering into full membership in The American. The remaining four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) had previously been members of Conference USA."
"All teams in the American qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded based on conference record and then a tie breaker system was used. Teams seeded 7–10 had to play in the opening round and teams seeded 1–6 received a bye to the second round. Louisville and Cincinnati finished with identical 15-3 records and shared the regular season title. Since the Cardinals and Bearcats had split their meetings during the regular season, a coin toss was held to determine the #1 seed in the tournament, which was won by Cincinnati."
All tournament games are nationally televised on an ESPN network:

Among his many scientific contributions is the development of the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model of carcinogenesis, also known as the Moolgavkar-Venzon-Knudson (MVK) model, a stochastic cell-level description of carcinogenesis based on Alfred G. Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis. In its original development the TSCE model represents tumor initiation as the first hit, followed by cell proliferation (clonal expansion) and malignant transformation as the second hit. It has been interpreted as describing the initiation-promotion-progression sequence observed in chemical carcinogenesis and has been applied widely for the analysis of both experimental and epidemiological data for purposes of quantitative risk assessment."

The Honda NS125 was first presented at the Bologna Motor Show in December 1984 and went on sale in April 1985.
"The engine is a liquid cooled, , two-stroke which used Honda's ATAC system (Automatically Controlled Torque Amplification Chamber). However the ATAC equipped models were not available in the UK. The NS was Honda's first attempt at the high end ""125cc"" sports bike market in Italy; therefore it was built in Atessa, Italy and many of the parts used were made by well known Italian brands such as Dell'Orto for the carburetor, Marzocchi forks and single rear shock and Grimeca wheels and front disk brake. Honda, Japan supplied the spec sheets and a few parts like the electrics, piston and barrel."
"The Honda NS125 which was available as an ""F"" naked, or an ""R"" fully faired is commonly mistaken as an older NSR, although it shares no real parts or design to it. This model is most easily identifiable by its singular square headlight, rather than the later NSR's 'foxeye' design"

"According to Jackson ""Jack Da Wack"" Tally, who was also one of B97 FM's first Bee Jocks, in early November 1979, the station slowly started to work more Top 40 music into the playlist and scaled back the rhythmic titles. By the end of that year, the staff was ready for the format change to B97 FM. This station would be a popular Top 40 outlet for years to come, much like ""The Mighty 690, WTIX"" was in the 1960s and 1970s."
"Kent Burkhart, consultant to EZ Communications at the time, states on his website that Dan Vallie was hired on by the company to change the ailing format of WEZB from disco and dance music to Top 40. Over the years, the name went through minor changes (i.e., ""The New B97 FM"", ""New Orleans' B97 FM"", ""B97 FM"", ""97.1 The All New B-97 FM"", and ""B97 FM, All The Hits!""), the transmitting power was increased, and the antenna was moved to a taller location."
"B97 has been New Orleans' top rated Top 40 outlet for more than 40 years, except for two brief, failed experiments. The first format change was a decision by now-defunct EZ Communications, in which the station changed to a hot talk format in the summer of 1994. It featured ""The Howard Stern Show"" and other edgy talk programs. The decision to return to a music format came in Spring 1996. On June 7, 1996, the station stunted by playing Billy Ray Cyrus' ""Achy Breaky Heart"" repeatedly for seven hours. At noon that day, the station launched a hot adult contemporary - Adult Top 40 format using the same name ""B97 FM."" The first song was Hootie & the Blowfish's ""Only Wanna Be With You"". On July 26, 1998, B97 FM returned to its heritage Top 40 contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. The station became more Rhythmic in its musical style. Then in 2002, it returned to its current, true Top 40 approach."
"In 1999, WEZB was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications. Clear Channel later changed its name to the current iHeartMedia."

= = = In commendam = = =
"In canon law, commendam (or in commendam) was a form of transferring an ecclesiastical benefice ""in trust"" to the ""custody"" of a patron. The phrase ""in commendam"" was originally applied to the provisional occupation of an ecclesiastical benefice, which was temporarily without an actual occupant, in contrast to the conferral of a title, ""in titulum"", which was applied to the regular and unconditional occupation of a benefice."
"The word ""commendam"" is the accusative singular of the Latin noun ""commenda"", ""trust"", or ""custody"", which is derived from the verb ""commendare"" (""to entrust"")."
"Granting a benefice ""in commendam"" became most common with monasteries, and the commendatory abbot drew a portion of the revenue of the monastery but without fulfilling the duties of the abbot or even residing at the monastery."
"The establishment of ecclesiastical benefices was a way of guaranteeing the financial stability of the Church. Real property and other goods donated to the Church were erected as a stable fund, and the revenue was attached to a particular office. The parish priest, bishop, or other minister would have the right to receive the income of the benefice to support himself and to cover the expenses related to his ministry."
"There is clear evidence that the granting of a benefice ""in commendam"" was practiced in the fourth century. In a letter written around 379, Ambrose mentions a church which he gave ""in commendam"", while he was Bishop of Milan: """"Commendo tibi, fili, Ecclesiam quae est ad Forum Cornelii ... donec ei ordinetur episcopus"""" (""I entrust unto thee, my son, the church which is at the Cornelian Forum ... while [the bishop is allotted to it]"")."
"Temporarily unoccupied church property (ecclesiastical benefice) could be entrusted to the protection of a member of the church, to safeguard and manage it until order was restored and a new permanent holder of the position was granted ""in titulum"". The patron would receive any revenues generated from the property in the meantime. Each of the early basilicas of Rome was under the guardianship of a patron."
"The benefice held ""in commendam"" could be used to provide a temporary administrator to a church or monastery that was at risk of financial ruin. It also provided a steady income for whoever was nominated, and St. Gregory the Great (590-604) gave vacant monasteries ""in commendam"" to bishops who had been driven from their sees by the invading barbarians, or whose own churches were too poor to furnish them a decent livelihood."
"In the eighth century, the practice became widely abused when kings claimed the right to appoint abbots ""in commendam"" over monasteries, often nominating their own vassals, who were not monks but laymen, as a way of rewarding them. These abbots did not have spiritual care of the monks but did have the right to manage the temporal affairs of the monastery, and some were driven into financial ruin."
"When in 1122 the Investiture Controversy was settled in favor of the church, the appointment of laymen as abbots ""in commendam"" was abolished. Clergy, however, could still be appointed as commendatory abbots, and the practice was used to provide an income to a professor, student, priest, or cardinal. This cleric would name another man to fulfill the daily responsibilities of the office."
"The practice was open to abuse: favored cardinals began to receive multiple benefices, accepting them like absentee landlords, increasing their personal possessions to the detriment of the Church. The arrangements were no longer temporary and could be held for a lifetime. Monastic communities, from which these grants were taken, lost revenues and gained nothing in return, suffering from spiritual and temporal mismanagement."
"In 16th-century France, however, the Kings continued to appoint abbots and the nomination of the King’s close relatives to office became commonplace particularly in La Chaise-Dieu."
"Following the Second Vatican Council, the Church drastically reformed and, in most cases, completely abolished the system of benefices."
"In the Church of England the stipends of bishops and other senior ecclesiastics were sometimes augmented by the stipends of sinecure benefices held ""in commendam"". In 1719 Hugh Boulter succeeded to the deanery of Christ Church, which he held ""in commendam"" with the bishopric of Bristol."
"These were made illegal by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1836 (c.77), section 18, which is still in force. The Act does not extend to the Isle of Man, but similar provision with respect to the bishop of Sodor and Man was made by the Sodor and Man Act 1838 (c.30), section 3."
= = = N-Nitrosonornicotine = = =
"""N""-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN) is a tobacco-specific nitrosamine produced during the curing and processing of tobacco. It has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Although no adequate studies of the relationship between exposure to NNN and human cancer have been reported, there is sufficient evidence that NNN causes cancer in experimental animals."
"NNN is found in a variety of tobacco products including smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco and snuff, cigarettes, and cigars. It is present in smoke from cigars and cigarettes, in the saliva of people who chew betel quid with tobacco, and in the saliva of oral-snuff and e-cigarette users. NNN is produced by the nitrosation of nornicotine during the curing, aging, processing, and smoking of tobacco. Roughly half of the NNN originates in the unburnt tobacco, with the remainder being formed during burning."
"NNN can be produced in the acidic environment of the stomach in users of oral nicotine replacement therapies, due to the combination of dietary/endogenous nitrates, and nornicotine(either present as a minor metabolite of nicotine, or as an impurity in the product)."
"NNN is metabolized by Cytochrome P450, which adds a hydroxy group to either the 2' or 5' carbon on the 5-membered ring. 2'-hydroxylation appears more prevalent in humans, while 5'-hydroxylation is more prevalent in non-primate animals. Upon hydroxylation, the 5-membered ring opens up, allowing the compound to bind to the base of one of the nucleotides."
"NNN is a derivative of nicotine that is produced in the Curing of tobacco, in the burning of tobacco (such as with cigarettes), and in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nicotine is converted into Nornicotine via Nicotine N-Demethylase (NND), an enzyme found in the tobacco plant that works by removing the methyl group from the nitrogen on the 5-membered ring of nicotine. From there, Nornicotine undergoes nitrosation (the conversion of organic compounds into nitroso derivatives by gaining a Nitrosonium (N=O) group) on that same nitrogen, converting it to NNN."
The nitrosonium group forms from Nitrous acid (HNO) under acidic conditions present in the tobacco curing process. It can also be formed in the stomach when stomach acid reacts with nitrite ions that are typically used as a salt to preserve red meats and inhibit bacterial growth. Nitrous acid becomes protonated on its hydroxy group to form nitrosooxonium. This compound then splits off to form nitrosonium and water.
"It is important to maintain bioswales to ensure the best possible efficiency and effectiveness in removal of pollutants from stormwater runoff. Planning for maintenance is an important step, which can include the introduction of filters or large rocks to prevent clogging. Annual maintenance through soil testing, visual inspection, and mechanical testing is also crucial to the health of a bioswale."
"Bioswales are commonly applied along streets and around parking lots, where substantial automotive pollution settles on the pavement and is flushed by the first instance of rain, known as the first flush. Bioswales, or other types of biofilters, can be created around the edges of parking lots to capture and treat stormwater runoff before releasing it to the watershed or storm sewer."
"Bioswales work to remove pollutants through vegetation and the soil. As the storm water runoff flows through the bioswale, the pollutants are captured and settled by the leaves and stems of the plants. The pollutants then enter the soil where they decompose or can be broken down by bacteria in healthy soil."
"There are several classes of water pollutants that may be collected or arrested with bioswales. These fall into the categories of silt, inorganic contaminants, organic chemicals and pathogens."
"Bioswales can be implemented in areas that require stormwater management to regulate the runoff velocity and decontaminate the runoff. Bioswales are created to handle the first flush of pollutants during the event of rain, therefore, locations that have high areas of impervious surface such as roads, parking lots, or rooftops can benefit from additions of bioswales. They can also be integrated into road medians, curb cutouts, sidewalks, or any public space."
"Bioswales are useful low-impact development work to decrease the velocity of stormwater runoff while removing pollutants from the discharge. They are extremely beneficial in protecting surface water and local waterways from excessive pollution from stormwater runoff. The longer the runoff stays within the bioswale, the better the pollutant removal outcome. It is also beneficial in removing standing ponds that could potentially attract mosquitos. Bioswales can also be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and attract animals and create habitats. Bioswales can also be beneficial for groundwater recharge."
"Improper maintenance can lead to high restoration costs to address inefficient bioswales. An accumulation of large sediments, trash, and improper growth of vegetation can all affect the quality and performance of bioswales. It is beneficial at the planning stages to set apart easements to allow for easier maintenance of biowales, whether it be adequate space to locate machinery or safety to those working. Different types of filters can be used to catch sediments. Grass filter strips or rock inlets can be used to filter sediments and particulates; however, without proper maintenance, runoff could flow away from the bioswales due to blockage. Structural inlets have become more common due to the ease of maintenance, use, and its effectiveness. Avoiding the use of floating mulch and selecting the best fit low-maintenance plants ensure better efficiency in the bioswales. Depending on a community's needs for a bioswale, a four step assessment program can be developed. Visual inspection, capacity testing, synthetic runoff, and monitoring are the four steps that can be used to evaluate performance and maintenance of bioswales."
"Routine inspection is required to ensure that the performance and aesthetics of bioswales are not compromised. Time and frequency of inspections vary based on different local governments, but should occur at least once a year. Various aspects of inspection can take place, either visually or mechanically. Visual observation of the vegetation, water, and inlets are all crucial to ensure performance. Some organizations utilize checklists to streamline the visual inspection process."
There are different methods to determine if a bioswale needs maintenance. Bioswales are benchmarked to meet a specific level of infiltration to determine if maintenance is required. A staff gauge is used to measure the infiltration rate. Soil chemistry testing is also required to determine if the soil has a certain off-level of any pollutant. Phosphorus and high levels of salinity in the soil are two common pollutants that should be attended to. Analysis of inflow and outflow pollutant concentration is also another way to determine the performance level of bioswales.
"Maintenance can span to three different levels of care. Aesthetic maintenance is required to remove weeds that affect the performance of the other plants and the bioswale itself, clean and remove trash, and maintaining the looks of the vegetation. Partial restoration is needed when the inlet is blocked by sediments or when vegetation needs to be replaced. Full restoration is required when the bioswales no longer filter pollutants adequately and overall performance is severely lacking."
"Bioswales experience short, potentially intense, periods of rain, flooding and pollutant loading followed by dry seasons. It is important to take into account how the vegetation selected for the bioswales will grow and understanding what types of plants are considered the best fit."
There are four types of bioswales that can be constructed based on the needs of the location.
Bioswales require a certain soil composition that does not contain more than 5% clay. The soil itself before implementation should not be contaminated. Bioswales should be constructed with a longitudinal slope to allow sediments to settle. Maximum slope of bioswales is 3:1. A minimum clearance is required to ensure that other infrastructure would not be damaged. The overfill drain should be located at least 6 inches above the ground plain to allow for maximum concentration time of stormwater runoff in the bioswales. Rocks can also be used to slow down the runoff velocity. The use of filters is important to prevent inlets from becoming blocked by sediments or trash.
"Two early examples of scientifically designed bioswales for large scale applications are found in the western US. In 1996 for Willamette River Park in Portland, Oregon a total of 2330 lineal feet of bioswale was designed and installed to capture and prevent pollutant runoff from entering the Willamette River. Intermittent check dams were installed to further abet silt capture, which reduced by 50% suspended solids entering the river system."
"A second example of a large scale designed bioswale is at the Carneros Business Park, Sonoma County, California. Starting in 1997 the project design team worked with the California Department of Fish and Game and County of Sonoma to produce a detailed design to channel surface runoff at the perimeter of a large parking area. Surface runoff consists of building roof runoff, parking lot runoff and overland flow from properties to the north of the project site. A total of two lineal miles of bioswale was designed into the project. The purpose of the bioswale was to minimize runoff contaminants from entering Sonoma Creek. The bioswale channel is grass-lined, and nearly linear in form. Downslope gradient is approximately 4% and cross-slope gradient is approximately 6%."
"A relatively recent project established was the Seattle, Washington Street Edge Alternatives project, completed in 2001. Rather than using traditional piping, SEA's goal was to create a natural landscape that represented what the area was like before development. The street was 11% more pervious than a standard street and was characterized with evergreen trees and bioswales. The bioswales were planted on graded slopes with wetland and upland plants. Other landscaping also focused on native and salmon-friendly plants. SEA provided a strong benefit for stormwater runoff mitigation that helped continue to protect Seattle's creek ecology. The project street also created a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing site as opposed to hard landscaping."

"The annual season of the live events at Symphony Space begins in the mid-fall and ends in mid-spring. There is a theme to each Selected Shorts episode and performance. Several stories are presented around each theme. The stories are always fiction, sometimes classic, sometimes new, always performed by actors from stage, screen and television who bring these short stories to life. Evenings are often co-hosted by writers, literary producers, and other interesting characters."

"Symphony Space's Artistic Director Isaiah Sheffer formerly hosted the live events, although many Selected Shorts also feature guest hosts, often well-known writers, who also choose which stories will be read. Mr. Sheffer died on November 9, 2012 at age 76. Actor BD Wong acts as the host of the live events since the fall of 2012."
"The readings are recorded live and become the basis of a one-hour radio program, hosted by actors, authors, and entertainers such as David Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Cynthia Nixon, Wyatt Cenac, and Jane Kaczmarek, with literary commentator Hannah Tinti of One Story Magazine, and are produced in conjunction with WNYC. The programs are distributed by Public Radio International and air on PRI-affiliated public radio stations in the United States. The radio program airs weekly throughout the year."
"Originally, the program was distributed by National Public Radio. However, in October 2007, it moved its distribution to PRI, Public Radio International."
"The program's theme is David Peterson's ""That's the Deal,"" performed by the Deardorf/Peterson group. Until 2011, the radio show began and ended with the piano and cello duet ""Come to the Meadow"" by Roger Kellaway."

Some of the Powell-Cotton films are shown as part of the permanent exhibition at the Powell-Cotton Museum.
The Angolan film collection by the Powell-Cotton sisters was also the focus of the special exhibition ‘Tala! Visions of Angola’ which was held at the Powell-Cotton Museum from May to November 2012.
"The exhibition was awarded National Lottery Heritage Funding and was co-curated with the Angolan Cultural Foundation and the Angolan Embassy. Commenting on the exhibition, the curators said:"
"“The objects we had access to, were made by somebody’s great grandmother or great grandfather. They deserve to be seen and remembered by their rightful ancestors as well as the wider public. Just as importantly, the Angolan community here in the UK have a right to be involved in the decisions made about the collection. This is after all their history.”"
"In connection with the exhibition, a research project entitled ‘Looking Back to Find Them Looking Forward: The Visionary Powell-Cotton Sisters’ and was in collaboration with the Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford."
"The project and exhibition aimed to highlight the importance of the daughters collecting practises and material they brought back, especially their ethnographic films. As Oxford Aspire stated in an article on the project;"
"‘The sisters’ collecting practice was visionary in that it placed photography and film-making in a central role in the collection of material culture, something few other museum collections were doing at the time. As a result their collection represents a significant part of the film and museum heritage of the county. Until this new project, however, their achievements were not recognised in the galleries of the Powell-Cotton Museum.’"

= = = Gunpoint (video game) = = =
"Gunpoint is a stealth-based puzzle-platform video game created by indie developer Tom Francis. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 3 June 2013, and soon followed with versions for OS X and Linux."
"The game is set in the near future and sees players assume the role of freelance spy Richard Conway, who is tasked with infiltrating buildings to fulfil assignments from various clients. To do so, the player must avoid guards and bypass security features with the aid of a number of high-tech gadgets, such as the Crosslink tool which is used to rewire electrical circuits. Throughout the game, Conway seeks to clear his name in the murder of a high-profile weapons manufacturer, and gradually uncovers a murder mystery in his search for the real killer."
"""Gunpoint"" is divided into a number of missions, between which the player, as Richard Conway, interacts with others through a PDA to accept missions, shop for new gear, and allocate resource points among various abilities Conway possesses. Each mission typically involves entering a building and hack into a computer, and then making way for the exit point of the level. Initially missions are provided in a linear order but the game provides optional missions later."
"The building is presented in a two-dimensional cross-section on screen, showing the locations of guards, doors, switch panels, lights, security cameras, and other features, including the target objectives. The player, as Conway, can run and climb on walls, use stairwells and elevators, and using the abilities of Conway's ""Bullfrog"" hypertrousers, can launch the character great heights or distances, potentially tackling guards or breaking through glass walls. Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player to stay out of the guards' line of sight."
"Within a few missions, the player gains access to the Crosslink device. This allows the player to change the view to show all the security features of the building and their current connectivity, such as the light controlled by a given light switch. From here, the player can rewire these controls, within the current limits of the Crosslink, such as by making a light switch control a secured door, or by completely disabling a security feature. The availability of which controls can be affected is initially limited at the start of the game, but as the player earns in-game money, they can buy improved features, such as being able to control encrypted controls or even affect weapons carried by guards. With the Crosslink, the player can then create situations that would allow them to sneak through without being detected by guards, lure the guards into areas where they can be neutralized, or simply to gain access to secured areas of the facility. Other tools to help navigate the building and avoid guards become available to purchase later. The player is ranked at the end of each mission based on time taken, number of guards knocked out/killed, number of times they were spotted, and how much noise or distraction they created."
The game includes a level editor to allow players to create their own challenges.
"""Gunpoint"" was developed by Tom Francis in his spare time while working as section editor for ""PC Gamer UK"" magazine. Francis had no formal background in programming, but having learned that ""Spelunky"" was created by one person with the user-friendly software suite , he decided to experiment with game development. He started work on his first game, under the working title ""Private Dick"", in May 2010. Within about a month Francis had a working prototype which he released on his blog to gauge interest and garner feedback."
"After making further progress on the game's core mechanics, Francis requested on his blog that interested artists submit character and background mockups for the game to replace his programmer art. He described the response as ""humbling and overwhelming,"" and ultimately chose to work with artists John Roberts and Fabian van Dommelen. Francis then repeated this process for musicians, recruiting Ryan Ike, Francisco Cerda, and John Robert Matz to create the background music of ""Gunpoint""."
"The concept for ""Gunpoint"" came from Francis' review work for ""PC Gamer UK"", as he found himself often writing means of suggesting how games could be improved, and considered himself too harsh for writing such criticism. He wanted to make a game that avoided the pitfall of assuming ""the player is stupid"", and instead not worry about if the player out-thought his own level design. The idea of the Crosslink tool made it effectively a type of limited level editor to let the player complete each level in the manner they wanted to. Francis considered that the stealth element was less about evasion and more on simply avoiding being even seen by the guards; he considered that for most other games, player characters can typically take a great deal of damage, and instead wanted to make the player consider the guards' guns as serious threats and included instant death if seen by the guards. The Crosslink tool could thus allow players to deal with such guards without even being in the same room. Francis did cut out one element of the Crosslink tool that would allow the player to remotely activate a device that is on an accessible circuit as he felt this would make for trivial solutions."
"In 2015, the game was ported by Abstraction Games to a newer version of the game engine, with added support for Steam Workshop."
"""Gunpoint"" was positively received by critics, attaining a score of 83/100 from review aggregator Metacritic. The game was widely praised for its gameplay, art style, music, and writing; while its short length was a common criticism. Eurogamer awarded the game 8/10 and wrote ""'Always leave them wanting more,' goes the old showbiz adage, and ""Gunpoint"" certainly does that."" GameSpot's review was more critical of the game's length, awarding it 7.5/10 and describing it as ""the start of something great, but without more content, it feels too much like the appetizer to a main course."" Destructoid gave the game 9.5/10 and called it ""a hallmark of excellence,"" noting that ""its short length might be seen as a flaw, but a robust level editor soundly nips that issue in the bud."" ""PC Gamer UK"", where Francis worked while developing the game, declined to review it in order to avoid any perceived conflict of interest."
"Francis noted that his only development cost was $30 for a version of . He recouped this cost within 64 seconds of offering pre-orders for the game, but since has made revenue many times more than this and recognizing he was making enough to become a game developer. With the success of ""Gunpoint"", Francis announced that he would be departing ""PC Gamer UK"" to take up full-time independent game development, while still writing freelance for the magazine from time to time."

The construction is overseen by Omer Ilknur and was to include a 4-star hotel, a casino, residences, social facilities, shops, offices, cafes, restaurants, and bars."
"As of May 2019, the Government of Georgia sold the Babillon Tower multi-story building to MC Construction, located in the center of Batumi.

Babylon Tower was supposed to be completed in 2015, but the developer of the project TAM GEO LLC did not fulfill their obligations."
"The battlefield fell silent around 10:30 p.m., except for the cries of the wounded and dying. Gen. Meade telegraphed to General-in-Chief Henry Halleck in Washington:"
"Meade made his decision late that night in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There is some evidence that Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, ""If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre."""
"There was considerably less confidence in Confederate headquarters that night. The army had suffered a significant defeat by not dislodging their enemy. A staff officer remarked that Lee was ""not in good humor over the miscarriage of his plans and his orders."" But in Lee's report, he showed more optimism:"
"Years later, Longstreet would write that his troops on the second day had done the ""best three hours' fighting done by any troops on any battle-field."" That night he continued to advocate for a strategic movement around the Union left flank, but Lee would hear none of it. He sent orders to Richard Ewell to ""assail the enemy's right"" at daylight, and he ordered Jeb Stuart (who had finally arrived at Lee's headquarters early that afternoon) to operate on Ewell's left and rear."
"Casualty figures for the second day of Gettysburg are difficult to assess because both armies reported by unit after the full battle, not by day. One estimate is that the Confederates lost approximately 6,000 killed, missing, or wounded from Hood's, McLaws's, and Anderson's divisions, amounting to 30–40% casualties. Union casualties in these actions probably exceeded 9,000. An estimate for the day's total (including the Culp's and Cemetery Hill actions) by historian Noah Trudeau is 10,000 Union, 6,800 Confederate. This is in comparison to approximately 9,000 Union and 6,000 Confederate casualties on the first day, although there were much larger percentages of the armies engaged the second. Some estimates of total casualties for the day run as high as 20,000 and declare it the bloodiest day of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a testament to the ferocity of the day's battle that such high casualties figures resulted even with much of the fighting not occurring until late in the afternoon and thereafter lasting about six hours. By comparison, the Battle of Antietam—known famously as the bloodiest single day in American military history with nearly 23,000 casualties—was an engagement that lasted twelve hours, or about twice as long."
"On the night of July 2, all of the remaining elements of both armies had arrived: Stuart's cavalry and Pickett's division for the Confederates and John Sedgwick's Union VI Corps. The stage was set for the bloody climax of the three-day battle."
= = = SystemVerilog = = =
"SystemVerilog, standardized as IEEE 1800, is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard. It is commonly used in the semiconductor and electronic design industry as an evolution of Verilog."
"SystemVerilog started with the donation of the Superlog language to Accellera in 2002 by the startup company Co-Design Automation. The bulk of the verification functionality is based on the OpenVera language donated by Synopsys. In 2005, SystemVerilog was adopted as IEEE Standard 1800-2005. In 2009, the standard was merged with the base Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005) standard, creating IEEE Standard 1800-2009. The current version is IEEE standard 1800-2017."
The feature-set of SystemVerilog can be divided into two distinct roles:
The remainder of this article discusses the features of SystemVerilog not present in Verilog-2005.
"There are two types of data lifetime specified in SystemVerilog: static and automatic. Automatic variables are created the moment program execution comes to the scope of the variable. Static variables are created at the start of the program's execution and keep the same value during the entire program's lifespan, unless assigned a new value during execution."
"Any variable that is declared inside a task or function without specifying type will be considered automatic. To specify that a variable is static place the ""codice_1"" keyword in the declaration before the type, e.g., ""codice_2"". The ""codice_3"" keyword is used in the same way."
"Enhanced variable types add new capability to Verilog's ""reg"" type:"
"Verilog-1995 and -2001 limit reg variables to behavioral statements such as RTL code. SystemVerilog extends the reg type so it can be driven by a single driver such as gate or module. SystemVerilog names this type ""logic"" to remind users that it has this extra capability and is not a hardware register. The names ""logic"" and ""reg"" are interchangeable. A signal with more than one driver (such as a tri-state buffer for general-purpose input/output) needs to be declared a net type such as ""wire"" so SystemVerilog can resolve the final value."
"Multidimensional packed arrays unify and extend Verilog's notion of ""registers"" and ""memories"":"
"Classical Verilog permitted only one dimension to be declared to the left of the variable name. SystemVerilog permits any number of such ""packed"" dimensions. A variable of packed array type maps 1:1 onto an integer arithmetic quantity. In the example above, each element of codice_4 may be used in expressions as a six-bit integer. The dimensions to the right of the name (32 in this case) are referred to as ""unpacked"" dimensions. As in Verilog-2001, any number of unpacked dimensions is permitted."
"Enumerated data types (codice_5) allow numeric quantities to be assigned meaningful names. Variables declared to be of enumerated type cannot be assigned to variables of a different enumerated type without casting. This is not true of parameters, which were the preferred implementation technique for enumerated quantities in Verilog-2005:"
"As shown above, the designer can specify an underlying arithmetic type (codice_6 in this case) which is used to represent the enumeration value. The meta-values X and Z can be used here, possibly to represent illegal states. The built-in function codice_7 returns an ASCII string for the current enumerated value, which is useful in validation and testing."
"New integer types: SystemVerilog defines codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11 as two-state signed integral types having 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively. A codice_12 type is a variable-width two-state type that works much like codice_13. Two-state types lack the X and Z metavalues of classical Verilog; working with these types may result in faster simulation."
"Structures and unions work much like they do in the C programming language. SystemVerilog enhancements include the packed attribute and the tagged attribute. The codice_14 attribute allows runtime tracking of which member(s) of a union are currently in use. The codice_15 attribute causes the structure or union to be mapped 1:1 onto a packed array of bits. The contents of codice_16 data types occupy a continuous block of memory with no gaps, similar to bitfields in C and C++:"
"As shown in this example, SystemVerilog also supports typedefs, as in C and C++."
"SystemVerilog introduces three new procedural blocks intended to model hardware: codice_17 (to model combinational logic), codice_18 (for flip-flops), and codice_19 (for latches). Whereas Verilog used a single, general-purpose codice_20 block to model different types of hardware structures, each of SystemVerilog's new blocks is intended to model a specific type of hardware, by imposing semantic restrictions to ensure that hardware described by the blocks matches the intended usage of the model. An HDL compiler or verification program can take extra steps to ensure that only the intended type of behavior occurs."
An codice_17 block models combinational logic. The simulator infers the sensitivity list to be all variables from the contained statements:
"An codice_19 block is meant to infer a level-sensitive latch. Again, the sensitivity list is inferred from the code:"
An codice_18 block is meant to model synchronous logic (especially edge-sensitive sequential logic):
"Electronic design automation (EDA) tools can verify the design's intent by checking that the hardware model does not violate any block usage semantics. For example, the new blocks restrict assignment to a variable by allowing only one source, whereas Verilog's codice_20 block permitted assignment from multiple procedural sources."
"For small designs, the Verilog ""port"" compactly describes a module's connectivity with the surrounding environment. But major blocks within a large design hierarchy typically possess port counts in the thousands. SystemVerilog introduces concept of interfaces to both reduce the redundancy of port-name declarations between connected modules, as well as group and abstract related signals into a user-declared bundle. Additional concept is modport, that shows direction of logic connections."
Example:
"The following verification features are typically not synthesizable, meaning they cannot be implemented in hardware based on HDL code. Instead, they assist in the creation of extensible, flexible test benches."
"Melica schafkatii, is a species of grass that can be found in Central Asia."
The species is perennial and have elongated rhizomes. The plant stem is smooth with the culms being long. The species leaf-sheaths are tubular with one of their length being closed. It eciliate membrane is truncate with its leaf-blades being long and wide and have acuminated apex.
"The panicle itself is contacted, lanceolate and is long. The main branches are distant and are long. The spikelets are elliptic, solitary, long, and are made out of 2 fertile florets. Fertile spikelets are pediceled, the pedicels of which are filiform, pubescent and curved. Florets are diminished at the apex."
"Its lemma have pilose surface and obtuse apex with fertile lemma being chartaceous, ovate, keelless, and is long. Both the lower and upper glumes are long, are keelless, oblong, and 5–7 -veined with obtuse apexes. Palea is 2-veined. Flowers are fleshy, oblong, truncate, have 2 lodicules, and grow together. They have 3 anthers which are long that have fruits which are caryopsis and have an additional pericarp with linear hilum."
= = = Mangrove Care Forum Bali = = =
"Mangrove Care Forum Bali (MCFB), also known as Forum Peduli Mangrove Bali (FPMB), is formed with the aim to protect, preserve, rehabilitate, replant and educate, as a concerted effort to save the mangroves. Supported by the Artha Graha Peduli Foundation, the team at the Mangrove Care Forum Bali draws from 16 years of experience the foundation has in caring for and operating the Tambling Wildlife Nature Conservation Park, located at South Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, within 356,000 hectares of Tropical Rainforest and 21,600 hectares of Marine Nature Reserve."
"The mangrove forest under the care of The Mangrove Care Forum Bali is located in the Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park, a 1,373.5 hectare mangrove forest at the Benoa Bay Area in Bali. The mangrove forest suffers from severe pollution and misuse, & debris and rubbish from nearby villages. Deforestation of trees and littering its grounds are a common sight. The focus of the Mangrove Care Forum Bali is to involve the communities surrounding the mangrove and enlist regular help to clean up and create a safe environment for plants and marine life to thrive. A further goal is to prevent further abrasion of coastline and to regrow the affected areas to lush mangrove vegetation."
"Initiated by Tomy Winata at the start of 2013, the Mangrove Care Forum Bali is established in partnership with:"
"Cristiano Ronaldo, the famous Portuguese footballer, has been appointed the ambassador for this movement to conserve mangrove by the Mangrove Care Forum Bali. He came on board because of the mangrove forests’ ability to help buffer against tsunamis, a cause he dearly supports after witnessing first-hand the devastation of the tsunamis when he visited Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. He met up with the 8-year-old boy who was found alive after 19 days at sea, dragged out by the unforgiving tsunami, wearing a Portuguese football jersey. survived on puddled water and dried noodles and was reunited with his father and grandfather. His story was later recounted in a book published by Radio 68H ‘Lolos dari Maut Tsunami’."
"The Benoa Bay mangrove forest is both primary and secondary vegetation, meaning parts of it have never been cleared or removed while parts have regrown after the natural and human assisted destruction of the original vegetation. It suffered damage from pollution and construction projects. Mangrove forests can serve as a natural barrier to tidal erosions, and are oxygen providers and a safe haven to many species. The Mangrove Care Forum Bali helps to conserve and nurture life along this coastal sanctuary, and has set 5 key goals in furthering its efforts:"
"The Mangrove Care Forum Bali aims increase community awareness regarding the preservation of the Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park in the long. Education plays a part and the Mangrove Care Forum Bali plans to start an Early Environment Education programme. This activity is targeted at students from elementary level to high school, and plans to reach out to communities around the Benoa Bay area. The methodology and materials of environment education will be adapted to local context (language, case studies and photos) and be part of the regular school curriculum. The Mangrove Care Forum Bali, in collaboration with Universities, Ministry of Forestry and experts in the conservation fields, will develop modules that can be incorporated and accepted by all levels of participants."
"The programme to clean up the beaches had already started in March 2013 with daily activities involving students and the community at large, with the aim of reaching 1,373.5 hectares of mangrove in 5 villages in Benoa Bay."
"Indonesia is an archipelagic country with more than 17,000 islands and 95,181 km of coastline, of which about 6,000 islands are inhabited by over 238 million people. In the 1980s, there are more than 4.2 million hectares of mangroves but half of that coverage has been lost by the end of the 1990s. For centuries, the Indonesian people have relied on the resources provided by the mangroves, for firewood, charcoal, tannin, dyes, food and beverages, medicine, pole and timber. In the early days of commercialization, fishing and charcoal production made the basic economic activities. Now, millions of hectares of mangrove forests are lost to agriculture, oil palm plantations and fish farms, making coastal communities vulnerable to the force of tropical storms and loss of livelihood and products."
"In 2011, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) detected 23 tropical cyclones off the coast, which produced high speed winds, heavy rains, and storm surges that caused flooding and structural damage to buildings and coastal infrastructure. Mangroves are adjacent to major landmasses and big rivers in Indonesia, and mostly found on the coasts of large islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua. The island of Java, where approximately 130 million people live, is particularly vulnerable to tropical storms."
"In 2007, the Indonesian Forestry Ministry established 2 centres for mangrove development. During 2010 and 2011, the centre on the island of Bali planted 8,000 new mangrove trees, and the other centre, in the city of Medan on the island of Sumatra, put in 10,000 new plants. These efforts paled against the continual destruction of the coastal forests in the name of urban development, mainly for agricultural expansion. The realisation and urgency that we need to step up efforts in preserving the mangrove forests is what lead to the formation of the Mangrove Care Forum Bali."
"The Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park is a vast green area located in Benoa Bay. The coast is filled with diversity in nature’s ecosystem, including but not limited to:"
Benoa Bay is a tidal estuary located on the southeast coast of Bali. The estuary is protected by the narrow sandy Benoa Peninsula which protrudes northwards from the southern tip of the harbour and which closes off the entire southern portion of the estuary. Serangan Island which is located to the north partially closes the remainder of the estuary except for a one kilometre navigable stretch of water that separates the southern tip of the island from the Benoa Peninsula. The northern tip of the island is separated from the mainland at high and mid tides by a very shallow straight which is 400 metres at its narrowest point. The entire coastline is protected by an extensive coral reef system that runs continuously apart from a very narrow (200 metre) channel at the harbour entrance at the northern tip of the Benoa Peninsula.
"The human feature of the Bay is the Benoa Port facility located on reclaimed land in the middle of the estuary, and the connecting causeway that stretches 3 kilometres north to the mainland. The causeway being a solid barrier has greatly affected the natural flushing of the bay by tide and stream discharge."
"Benoa Bay is lined with a mangrove forest that has suffered depletion due to development and land reclamation. Estimates are that 50% of the mangrove forest has been lost since 1980 as a result of development. There are many fresh water rivers flowing into the estuary, predominantly those draining the central plains and mountain ranges to the north, and to a lesser extent from the southern Bukit Plateau."
"Benoa Bay suffers from a number of serious environmental problems and in a sense, similar to other estuarine environments, is a focal point for environmental impacts that originate elsewhere in the region. These problems range from eutrophication of the estuary due to nutrient loading through to biological pollution from untreated sewage effluent discharge."
"Three of the fresh water rivers that enter Benoa Bay from the north originate in the agricultural heartland of Bali and reach the estuary after travelling through the highly populated urban centre of Denpasar. Agricultural runoff is particularly high in nutrients from fertilisers and manure from farm animals. In particular crop applications of urea, triple super phosphate and potassium chloride, as well as growth stimulant ZA are common in the catchment area. Fertilisers that are not directly absorbed in the rice fields are carried down through the irrigation system and eventually through rivers and out into the bay. All of the rivers entering the bay have large quantities of excess nutrients and the nutrient loading of the bay is evident with the visible growth of algae and uncharacteristic sea bed grasses."

"Very cheap variable capacitors are constructed from layered aluminium and plastic foils that are variably pressed together using a screw. These so-called ""squeezers"" cannot provide a stable and reproducible capacitance, however. A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and might be called a ""slider"". This has practical advantages for makeshift or home construction, and may be found in resonant-loop antennas or crystal radios."
"Small variable capacitors operated by screwdriver (for instance, to precisely set a resonant frequency at the factory and then never be adjusted again) are called trimmer capacitors. In addition to air and plastic, trimmers can also be made using a ceramic dielectric, such as mica."
"Very often, multiple stator/rotor sections are arranged behind one another on the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit. The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 × 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 × 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver. Capacitors with multiple sections often include trimmer capacitors in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency."
"A butterfly capacitor is a form of rotary variable capacitor with two independent sets of stator plates opposing each other, and a butterfly-shaped rotor arranged so that turning the rotor will vary the capacitances between the rotor and either stator equally."
"Butterfly capacitors are used in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. RF power amplifier stages in push-pull configuration or symmetrical antenna tuners where the rotor needs to be ""cold"", i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily DC) ground potential. Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in magnetic loop antennas."
"In a butterfly capacitor, the stators and each half of the rotor can only cover a maximum angle of 90° since there must be a position without rotor/stator overlap corresponding to minimum capacity, therefore a turn of only 90° covers the entire capacitance range."
"The closely related split stator variable capacitor does not have the limitation of 90° angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another. Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted on opposite sides of the rotor axis. While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180°, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the rotor axis instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane."
"Differential variable capacitors also have two independent stators, but unlike in the butterfly capacitor where capacities on both sides increase equally as the rotor is turned, in a differential variable capacitor one section's capacity will increase while the other section's decreases, keeping the stator-to-stator capacitance constant. Differential variable capacitors can therefore be used in capacitive potentiometric circuits."
The variable capacitor with air dielectric was invented by the Hungarian engineer Dezső Korda. He received a German patent for the invention on 13 December 1893.
"The thickness of the depletion layer of a reverse-biased semiconductor diode varies with the DC voltage applied across the diode. Any diode exhibits this effect (including p/n junctions in transistors), but devices specifically sold as variable capacitance diodes (also called varactors or varicaps) are designed with a large junction area and a doping profile specifically designed to maximize capacitance."
"Their use is limited to low signal amplitudes to avoid obvious distortions as the capacitance would be affected by the change of signal voltage, precluding their use in the input stages of high-quality RF communications receivers, where they would add unacceptable levels of intermodulation. At VHF/UHF frequencies, e.g. in FM Radio or TV tuners, dynamic range is limited by noise rather than large signal handling requirements, and varicaps are commonly used in the signal path."
"Varicaps are used for frequency modulation of oscillators, and to make high-frequency voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), the core component in phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers that are ubiquitous in modern communications equipment."
"BST device are based on Barium Strontium Titanate and vary the capacitance by applying high voltage to the device. They have a dedicated analogue control input and therefore introduce less non-linearities than varactor diodes, especially for higher signal voltages. The limitations for BST are stability over temperature and linearity in demanding applications."
"A digitally tuned capacitor is an IC variable capacitor based on several technologies. MEMS, BST and SOI/SOS devices are available from a number of suppliers and vary in capacitance range, quality factor and resolution for different RF tuning applications."
"MEMS devices have the highest quality factor and are highly linear, and therefore are suitable for antenna aperture tuning, dynamic impedance matching, power amplifier load matching and adjustable filters. RF tuning MEMS are still a relatively new technology and has not yet been accepted broadly."
SOI/SOS tuning devices are constructed as solid state FET switches built on insulated CMOS wafers and use MIM caps arranged in binary-weighted values to achieve different capacitance values. SOI/SOS switches have high linearity and are well suited to low power applications where high voltages are not present. High voltage endurance requires multiple FET devices in series which adds series resistance and lowers the quality factor.
"The capacitance values are designed for antenna impedance matching in multi-band LTE GSM/WCDMA cellular handsets and mobile TV receivers that operate over wide frequency ranges, such as the European DVB-H and Japanese ISDB-T mobile TV systems."
Variable capacitance is sometimes used to convert physical phenomena into electrical signals.
= = = Georg Bühler = = =
"Professor Johann Georg Bühler (July 19, 1837 – April 8, 1898) was a scholar of ancient Indian languages and law."
"Bühler was born to Rev. Johann G. Bühler in Borstel, Hanover, attended grammar school in Hanover, where he mastered Greek and Latin, then university as a student of theology and philosophy at Göttingen, where he studied classical philology, Sanskrit, Zend, Persian, Armenian, and Arabic. In 1858 he received his doctorate in eastern languages and archaeology; his thesis explored the suffix ""-tês"" in Greek grammar. That same year he went to Paris to study Sanskrit manuscripts, and in 1859 onwards to London, where he remained until October 1862. This time was used mainly for the study of the Vedic manuscripts at the India Office and the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. While in England, Bühler was first a private teacher and later (from May 1861) assistant to the Queen's librarian in Windsor Castle."
"In Fall 1862 Bühler was appointed assistant at the Göttingen library; he moved there in October. While settling in, he received an invitation via Prof. Max Müller to join the Benares Sanskrit College in India. Before this could be settled, he also received (again via Prof. Müller) an offer of Professor of Oriental Languages at the Elphinstone College, Bombay (now Mumbai). Bühler responded immediately and arrived on February 10, 1863 in Bombay. Noted Sanskrit and legal scholar Kashinath Trimbak Telang was then a student at the college. In the next year Bühler became a Fellow of Bombay University and member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was to remain in India until 1880. During this time he collected a remarkable number of texts for the Indian government and the libraries of Berlin, Cambridge University, and Oxford University."
"In the year 1878 he published his translations of the Paiyalachchhi, the oldest Prakrit dictionary, with glossary and translation. He also took responsibility for the translation of the Apastamba, Dharmasutra etc. in Professor Max Müller's monumental compilation and translation, the ""Sacred Books of the East"", vols. 2, 14, and 25."
"On 8 April 1898 Bühler drowned in Lake Constance, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Contemporary accounts mostly attributed it to an accident, but it has been speculated that it was a suicide motivated by Bühler's connections to a scandal involving his former student Alois Anton Führer."

"Kerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network at the time, was informed of the show's content by friends while having dinner. He tuned in to watch the show, which was being transmitted on TCN-9, and was so offended by its content that he phoned the studio operators and angrily shouted, ""Get that shit off the air!"""
"Within minutes, the series was pulled. After the break, the Nine Network announced that it failed to continue airing the show, purportedly due to technical difficulties, and aired reruns of the American sitcom ""Cheers"" immediately afterwards to fill in the remaining airtime. In 2008, Bert Newton justified the broadcast explanation: ""It's technically ""very"" difficult to keep a show on air with Mr. Packer on the phone, yelling at you."""
"Although the same bumper and announcement interrupted the show during every broadcast across Australia, it occurred in different parts of the programme depending on the area it was airing in, due to time differences: In the eastern states, the station simply started airing an episode of ""Cheers"" after a scheduled commercial break, but in other areas, the last part of the show broadcast was of Mulray giving a monologue about ""bosoms"" or the aforementioned clip of a child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum. The show was cancelled before it was scheduled to air in Perth, and thus its Nine Network affiliate showed a brief message mentioning that the special wouldn't be aired before beginning an episode of ""Cheers""."
"Despite Packer's objections to the series' content, it was popular among viewers. The special was recorded to a record studio audience. After the announcement, Nine reportedly received ""thousands"" of phone calls from viewers, with 65 percent of callers upset with the programme being pulled, in contrast to the 60 callers who called in during the show's broadcast, complaining about the show. Viewers were generally bewildered by the sudden interruption and the cut to ""Cheers"", not knowing about the show's cancellation until it was widely reported by the Australian media outlets the next day."
"The day after the special aired, a furious Packer showed up at Nine's headquarters and held meetings in which he loudly berated Nine's managers and censors, referring to the program as ""disgusting and offensive shit."" After these meetings, Mulray and many of the staff who were involved with the creation of the special were fired, with Mulray being banned for life from Channel Nine."
"On his radio show the next day, Mulray commented, ""I am the first man in Australian history to be pulled off by Kerry Packer."""
"Mulray returned to Nine to be a judge on the 2005 series ""StarStruck"" shortly after Packer's death on December 26 of that year."
"In 2008, a full copy of the show was located by Nine's head of factual television."
"It was aired in its entirety at 8:30 PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same time. Promoted as ""the show Kerry Packer didn't want you to see"", it featured commentary from Bert Newton; Packer had died in December 2005, and Mulray refused Nine's request to host the special."
"The special was interrupted by the Channel Nine bumper and ""technical difficulties"" announcement 36 minutes in, cutting to the ""Cheers"" opening credits before resuming to a monologue by Newton, and the latter part of the special that never aired. The re-airing was censored, with portions of Mulray's monologues (including jibes about ""fat kids"") being cut from the special as they were deemed to be ""no longer acceptable""."
= = = Sequence of tenses = = =
"Sequence of tenses (known in Latin as consecutio temporum, and also known as agreement of tenses, succession of tenses and tense harmony) is a set of grammatical rules of a particular language, governing the agreement between the tenses of verbs in related clauses or sentences."
"A typical context in which rules of sequence of tenses apply is that of indirect speech. If, at some past time, someone spoke a sentence in a particular tense (say the present tense), and that act of speaking is now being reported, the tense used in the clause that corresponds to the words spoken may or may not be the same as the tense that was used by the original speaker. In some languages the tense tends to be ""shifted back"", so that what was originally spoken in the present tense is reported using the past tense (since what was in the present at the time of the original sentence is in the past relative to the time of reporting). English is one of the languages in which this often occurs. For example, if someone said ""I need a drink"", this may be reported in the form ""She said she needed a drink"", with the tense of the verb ""need"" changed from present to past."
"The ""shifting back"" of tense as described in the previous paragraph may be called backshifting or an attracted sequence of tenses. In languages and contexts where such a shift does not occur, there may be said by contrast to be a natural sequence."
"In English, an ""attracted sequence"" of tenses (backshifting) is often used in indirect speech and similar contexts. The attracted sequence can be summarized as follows: If the main verb of a sentence is in the past tense, then other verbs must also express a past viewpoint, except when a general truth is being expressed."
"For example, if Batman spoke the following words:"
the speech act may be reported using the following words:
"with the present tense ""need"" replaced by the past tense ""needed"", since the main verb of saying (""said"") is in the past tense. Further examples can be found at ."
"In some cases, though, a ""natural sequence"" of tenses is more appropriate. Here the tense of a verb in a subordinate clause is not determined by the tense of the verb in the superordinate clause, but is determined simply according to the sense of the clause taken apart from the rest of the sentence. The rule for writers following the natural sequence of tenses can be expressed as follows: imagine yourself at the point in time denoted by the main verb, and use the tense for the subordinate verb that you would have used ""at that time"". Thus the tense used in the indirect speech remains the same as it was in the words as originally spoken. This is normal when the main verb is in the present or future tense (as opposed to past tense or conditional mood). For example:"
However it is also possible to use the natural sequence even if the main verb is past or conditional:
"This option is more likely to be used when the circumstance being expressed remains equally true now as it did when the speech act took place, and especially if the person reporting the words agrees that they are true or valid."
"Debate amongst grammarians over the appropriateness of the two types of sequence of tenses goes back as far as the 18th century. Use of the attracted sequence sometimes leads to additional problems when the grammatical construction of indirect speech includes an incorporated quotation – that is, when an attempt is made (though using indirect rather than direct speech) to report the words actually spoken. For example, if a minister spoke the words ""Such a policy is not without its drawbacks"", then a writer may attempt to report this as follows:"
"using quotation marks to denote that that portion of the sentence represents the minister's actual words. This, however, requires use of the natural sequence of tenses, which might not be felt appropriate in the given situation. There are various possible solutions to this problem:"
"Similar problems arise from the other changes that typically occur in indirect speech, such as changes of pronoun (depending on speaker), etc."
"For more details, see the article on indirect speech, and also the article on uses of English verb forms, particularly the sections on indirect speech and dependent clauses."
"Indirect speech in Russian and other Slavic languages generally uses the natural sequence of tenses (there is no backshifting). For examples, see ."
"In Latin, the sequence of tenses rule affects dependent verbs in the subjunctive mood, mainly in indirect questions, indirect commands, and purpose clauses. If the main verb is in one of the non-past tenses, the subordinate verb is usually in the present or perfect subjunctive (primary sequence); if the main verb is in one of the past tenses, the subordinate verb is usually in the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive (historic sequence). For example, when the subordinate verb refers to a time contemporaneous or later than the time of the main verb, the present or imperfect subjunctive is used:"
"When the subordinate verb refers to a time earlier than that of the main verb, the perfect or pluperfect subjunctive is used:"
"If the main verb is a historic present (i.e. a present tense with a past meaning), either primary or historic sequence may be used, or in a long sentence even a mixture of the two:"

= = = Assyrian nationalism = = =
"Assyrian nationalism or Assyrianism increased in popularity in the late 19th century in a climate of increasing ethnic and religious persecution of the Assyrians of what is today central Iraq, south-east Turkey and north-west Iran."
"Assyrian nationalism – the ideology of a united Assyrian people – is to a great degree based on a common and specific historic, ethnic, religious, linguistic, cultural and geographic background and heritage. It is espoused by almost all Mesopotamian East Aramaic-speaking Assyrians. They are exclusively Christians, with most Assyrians following the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Ancient Church of the East and Protestant groups like the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church, as well as those that are irreligious."
"They are the indigenous peoples of Mesopotamia, whose ancestors established the Assyrian Empire in what is modern day Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The empire lasted from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC until its collapse around 7th century AD. Assyrian nationalism is also common in the diaspora communities that left these areas for Armenia, Georgia, Russia, Lebanon, Jordan and Azerbaijan and migrant Assyrians from all these lands now residing in the European Union, United States, Canada and Australia."
"The United Nations Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) recognises the modern Assyrians as an indigenous people of south-east Turkey, north-east Syria and the fringes of north-west Iran, as does the Political Dictionary of the Modern Middle East."
"The ideology of Assyrian nationalism advocates Assyrian independence or autonomy within the regions they inhabit, and is based on the political and national unification of ethnic Assyrian followers of a number of Syriac Christian Churches (mainly those originating in, or based in and around northern Mesopotamia) with classical Syriac as its cultural language and Eastern Aramaic dialects as spoken tongues. Its main proponents in the late 19th century and early 20th century were Naum Faiq, Freydun Atturaya, Ashur Yousif, Malik Khoshaba and Farid Nazha."
"Within the Syriac Christian population in the near east as a whole, Assyrianism is confined specifically by certain geographic, ethnic, linguistic and confessional boundaries."
"Geographically and linguistically an Assyrianist position is held by those who speak Eastern Aramaic dialects who live or descend from those who once lived in the northern half of Iraq, the north-east of Syria, south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran."
"Theologically, the position is a little more complex."
"Followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church usually adhere to an Assyrianist position, although sometimes the term Chaldo-Assyrian is used to avoid theological conflict between Assyrian followers of the original Church of the East and those who broke away between the late 17th and early 19th centuries and entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, which named this new church the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830. Chaldean Catholics should not be confused with ancient Chaldeans, a long extinct people with whom they share no links."
"Eastern Aramaic-speaking populations who follow the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church and live or descend from those who lived in northern Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and the southern Caucasus tend to regard themselves as Assyrian, whereas formerly Western Aramaic-speaking and now almost exclusively Arabic-speaking Levantine members of these churches from the rest of Syria, Lebanon and south-central Turkey often espouse an Aramean, Phoenician (more common among Maronite Christians) or even Greek heritage (see Arameanism and Phoenicianism."
"This is in part due to the term ""Syriac"" being generally accepted by the majority of scholars to be a 9th-century BC derivation of ""Assyrian"" which for many centuries was used in specific and sole relation to the Assyrians and Assyria, and in part because the majority of the Christian population of these areas are not geographically from what was Assyria or Mesopotamia, and thus do not identify with an Assyrian heritage in the way that the ""pre-Arab"", ""pre-Islamic"" Mesopotamian Assyrians from Iraq, north-east Syria, south-east Turkey, Iran and the Caucasus naturally do."
"According to Raif Toma, Assyrianism goes beyond mere Syriac patriotism, and ultimately aims at the unification of all ""Mesopotamians"", properly qualifying as ""Pan-Mesopotamianism"". This variant of Assyrianism is independent of Christian, ethno-religious identity and qualifies as a purely ethnic nationalism, in that it identifies the Assyrian people as the heirs of the Assyrian Empire, and as the indigenous population of Mesopotamia, as opposed to Arabism, which is identified as a chronologically later, non-indigenous, and foreign intrusive element. This is expressed for example in the Assyrian calendar introduced in the 1950s, which has as its era 4750 BC; then thought to be the approximate date of construction of the first (pre-historical, pre-Semitic) temple to Ashur."
"Organisations advocating Assyrianism are the Assyrian Democratic Organisation, Assyrian National Congress, Assyrian Universal Alliance (since 1968) and Shuraya (since 1978). The Assyrian flag was designed by the Assyrian Universal Alliance in 1968."
"Mordechai Nisan, the Israeli Orientalist, also supports the view that Assyrians should be named specifically as such in an ethnic and national sense, are the descendants of their ancient namesakes, and denied self-expression for political, ethnic and religious reasons."
"Dr. Arian Ishaya, a historian and anthropologist of UCLA, states that the confusion of names applied to the Assyrians, and a denial of Assyrian identity and continuity, is on one hand borne out of 19th- and early 20th-century imperialism and condescension on the part of the west, rather than by historical fact, and on the other hand by long-held Islamic, Arab, Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian policies, whose purpose is to divide the Assyrian people along false lines and deny their singular identity, with the aim of preventing the Assyrians having any chance of unity, self-expression and potential statehood."
"Naum Elias Yaqub Palakh (better known as Naum Faiq), a 19th-century advocate of Assyrian nationalism from the Syriac Orthodox Church community in Diyarbakir, encouraged Assyrians to unite regardless of tribal and theological differences."
"Ashur Yousif, an Assyrian Protestant from the same region of south-eastern Turkey as Faiq, also espoused Assyrian unity during the early 20th century, stating that the Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic and Syriac Orthodox Assyrians were one people, divided purely upon religious lines."
Freydun Atturaya (Freydon Bet-Abram Atoraya) also advocated Assyrian unity and was a staunch supporter of Assyrian identity and nationalism and the formation of an ancestral Assyrian homeland in the wake of the Assyrian genocide.
"Farid Nazha, an influential Syrian-born Assyrian nationalist, was deeply critical of the leaders of the various churches adhered to by Assyrians, accusing the Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church of creating divisions among them, when their joint ethnic and national identity should be paramount."
"The ideology of Assyrian independence is a political movement that supports the re-creation of Assyria as a nation state corresponding to part of the original Assyrian homeland, in the Nineveh plains of northern Iraq. The issue of Assyrian independence has been brought up many times throughout the course of history from before World War I to the present-day Iraq War. The Assyrian-inhabited area of Iraq is located primarily but not exclusively in the Ninawa-Mosul region in northern Iraq where the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh was located. This area is known as the ""Assyrian Triangle."" Assyrians are generally found all over northern Iraq, including in and around the cities of Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, Dohuk, Amadia and Rawanduz, and there are a fair number of exclusively Assyrian towns, villages, hamlets and agricultural communities in the north, together with others that have significant Assyrian populations. Other communities exist over the borders in south-eastern Turkey (Mardin, Diyarbakir, Harran, Bohtan, Kültepe, Hakkari), north-eastern Syria (Al Hasakah, Qamlishi Khabur delta) region and north-western Iran (Urmia)."
"In post-Ba'thist Iraq, the Assyrian Democratic Movement (or ADM) was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while Assyrian members of the ADM also took a full and active part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future."
"The continuity of Assyrian identity is endorsed and well supported by many non-Assyrian modern Assyriologists, Iranologists, orientalists, linguists, geneticists and historians, while others see the connection between ancient Assyria and the modern Assyrians as more complex. There was Assyrian resistance to Persian rule in Achaemenid Assyria. H. W. F. Saggs in his ""The Might That Was Assyria"" clearly supports cultural and historical continuity, as do Richard Nelson Frye, Simo Parpola, Robert D. Biggs and Patricia Crone among others."
= = = Sylvioidea = = =
"Sylvioidea is a superfamily of passerine birds, one of at least three major clades within the Passerida along with the Muscicapoidea and Passeroidea. It contains about 1300 species including the Old World warblers, Old World babblers, swallows, larks and bulbuls. Members of the clade are found worldwide, but fewer species are present in the Americas."
"The superfamily Sylvioidea was first proposed in 1990 in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds based on DNA–DNA hybridization experiments. More recent studies based on comparison of DNA sequences have failed to support the inclusion of some families such as Certhiidae (treecreepers), Sittidae (nuthatches), Paridae (tits and chickadees) and Regulidae (goldcrests and kinglets) but instead support the addition of Alaudidae (larks)."
"Some of the families within the Sylvioidea have been greatly redefined. In particular, the Old World warbler family Sylviidae and Old World babbler family Timaliidae were used as wastebin taxa and included many species which have turned out not to be closely related. Several new families have been created and some species have been moved from one family to another."
"In the case of diving equipment, oxygen cleaning generally involves the stripping down of the equipment into individual components which are then thoroughly cleaned of hydrocarbon and other combustible contaminants using non-flammable, non-toxic cleaners. Once dry, the equipment is reasssembled under clean conditions. Lubricants are replaced by specifically oxygen- compatible substitutes during reassembly."
The standard and requirements for oxygen cleaning of diving apparatus varies depending on the application and applicable legislation and codes of practice.
"For scuba equipment, the industry standard is that breathing apparatus which will be exposed to concentrations in excess of 40% oxygen by volume should be oxygen cleaned before being put into such service. Surface supplied equipment may be subject to more stringent requirements, as the diver may not be able to remove the equipment in an accident. Oxygen cleaning may be required for concentrations as low as 23%"
"Cleaning agents used range from heavy-duty industrial solvents and detergents such as liquid freon, trichlorethylene and anhydrous trisodium phosphate, followed by rinsing in deionised water. These materials are now generally deprecated as being environmentally unsound and an unnecessary health hazard. Some strong all-purpose household detergents have been found to do the job adequately. They are diluted with water before use, and used hot for maximum efficacy. Ultrasonic agitation, shaking, pressure spraying and tumbling using glass or stainless steel beads or mild ceramic abrasives are effectively used to speed up the process where appropriate. Thorough rinsing and drying is necessary to ensure that the equipment is not contaminated by the cleaning agent. Rinsing should continue until the rinse water is clear and does not form a persistent foam when shaken. Drying using heated gas – usually hot air – is common and speeds up the process. Use of a low oxygen fraction drying gas can reduce flash-rusting of the interior of steel cylinders."
"After cleaning and drying, and before reassembly, the cleaned surfaces are inspected and where appropriate, tested for the presence of contaminants. Inspection under ultraviolet illumination can show the presence of fluorescent contaminants, but is not guaranteed to show all contaminants."
Design for oxygen service includes several aspects:
"As a general rule, oxygen compatibility is associated with a high ignition temperature, and a low rate of reaction once ignited."
"Organic materials generally have lower ignition temperatures than metals considered suitable for oxygen service. Therefore the use of organic materials in contact with oxygen should be avoided or minimised, particularly when the material is directly exposed to gas flow. When an organic material must be used for parts such as diaphragms, seals, packing or valve seats, the material with the highest ignition temperature for the required mechanical properties is usually chosen. Fluoroelastomers are preferred where large areas are in direct contact with oxygen flow. Other materials may be acceptable for static seals where the flow does not come into direct contact with the component."
"Only tested and certified oxygen compatible lubricants and sealants should be used, and in as small quantities as is reasonably practicable for effective function. Projection of excess sealant or contamination by lubricant into flow regions should be avoided."
"Commonly used engineering metals with a high resistance to ignition in oxygen include copper, copper alloys, and nickel-copper alloys, and these metals also do not normally propagate combustion, making them generally suitable for oxygen service. They are also available in free-cutting, castable or highly ductile alloys, and are reasonably strong, so are useful for a wide range of components for oxygen service."
"Aluminium alloys have a relatively low ignition temperature, and release a large amount of heat during combustion and are not considered suitable for oxygen service where they will be directly exposed to flow, but are acceptable for storage cylinders where the flow rate and temperatures are low."
"Hazards analyses are performed on materials, components, and systems; and failure analyses determine the cause of fires. Results are used in design and operation of safe oxygen systems."
= = = WSVE = = =
"WSVE was a radio station licensed in Jacksonville, Florida. WSVE was owned by Willis & Sons. WSVE last operated on 1280 kHz with 5,000 watts of power daytime & 133 watts nighttime."
"WIVY started broadcasting on 1050 kilohertz in August 1948. Its initial power was 1,000 watts, daytime only. It was affiliated with MacGregor, World & Hearst's INS. In 1971 it held a construction permit to move to 1280 kHz and in increase power from 1,000 watts daytime-only to 5,000 watts daytime-only. It also spawned WIVY-FM/102.9 in 1965. It changed callsigns to WEXI circa 1976."
"When WIVY changed calls to WEXI, WIVY-FM remained under its old callsign. WIVY/1280 aired a contemporary music format. It switched to all-news by 1978. WEXI became WXOZ circa 1985."
"Bishop Levi Willis, Sr.'s Willis & Sons, Inc. bought the station on July 14, 1986. It was by then WXOZ with a children's educational format. On March 14, 1987 it became WSVE."
"Stemming from a 1999 FCC investigation, Willis was fined over $84,000 in fines from the regulatory agency. Partially to satisfy this debt, Willis agreed to surrender the licenses of 4 stations: WSVE, WCRY, KVLA & KLRG. Of those 4 stations, KLRG is still on the air under different ownership."
= = = Mediated communication = = =
"Mediated communication or mediated interaction (less often, mediated discourse) refers to communication carried out by the use of information communication technology and can be contrasted to face-to-face communication. While nowadays the technology we use is often related to computers, giving rise to the popular term computer-mediated communication, mediated technology need not be computerized as writing a letter using a pen and a piece of paper is also using mediated communication. Thus, Davis defines mediated communication as the use of any technical medium for transmission across time and space."
"Historically, mediated communication was much rarer than the face-to-face method. Even though humans possessed the technology to communicate in space and time for millennia, the majority of the world's population lacked skills such as literacy to use them. This began to change in Europe with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy from the 15th century. Separately, the first print culture was Chinese in origin. Whatever the tradition, face-to-face interaction has begun to steadily lose ground to mediated communication."
"Compared to face-to-face communication, mediated communication engages fewer senses, transmits fewer symbolic cues (most mediated communication does not transmit facial expressions) and is seen as more private. Parties usually require some technical expertise to operate the mediating technologies. New computerized media, such as mobile telephones or instant messaging, allow mediated communication to transmit more oral and nonverbal symbols than the older generation of tools."
"The type of mediated technology used can also influence its meaning. This is most famously rendered in Marshall McLuhan's maxim ""the medium is the message""."
"Lundby (2009) distinguished between three forms of mediated communication: mediated interpersonal communication, interactive communication, and mass communication. Thompson (1995), however, treated mass communication not as a part of mediated communication, but on par with mediated and face-to-face communication, terming it ""mediated quasi-interaction""."
"There are only a few ways that mediated communication and face-to-face communication function similarly. One of them is that interpersonal coordination is present in both face-to-face and mediated communication. However, mediated communication has vast differences and limitations compared with face-to-face communication. Writing in communication media and speech in face-to-face communication are different in terms of their lexical density, range of grammatical structures, varied connectivity between sentences, syntax, permanence, etc. These differences in each type of communication can change the message. Texting and e-mail, for example, contain combined forms of writing and speech, which is evident by slang and shorthand. Verbal (or textual) cues are used instead of nonverbal ones to convey the same messages."
"Individuals send more information at a time through computer media than any other form of communication, including face-to-face communication. This increased rate of information transfer allows abusive forms of communication like cyberbullying and phishing to occur. The disassociation and disinhibition associated with mediated communication can cause people who are being deceived to have trouble interpreting the reactions of the deceiver since information sent through media instead of face-to-face can lose or have change the nonverbal cues within it, and, with that, signs of deception. The decreased availability of these nonverbal cues increases disassociation and anonymity. It is easier to trust someone else through mediated communication, but people with less trust can detect deception better online."
"Because of the limitations of mediated communication, Nardi and Whittaker (2002) note, ""Many theorists imply that face-to-face communication is the gold standard of communication."" Mediated communication has been, however, described as preferable in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue. For example, in maintaining long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after mediated communication tools of telephone, email and instant messaging."
"Individuals will use different types of media depending on their motivations, communication purpose, institutional factors, and situational factors. Also, people will be more inclined to use a particular medium of communication if others associated with them use that medium; this is called the network effect. Motivations for using certain media are divided into strong- and weak-tie communication. There are five communication purposes: coordination, knowledge-sharing, information gathering, relationship development, and conflict resolution. Institutional factors include the physical structure of work units, social structure, and incentives. Situational factors include task characteristics, message content, and urgency."
