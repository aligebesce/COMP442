"sober  he can do more than they do  I mean i that ain't the sort bloke you wanna lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them  well he gets on your nerves really  but at the end of the day I'll  you know, I'll put up with it."
"You can put up with that, good God!"
"Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but  and when he's like  Cor!"
And the other morning  disgrace!
"The funny thing is, like  there's a beer smell isn't there?"
Yeah.
"But he has got the sort of  acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath  just like you'd been on  spirits all night  or whatever, any sort of  you know, wine and  it's not a beer sort of smell."
"But I mean he's  I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!"
"I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?"
God he said!
Well I should think  that's   acidity in his stomach innit?
"Definitely  and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!"
"Oh it's not that, no it's not."
Where's he get the pain?
In his side.
In his side?
"I think he's rotting his liver, that's the feeling."
"Liver, yeah , exactly."
But you see he's that thick
.
"They ain't got  a mask or anything like Tutenkhamen has, have they?"
No  there was only one real mask.

Oh no!
"Nope, he don't know  erm  what he's saying is"
A lovely little man weren't he?
that blokes that's erm  dro been rigging it  who he does the things for.
Why?
"Well, because he said  for obvious reasons, he said er  I didn't want  my name and address  mentioned."

Now he's gonna wish we'd tell him  so he said erm
Well what has he done with it then?
"Oh it was genuinely gone  quite genuine, he said  you now, he had a , that we know about  but it had  genuine"
"Cor , it didn't do that!"
Well there are you  don't go near them.
Well we'll have to get our own then won't we?
So he said   choice  because it was his  property they contacted him  but he said what he's done is though right  there isn't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety
We're short on twenty two.
"We could  we can, ah no  no  in terms of money  he's talking about four or five thousand maximum."
Well
Where did you  get the twenty two from then?
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well Jimmy ought to tell her
"Well  you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim  so when  back, he's still gonna get the amount that he wants  so he said t to  Jim  something about, he isn't paying the insurance  I said you're joking!"
He said I've insured it he said but I ain't paying  as well he said!
"If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!"
So erm  they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
"Couldn't have been really much better really,"
Well
Yeah
"Well he was dashing out when I  when I called him  erm his wife answered the phone and she said  you just  him he's going out at the door  so he came rushing back and I said I wanted him to judge  champion of champions and  the  and I said there'll be two  and he said, hang on, and he's write it down said I'll just stick it all at one and see to it when I come back, oh I gotta go and he went."
Yeah.
And that was it.
Yeah yeah  yeah.
"Well he, he appreciated  at the previous table show on the sixth of October  and that was a case when it was always  you know, because Danny only told me on that night that he could come."
Yeah.
"So it was all a hotchpotch, it was all  and I had to do the  the best  I could for those who showed fish and that was the only way I could do it."

"But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er  you know,few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and  He's got too many"

Oh well that's good then.
we might even clear a little bit more than ten but
"Bit more than ten, yeah."
"I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything along and he's always  so"
"Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?"
Paul  spikes.
Excuse me!
You took them and I want the batteries for them.
Some people go round
You asked me for them.
in science books
Excuse me !
What does it say?
Fourteen and a half.
Were they marked?
No  look at this here.
Don't like the smell of your Narcissus.
Well go and  won't they.
Don't like the smell.
Somebody look!
Can you see it?
Let's go  .
Oh well neat!
"You know I can't see from that distance  I thought John had a snowman badge on today, when I got close it's an owl and it said I am the vet."
He enters into th the to the fray doesn't he with it er
No he's got a grey jumper with an owl  Beaky  on it  all over the front  and a mortar board on the owl.
Did they have to ask him to do that or did he just volunteer.
"Oh probably just did it  Do you know what Terry's   do you know what one of my children did today?do you know what  did  apart from the fact he spent all day crying  then he had to do the corrections, I said go back and do your corrections, said right  on your own  I wrote something that went no homework done, so he wrote no homework done,no homework done, no homework done !"
Oh no! er!
I can just scream !
Ah  spent all day weeping today  with one thing and another when he weeps
Why cos you keep telling him off?
he oh!
"They'd write a poem for her about my greatest fear, I said I remember last year there was a boy called Ali and he wrote a story about   a poem about this bird and cos he was really scared of that and so I said I don't suppose any of you will write about being scared of me  except perhaps Adine!"
Eh.
All Americans go Eh    Nine o'clock tomorrow I'm going over to  Kate  ten thirty that gives me a bit of lee-way  I've got a  at ten I thought it was ten thirty  I ought to get some money out really  You're not going into Woking tomorrow morning  are you doing your quiz?
"Do you want some help with it, not really."
"It's gotten on to her land  and off her land and into the ditch, which is  you know the N R A"
Where is that?
Er  Roydon some way?
You know where all those nurseries are?
And because the oil is coming  to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source.
"This is what she said and I, to me it doesn't sound right."
She said nobody'll  Nob they all say they haven't got the power to prosecute and I said well the N R A has.
They've got more clout than anybody else.
Mm.
More clout than the District Council.
And then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like.
"And I said I'm not talking about the council, I'm talking about the N R A!"
And now she wants me  to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who specialises in this sort of thing.
To take the District Council to court.
So that she's more expensive to them  than this other lot will be.
Apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution.
It's all this oil  from the boilers leaking on to her  into her soil and out into the ditch.
Well
Certainly is.
"But erm  in the back of my mind there comes  that she's saying to me  don't get involved, don't get involved."
"You know who owns all that land, it's the mafia."
And this could be why she's getting nowhere.
"You could give her er erm er wr , give her the address of Friends of the Earth, London."
Oh she's already .
That's how she got in contact with me!
You see they refer everybody on and then I
"Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor."
There must be green solicitors about.
I  have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her.
Because I don't know off hand.
"I've asked Jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a  solicitor if he knows anybody but I c , I can't  I haven't got the in information."
I don't
No.
As we was just coming home.
"She stood there  yabbing at the end of the counter, when are you coming out!"
He said oh for God's sake shut up Kim!
So she said er  shut up your fat    !
She didn't!
"He said I've told you before he said, if you ever say that again he said I was gonna knock your head off!"
And anyway I  walked past him and he went back and he was sh moaning at her  so erm  two of the old boys he'd been working with said whatever's all that about?
So there.
I said oh another one!
"I want well out of it, so course she come in  got changed, so he said to me I would like you tomorrow  to have a word with Robin  about stopping her coming down  to us he said because erm  it makes me feel very uncomfortable he said  and we had that hassle he said  it's a load of nonsense he said  I've forgotten"
Well I suppose it does make him feel uncomfortable.
"Yeah  he said I've forgotten about it  Blue's forgotten about it he said, but she won't let it rest he said  he said it's Well she's a child, she's only a child Geoff that's"
Yeah.
why.
Yeah he said I'm not having he says.
"She's like a spoilt child, she's gotta learn to"
"Yeah, he said"
from there soon.
"That's what he said, he said she can throw a tantrum he said and get everybody sort of feeling sorry for her he said, as and when she wants he said."
"Well I suppose it probably wasn't tha , a complete pack of lies Geoff."
"Yeah  so he said I I want ca , Robin to stop her coming down here he said."
So you've gotta be the one who tells him.
Yeah  so Ivan said
Well I think he's right.
"yeah, so Ivan said to me, he said er  he said well I do I suppose you have noticed he said but whenever she comes down here he said  the whole line stops  I said I quite agree  I said well let's be honest about it if he's knocking out the meat he , it's gotta stop  cos he  stops"
Jonathan !
"he stops talking to, stops to talk to her I said and obviously if the meat isn't coming out the box, the meat isn't coming out of the box!"
Well that's right.
Well that is right innit?
Yeah.
But she's like a child really  you gotta pity her really haven't you?
Can see me tonight can't you?
"Ah you are going to be so arsed, it's going to be so funny."
"I won't be that bad, I won't have any ci er  get one  gotta get some, have to  now cos we're not gonna have any."
I doubt if I'm gonna get  Phyllis is there.
Phyllis and Johnnie  .
"I call them  but it's not, it's ."
Oh I've got a sore knee ooh
It's no wonder!
"I've got fluid on it, it hurts."
Ooh
"Well you go to sleep bef when they've gone, when they go out"
"Yeah, have a bit of a kip for a bit can't I?"
I doubt if erm we'll be down here before she goes up to mine  I don't reckon.
When?
"Yeah she is, she's dropping in"
"for after, after mum and dad go  have the hand slapping and the  yeah they've gone!"
Anyway I wanna have a bit of a talk to her.
What about?
Well about all this business with Shrimpy.
"Yeah but you, you must admit Shrimpy's trying his damn hardest."
"I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for half the things she was talking about last night, I mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour trying to go to sleep"
"Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other, in the same room, just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other ."
Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just .
"We all know he still fancies her  he's just trying to, you know  keep it  he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to be back to  what, what they were."
"But flipping Scott, mister interferior"
Interferior ?
Yeah interferer.
"Flipping  no, it really annoys me that does."
They're always going on about how much Shrimpy  gets other people involved and  can't  stick up for himself aren't they?
And bloody  Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man.
What sort of things are you gonna say anyway?
"Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy  which is true"
"You know, he'll come running  glasses."
Yeah.
I can't do it.
"And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there."
"I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there."
"I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other."
"When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double."
"I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like  pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean,he did it to me when  did it to Johnny."
He probably thought  like.
"He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him."
"Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways."
I haven't got a lot of patience.
"But where  where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered"
Yeah.
"Where, when I start, Albert's"
"He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder and madder, and me dad used to love it."
"But looking back, you know, and now, that's what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up,but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I should just, I should, I mean, how can you change his temperament."
"I mean, I should just turn round and tell him where to go, but."
I think Colin winds you up summat chronic
I know.
And instead of just
Ignoring him.
Ignoring him.
"You don't, he  and he  going through bloody"
"Yeah, I know."
What
A  where
No.
Bird pooh on window.
"But,I mean, er,"
Where the birds have poohed on me window flying past.
Oh God.
"you can't tell him nothing  he would say  oh no no no, beer's no problem, beer's no problem no  it's not that experience, not that experience, I said well you wanna smell yourself Cliff!"
Cor God!
Well I still   alcohol.

Yeah alcohol
And your guess is that  he said er  bought something
Guinness is a heavy drink!
Yeah he's
That's surprising he don't have such a bad head!
No he said er
Ah  Cor!
Well fancy being a like that all that time  it's bad enough when you've been out on a binge and you get that headache then.
"Chris  Ivan said to me, he said  Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday  he said last night, I tell you, I said   I said no, no I didn't!"
Well how are you all gonna get home?
"Oh yeah he don't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home."
I said well I hope you enjoy .
"Well it isn't worth it, you can't afford to drink and drive can you?"
I know.
"Mel's got her lights up, did you see them?"
Yeah well   yeah.
"Mm  yeah talking about that now he's out the way  basically what he was gonna say was, as simple as this"
.
well it don't matter does it?
Oh alright then.
Yeah  no he was just saying that head office  they'll dictate to them like anybody else  so he said  I've got to have  erm  the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
"I thought you'd done that, you was gonna do that?"
"Yeah but I haven't  that's what he saying, but he said what I wouldn't do is ju , don't just say right phrum  there's"
What do you mean?
"there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right  sort of over the next month  but he said basically I cannot do anything until  erm  the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I can't do anything for you until then."
Did you tell him that?
Who?
Malcolm.
Because there's so many.
"She keeps on about all the time, every time I'm there."
Where you going now.
Whose house are you going to.
"It's almost like I'm a refugee  I felt right  I'm like, you know,"
"When you go home now, to which house?"
Where are you going.
"We were walk walking to erm the, down the high street and a plane went over, and erm, I think mum must have been saying to her about Aunty Jill being on holiday, and she went, ah, there's Aunty Jill in the plane going to the city."
It was really funny.
"I said, where did she get that from, my mum went oh I don't know."
"She went, yeah, my Aunty Jill's gone to the city, she's gone to a city."
"And then she said to me, and then, when I was going, she went to me, would you like to come on holiday, I went, then she went, because of me and mum and dad, we went another day to holiday, we went to beach, and er, mum said, that, yeah, mum said that she was saying, erm, to her, why, why is it not, what was it she said, about the weather, mum was moaning saying it was cold, and she went why, why aren't we go on holiday, mum, and mum said we can't, we can't afford to go on holiday, and she ah, why don't we go to seaside when it's cold."
"Mum says cos it costs lots of pennies, she went ah, another day, we'll go another day."
It's really funny.
She's got no concept of time.
"No, she hasn't  age, because she thinks she's  she's been a big girl, and she's now a little girl."
"That's right, yeah."
"She thinks she's  er, when I was like you, when I was a big girl,"
Yeah.
I did things like that.
Yeah.
Whereas not I will do things like that when I get older.
"Yeah, she thinks that she's been big already"
"Yeah, when I was, er she says when I was as big as Rebecca or when I was a big Joanna, it's always the name."
What did she say she did
"Just like,"
"got something on, or you got something."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had one of them
Yeah.
when I was a big girl.
"your letters look nice and neat, mine are always scraggy, I can never understand them."
"Dear Helena, I don't really  rea really know how to put this but I've had  I'll have a go."
I'm sorry about being in a mood on Saturday but I wasn't really in a mood with you.
I'll now tol t no  I know I told you that I was  that I was feeling
"That, that's"
sorry for someone not Emma or
he's done a sentence wrong there.
one like that .
Yeah.
I care for Emma more than I can say but I also care for you and I'm really sorry if you were hurt.
At the moment everyone has been talking about other people behind people's backs.
I didn't tell you what Emma thought because I  don't   is that a blank page?
Yeah.
I don't think a person told  I don't think a person told to  apologize isn't rea really an apology so I think there must be a reason why you didn't and so told me on Sunday why you didn't .
What a load of waffle.
"Oh I know, he just waffles."
I was going to apologize for being  stupid on Sunday when you both disappeared.
"Me and Andy looked all over, looked for both of you."
Last night I had a few things on my mind to be able to  apologize.
I'm sorry and hope we can still be friends .
I read it and I just went  what! for a start and then
"I went, and then I went  well he can't have looked around for us too well because we were walking by the side of the road."
But  yeah he probably come past  no he probably went up there as we come down that corner  by erm Ipsleigh and when they come back we'd probably gotten here by then.
"But we, I mean we were walking by the side of the road all the way up Greenlands Drive."
"What did I say, Scott then had the cheek to something me?"
"Wish me, that was it wasn't it?"
Scott's not your best friend at the moment then?
"Oh you may not have, you may have gathered that like anyway."
Erm enough  enough  of slagging   slagging  the little shit I think
The little shit .
shit stirrer.
"No, yes, shit ?"
Er   ha !
Wimborne market every Tuesday  and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.
"Used to have  horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday."
Ha!
You wouldn't think that there was a  enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?
But  mm.
"Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars."
I can remember  first motorcar that we drove in   old Charlie  's.
"Old Charlie's  car  wooden spokes, wooden wheels  solid tyres  and he used to sit up right in there  same as I am now, like in a box  and the old chauffeur   was the chauffeur driving along."
And I suppose they go along about  I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.
"Just, chug, chug, chug, chug."
At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
Oh yes!
Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
Mm.
Er er er  er er er
"I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?"
Yeah.
Mm.
And when you see them racing on the television!
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Ah!
But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.
Now you see  in my days on the railway  sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di it didn't reckon to  do much more than that see.
"I know  er, down at Corfe Junction or a  one road across or one another across or  there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road."
"And of course, they had these signs up  about la up close to a signal  er  twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that."
"And er  I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and  he er  he said to the inspector, oh he says er  I've been through Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!"
What!
"Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!"
"But he said, I have done."
"And er  course, that where the restrictions was on see  at the  and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now."
"It's a way of life, they've lived together that long, like, they don't want to"
"If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she would have left Pete."
I know.
"But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with, was why should I, why should I leave me home and sell up, she said, when all my life, he's had money from the house."
"He'll have the money from the house, plus a wage every week."
"She said, and what will I have, she said, just the money from the house."
"She said, and where do I live."
"You know, he can move back home with his mum, she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum, well then I've got to look for a job, you know."
Mm.
And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete.
Yes.
"Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a wage every week."
Yeah.
"You know, and she worked all them years, and then when she weren't working, she have no money coming in every week."
"Yeah, but she's got all the shares."
"She hasn't, she got rid of them all."
"Aye, not with Bl not with"
"Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that, I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week."
Yeah.
"We'll he had his money he won't have to touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week."
"Oh, aye,"
And he could start again.
Find another woman and buy another house and start again.
Mm.
"I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're not happy."
"They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's he's"
"They've got to do, aren't they, I mean, after all bloody  harm they caused."
"Yeah, you know, you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is."
Yeah.
He's another one.
"But you see when he living with Ange, maybe he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were living with Ange, he had all the women as you know, plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had everything, there was Kay,as well, weren't he, now he can't."
No.
Well Dave'll be down there today.
"Well not you can't pay on the night, can you?"
Well I suppose   I'm sure Adrian won't mind if I paid him  the day after or a week after or something.
"You're unemployed I wouldn't have thought you could've stood a hundred and fifty, two hundred pounds withdrawal."
No I don't mind  saying it I I'm not gonna ask any more.
What?
Well so that yo about Adrian  after a few weeks it's  you know
Remind me to wash in these cupboards before Sunday.
Yeah.
"Have you seen Jan and Joan dress up to their their Victorian day  Jan came like a an upright stripped  erm working, not working class a sort of governess right she had"
Yeah.
frumpy shoes and a .
Where'd she get the clothes from?
"Oh she borrowed it, and a bonnet and a  white flowers an all and Joan turned up like a  a twenty five year old Victorian fashion model  you should have seen her!"
Black silk skirt  maroon  blouse  her hair done up in a bun  draped with gold jewellery oh  talk about looking the part!
What's wrong with that?
And John hired this thing like a cape
Who's idea  is it?
Was it?
"Oh it's it's quite common, everybody does it if you have a vic if you study Victorians anyone who a Victorian   and they all they did all done out, chairs er table space at the front, they did drill in the playground  they played with tops and hoops in the playground, all the children  the m parents hired costumes from Fairy Godmothers  Fairy Godmother's done a roaring trade especially"
"Ah I should think Fairy Godmothers put the ideas into somebody's head, I would have thought."
That's not
We might
It's just a very good way of er teaching chi I mean children will I mean that's the kind of experience
Yeah.
"you never forget, do you?"
Some of  but you can't do it for something like a Medieval's day or Roman
No.
"day it'd be grim, but Victorian"
Victorian
"people have got a, yeah"
just close enough to sti still remember a lot of the cloths and stuff.
"Oh right, right, just so it's just mum and dad we're ."
Oh I need some money.
I want to believe it.
Now one of these in the morning and one at tea time.
"Twice a day, for the next week."
"One, two, three, four."
"Tell your mum she could be kinder to you, she's got to  for"
even though she's  already.
"Right oh, okay, bye Mrs ,"
Right
cheerio now.
up and call me now  A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse.
Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs.
Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it?
Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O  never mind you know the number.
Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals.
More specifically why we're so cruel to them.
Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics.
Why do we hate animals so much?
If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call  now  sorry.
"Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on?"
She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning.
What are you on?
I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are.
Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel.
But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed.
Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas.
The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan.
"Is this Alan Oritt, Alan?"
Correct yeah.
OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too.
it's too much isn't it?
"But like erm  my mum was saying, you know  she's like  she's  got a, definitely got a good job and like, the kids really sort of"
"You get, are you alright?"
Comfortable?
Yeah.
"sh , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and  goes to school and whatever!"
"But like erm  she said like, he's a really good kid."
Well
Mm.
"I mean  well I thought to myself, God what a life!"
"I mean, I know it's not her fault  but like, every Wednesday she has  all the people from the college bridge  go to her house to play bridge."
I mean the kid's
Poor kid!
just sat there on the sofa!
"I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever?"
"But like, I mean  God, do you know I'd really hate that!"
"I mean, I used to hate it with like  having  flipping  anyone come up to our house when I was little!"
Yeah.
"I remember, I remember once"
Apparently his mum's hardly there!
"Because  the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right  she said she doesn't mind doing  Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays  as well as the weekends  but she doesn't wanna do every day  each week."
"Ma , how much does she go out?"
"I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him!"
Yeah!
I mean  ooh!
"That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum  you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like  they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights  and she said, like  unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go  which is the reason I'm doing it."
So like
Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
"Yeah  say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know  it's too bad sort of thing!"
"So I think I'm gonna change my nights  this, of staying in  to either Mo , Monday and Wednesday or  Tuesday and Wednesday  something like that."
I don't know really!
"But like, like erm  that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to  mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?"
Let's hope he gets off the floor.
"walking across roads a risk, ain't it."
Yeah.
It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it.
"It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power."
I got
"I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all."
"I can tell you that, now."
Oohh.
What?
Oohh.
"You feel like  er, that's whose, like ex soldiers  throughout the company, and he said to Colin er, he said, how many people are you thinking about employ , our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he says, he says, well how many people are you thinking about employing, he says, only only me and me  like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work to keep two of going, he said, I thought you employed about six."
"So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em."
"Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker"
"Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya."
Yeah.
That's it.
"He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but  the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose."
"Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it."
"There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford,"
Yeah.
round about here.
"Mind Lee's a, Lee's a good worker, he says that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can"
"Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm."
Yeah.
"You know, I mean"
"Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working with him when he were at er  over in Brad oh, here's Richard now."
"Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him,"
"Oh dear, no but he is, Richard is the one with the  comical magazine,laughing bursts two incomes."
I think that's part of
Yes.
"Look, slow down, or you're driving me mad."
"Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it."
Mm.
"So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they?"
Mm.
Did this one?
No!
The loop's attached to the end of the strap!
"It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn!"
"So that meant I had to get  the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!"
"So like, you can imagine  I had to have all the strap completely undone  so like  the, the buckle was like down here!"
And above the knot!
Comfortable then?
"Well  it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like  it was really weird because like  you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you  and then like  not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think  why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump  on half the top of her boob, you know !"
It's like a lump there!
"They're thinking, mm, a shame !"
"But like, it was alright then because like  means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time  and so  I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on  like  for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic  love bite around my neck !"
But like er
But I mean
So that was alright really.
"But, I couldn't believe it cos I  he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?"
"And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't"
Yeah.
like them!
Same as me!
"I goes to Scott, I really really  hate love bites   and er  and he goes, yeah and me."
"The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party  Fran , Franny someone, he's  actually a bloke !"
Ooh that's
"I said that's   he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk  and he gave  Scott, Noel and Ian  a love bite  like  for a joke !"
He just decided to do  just for a laugh!
"Oh, how sick!"
Ah what a gay !
"I know like, anyway  but like, Scott had gone home  said to his mum  like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck?"
But I oh I used to go to the country dancing.
So was there a drama club going in  when you came here?
No.
That would be finished up?
"That was finished up, mhm."
"What about the  one, was it still going?"
When you came here?
"I don't think so, I can't remember  eh it going then."
Because I think it was Tommy that said it was really after the  one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here.
"Yes, but er it was actually Mike  that got it back up here,Mike  and Grace , John  's first wife that started it up."
"I can remember Leslie coming home, I think I must have been expecting Doreen at the time, that was in, that was early early on, nineteen, well that was nineteen sixty three, and he was, he had heard that had I had been in the Gatehouse Drama Club, and er he said, Would I be interested in com in coming to the Drama in  if they started?"
Leslie said he would need a special part for me then.
But that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up.
They were very good for it's first
Oh the first concert oh yes
those kind of people.
The f I often find that really the first year it was more fun  and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and
A bit more like hard work really?
"It was really, there wasn't so much fun in it, it was all more serious."
And when Bobby  was there it really was
I remember
Oh yes.
He and Andy  together were very good .
"Mhm, yes, oh they were, aha."
"Bobby was really, he just kept it going really."
Sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people ?
"It , it just needs a character really, just to keep it going."
And he really was a character.
"somehow in the drama, even though it's so long since he passed away ."
There's nobody can replace individual people .
"There no, no, nobody at all."
And do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe a bit more of a strain you know the competitions and
"I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute."
"So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than   thereabouts and er that was it."
"But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the   ."
"Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did."
"He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then  he says he didn't carry on, like."
He hadn't been doing  and er  reckon he  and er  think I'm  and that was it  so  right    Been driving since he was  nineteen
"two or three months ago, I think it was."
"I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what  and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since  you know ."
"You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own  fine ."
"So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine?"
He says I am gonna cop it off me mother  cop it of his mother.
You're always going too fast!
I told you before!
"He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad!"
Mm.
slow down.
"Yeah  obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard."
"He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people?"
"Mm, yeah."
Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front.
Mm saw him coming  have to get it  cos Neil's mum was cross about it.
Oh well  he was only just finding out what the rules were.
There was a gang of us chatting with him.
I come up with six points.
That made his day.
He says have I got a fixed penalty?
I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty.
"Know somebody who got one, like."
"No, only a bloke  I've never seen one  had one."
"Yeah, that'd be Richard."
Mm only he's got to  take his licence and insurance in.
As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court  so  it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious.
Yeah.
And also for doing the programme.
Yeah?
"And you want a task schedule for organizing  this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Erm  how is that then?
Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute?
Carry on on that basis?
"Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps  that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale."
Well obviously we've got to progress into that.
We need to prepare some  zone plans and gazetteers maybe.
Yeah.
"Erm  oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er  we could be looking er  towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that."
"There's no real reason why  you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that."
Yeah.
"Erm  y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work."
Okay.
"Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it."
Erm  so you need to build up a picture of what you've got  erm  but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me.
Er in principle.
"Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network  erm  Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run  things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting."
So there'll be two sides of it c er
"Well there, there won't be any  will there?"
Erm
Mm.
But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture.
"What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips."
Which is what happened on Ormskirk.
Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme.
"But there's no reason, and on  as well."
Alright?
Yeah well that don't help with getting your money though does it?
"No  and what's happened is, he's been up the bank  and er  the thing has"
Saved his money.
"and the thingo's gobbled up his card  as he said, well if it hasn't  gobbled your card  then  no problem."
If it has
There's a problem.
"we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week  so  he said well it definitely has."
"Did he say, I'm desperate for my money!"
Yeah  so he said well  what do erm    and he said the woman up there didn't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Why did it gobble his card up then?
Well because A T S  had gone  straight to the bailiff  and the courts  to freeze his account.
Ooh my God!
Mm  because his account was frozen  as soon as he put his card in  it took it in!
Oh!
"So he said, can I get a new card?"
Could you have that done to you then?
No.
You couldn't have that done to you?
"Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done."
Well no cos I ain't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card  but bank said he put the cheque card in  and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he
Alright.
could draw it up to a  a thousand pounds  on that card  I mean
"And you said he's only just paid it, well"
"That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I wouldn't of paid it!"
He says I'd better go and check the money  so he said erm  but what he couldn't understand was  they wrote to him and said that  they haven't paid the cheques  but they didn't say anything about freezing his account!
"Well they should by law, surely!"
Well  dunno.
So he said erm  I said to the woman  I went to the court this morning  so he said   when you explain to me  he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad  tha he said I owed sixty two pound  so he said I said to the woman   in the  court  how can I pay this  the sixty two pounds  when you've frozen my account?
"She said, that's your problem!"
"That is  their own fault  because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying  they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it"
Mm.
they must be selling it
Well they will do.
"them very cheap  because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling"
No thanks.
and it said  about tin cans and aluminium and that  and it was costing them less  excuse me  to use recycled  you know er  used aluminium
Mm.
and used steel cans and that  it was costing them  less to use that  than it was to use
Brand new stuff.
yeah.
Yeah.
"So, I mean  to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but  that my first thought is that they must be buying it very"
It's gotta be profitable
they must be buying it very cheap then?
Mm.
Mm.
"So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it  are selling it to them very cheap  so it is their own fault!"
I think initially er
It's only it's been cheaper to
now has got a cost more  in the initial
Well it does
"stages  until it's sort of, set up, until  everyone is sort of you know  geared into doing this  kind of  you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the  goes there"
"Well yes, because they're not"
"and all the companies that are responsible for  for re-using it  and all the  distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there  you know, once that network is going then surely"
Oh yes!
it's gotta be  useful because  instead of going  you know  from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being  ever seen again  it's going
That's right!
"in a circle and, and  surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up?"
"And it's a, it's an ongoing thing"
Yeah!
"You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean  it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have  three bins."
Pine pastures green to the tops of Ben Dorain and and up Black Mount where the Craig estate took it was it was in their estate.
So therefore my father was very keen to go too.
Mm.
And that's how we decided to go.
So Dalmally I should safely say was my first schooling.
Even though I was about eight and a half.
Mm.
Now your father was the the stocker at Tormore is that right ?
Yes he was the stocker at Tormore.
Who was he employed with then?
Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in Canada on the C P R.
Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in  out to Canada.
Mm.
What d'ya recall of your early days with your father at Tormore?
Pardon?
What d'ya recall of your early days at Tormore with your father?
Well  he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of  as you would say because we had sheep then.
And if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down.
Mm.
Without a collie dog.
And well I remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as I grew up myself.
So he was  and it had it's Tormore House was really a lovely place.
Did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate?
Yes.
Oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to Inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then.
But they were good metal roads that took all the traffic.
Well I remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside Tormore House and many's the day I was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead.
A Hugh .
No  relation but a great friend of ours.
He was a steam roller driver.
Mm.
And were the gentry in er Lochassynt Lodge or was it Tormore?
", in olden days, before they built the er bridge."
When the all the traffic came across the level crossing there.
There's still a signal box there.
erm that's now a private house isn't it?
"Yeah, it's a listed building."
But er rather nice.
"And a barrow, a very common sight, and this this type of er of awning, erm very very common, er the barge-boarding er and the er and and the again the roof and the er chimneys and very interesting sort of a  In the garden erm of the sort of station master's house, is that."
Very much like er the style used er in coal offices and erm weigh weighbridge at .
That's still there.
"Erm where there's a caravan office, or caravan sales place just by the station, at , sorry at er ."
"Erm I remember er thinking one day, erm I must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar, I'll go back at the weekend and get that."
I went back at the weekend and it was a pile of rubble.
"And that is the danger if you don't do things at the sec at the time, because er things do get er knocked down."
"Nice little building, little Wendy House there."
.another picture of it.
just playing .
But er nice little summer house there.
now.
And let's just w just take one or two other pictures just for interest.
Just to show you a bit further on.
That's what Nottingham Station i used to look like from London Road Bridge.
Isn't that beautiful.
". Absolute er Changed a bit hasn't it since er Well the lines have gone, the signal box and er and so on."
The old  's premises at the back.
"And the bridges, erm lovely  O six O, and er erm four wheeled guard's, guard's van with a veranda at this end."
Erm these er this is a one a of three or four photographs erm from the  Society collection.
We've got erm tens of thousands of photographs.
Quite a number are erm there's quite a few taken in the Nottingham area in .
"Erm and this is one in  Station, one of the  spinners."
Beautiful design locos.
These erm finished there days really on easy graded routes such as the Nottingham Lincoln line.
And er that's waiting to take a train out to Lincoln.
Did he come with the start of the scheme then really?
"No well it wasn't the scheme he worked on, he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that, maintenance, the maintenance side."
"Er other thing, and they lived down there opposite the garage, that was the electricity board house then."
So would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself?
I ca I came here in nineteen sixty one.
Sixty one.
Mhm.
"That's when I got married, nineteen sixty one, I came up."
What did you think of  when you came ?
"Well it was just a quiet wee village just  I had come, wasn't much different it was quiet as well."
Mhm.
And er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really.
"Everybody was very friendly, it didn't matter whether you were an incomer or not, they always spoke."
Mhm.
You got to know people  very quick  in .
"That was one thing about the village, and your your neighbour would where Jane is the now, I don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in Dumfries, but here they were always you know"
You couldn't get away from them.
Oh they were in or out.
So did you do any singing when you came here first?
What was the first kind of thing you got involved in ?
"Oh the rural choir, I forgot about that, yes, I joined the rural choir and ."
"And er I couldn't sight read or anything like, I can't sight read."
"But I can remember once when I was at the school Mrs  was our music teacher and we were to go from doh to far, you know doh to far, and they used to s , she used to say listen to Mabel, Mabel's the only one one of you that can go from doh to far."
But er  so when we came Mrs  the sight reading of course I was lost because she used to
Is that Mrs John ?
No Mrs Billy.
Billy.
She used to take the rural choir.
How long had it been going then when you came?
"Oh it had been going for quite some time, I don't know really when they would start."
Was it all ladies ?
"Mhm, yes, oh aye, all ladies."
Erm then.
"And er so I mean it's you know, I am a politician I mean you know, it's in the blood I've b been in the in the House of Commons now for about a quarter of a century."
"Over a quarter of a century, most of it on the front bench."
And erm I like it.
"But the fact is I mean I you know, you do ask these questions, your family make you ask these questions quite understandably."
I there are other things I could do.
I'm a manic gardener and I that's what I've been doing.
"Erm I could go back to commerce, although er that side of my life is some way behind and it it's always been very successfully done by er my colleagues in the company that I started."
"So er you know I I've I've never had a sort of er a one way track about politics, although I adore it and I've er I've enjoyed it hugely Am enjoying it and I"
"Ah I was going to pick  you said, I have enjoyed it hu I was about to leap in and say, Ah that means ."
Yes ye no no no no no no.
How kind.
"Well that's the value of a programme like this, you can correct."
Otherwise that'd be over the headlines.
"Heseltine says, Future"
Quite.
is in the past.
You know
Which is not exactly what I am saying.
Erm no the fact is that er I I love politics.
It's er and and I have always wanted to be president of the board of trade.
"But what about more ambition, further ambition now?"
Well that's a sort of wary question but all politicians
But you'd expect me to ask it.
I know you're bound to ask it.
And you I'm not going to give any different answer I've ever given.
I my belief is that John Major will win the next election.
"I helped to win the last one, I shall help to win the next one."
"And er er I I think that er all this sort of chat about leadership challenges and all that, I think that's for the birds."
I don't think we shall see it.
I especially I don't think so after after the very er impressive speech he made on Friday.
But there is We can come to that in a moment if we may.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there."
"And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the"
"or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty"
Yes.
there's very limited facilities for children to play.
So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh .
"Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things."
So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea.
Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital.
"I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry."
It's gonna be a week  .
So she wanted to know what date it is.
"So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details."
"And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all."
"And that she was going on Wednesday, I think."
Up she went  you know
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which
It's
one?
Mrs  was going to see Miss
Was going to see Miss
.
Oh.
I see.
I didn't know which one.
But I give them a  so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday    when I was at Ashington.
And she came up with all sorts of things that  she would like for the  the new Wandsbergh development.
"But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so th there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time."
"So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth."
Oh aye
eighty five points.
"We've done er eighty, eighty something points I think, we've done the fucking"
"I know but er that's what I mean, we get all the, a lot of them, about four of them topics worth, we're being given the equivalent of one of the topics you may be do next year you know."
"You know you can get  and circular motion   and stuff all  and AC, you know, it's that big."
"Next year, year's topic will be nuclear, nuclear physics, it's fucking massive,it's about a hundred topics"
"Seriously next year boy you're gonna get one major  awakening, you think this year's bad for physics, wait to you start next year."
"I, I, I understand all the work like and I'm sitting in class and I'm doing fine  fuck all and then I come in and get a test like and he cracks up"
Fucking
Who is?
Me.
"He come in laughing one day, look at this Paul, look at this and he shows me this big long letter that this teacher had wrote on."
"Erm you see we were given this test, right, it was on    gravity or something"
Hiya
Hello
"and  freaked out, right, er we did the test on Friday, right and he wasn't in on the Monday"
Yeah yeah.
"we were going  yo he's not in , came in the Tuesday  the reason I was off yesterday was cos I was so fucked off  with your test , but he didn't say fucked off"
Yeah.
"Erm  erm and then he was going spare and he says these are the worst I've ever received in all the years I've been teaching, right?"
"And he went the next ones had better be better, right,the next ones were worse"
totally disastrous.
"Well I'm, aye he just hit the roof, I got fucking twenty five or something."
"All of my test marks like Paul  eighty, seventy two er fifty six, forty three  thirty three, thirty three, twenty five"
as well eh?
No chance.
"I would rather  even kill myself, and I do mean kill myself than do"
You're wearing your T-shirt?
No I haven't seen this for a while yet
had this one on for a few days.
Yeah we were out last night.
Yeah.
Norma.
"Pack  one, her."
"I know, I call that, but I mean, I don't  down the town,but her."
"But I, I didn't think I like that."
"Mum, mum watch this, are you watching."
You have to lose a race now and again.
"Yeah, but she ain't even,"
"Are you watching,"
"er, what was was I saying, the  I don't know what George has  all the customers, I mean, she's isn't even particularly"
"isn't she, she's not what you call really bonny, she ain't got a right bonny face."
I know she's got a nice figure.
"She's as thick as two short planks, she's got a dirty mouth."
"I mean, I, you know, maybe"
I can't understand  your cross.
I know.
Cannot understand  or something.
Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese.
"Plenty of different people  cheap, er,the other people who have different likes to you, but what, what you might think's attrac attractive, somebody else'll"
Yeah.
"won't be, you know."
"To be quite honest, without talking like a school  on a fence."
"They're not very happy, they ain't been happy for a while, but it's getting worse,wh is, what is them now is, you know I say things to Colin, and Co I mean, Colin'll tell me like, you know, you know,over there, and er, he's latest thing is, they built this little office."
"You know when you go into  on the right, er a coal-house and a wash- house ain't there."
Yeah.
"The coal-house part it's is quite wide now we've done it, big coal-house, but altered"
"And then it twists, and like a small office, and when when I were there, after Michael had shown it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in here to get get out of way, and you know, he was like telling me, I thought I don't want to be a fiddle, because it's alright telling Colin, the boys"
"telling yeah,"
Yeah.
"ain't it, yeah, it's not like a woman telling you problems."
Don't knock my dusters off.
"Anyway, I just said, well, summat about  about what I said, I says, yeah,nice to get away from it all, ain't it, to be by yourself, and that's all I said, and I think he knew that I I didn't want to"
"but, and he said to Colin"
and they had to they had to sit in rows and they had to do as they were told and they weren't allowed
Ha!
to speak.
Yes.
Apparently some of the children got quite scared of Jan cos Jan played the part so well  ah Joan  for life.
Frightened the life out of them.
Yeah.
Ah back ah back ah back and bill .
So what did John look like perhaps like a little Billy Bunter didn't he?
"Ah no he looked very good he had a gown and a mortar board and cane  and bow tie  and pin striped socks, quite good, yep."
And they wore that all day all of them all day?
"All day and then he got  all to do   at lunch time  yeah they kept it up all the day, they had separate play time, they had had to eat their lunch in the class room  all they were allowed was a piece of fruit, a bread and water  and they all had to have, you know, they had a bread roll  supplied by the school  an a an apple I think    And Jan made them write out their names and some of them couldn't write their name!"
Boy called Daniel couldn't write Daniel cos all last year he'd been allowed to put Danny  an he'd forgotten how to write Daniel!
Search me!
How old's that child?
Ten  and John
And he can't
"that's what's so dreadful, Joe was language coordinator and they came from her!"
Can't write names.
And another boys name was Thomas   and he couldn't write that cos all last year he'd been Tom  an he'd forgotten how to write his surname  they're not dim children  both of them
Frightening isn't it?
family  she says  quite an eye opener  an they had write lines if they did anything wrong  one boy just   I reckon she could carried him but
No.
You can't be  three times    Where's tonight gone?
All this stuff in out here shall I?
"You think you're exhausted after a days work imagine if you've been doing that all day long, shouting"
Look!
"and shrieking, no I mean that"
I shout and shriek all day long!
Ooh I'll lose my voice up there today  we've done some really good things though  try and do see more my hall is very full  if he bothered to come to school he'd have seen them!
Still  find those  what's this that's broken from?
But Mummy you could
You'll be knackered.
I know.
Er yeah so we'll have this thing at Arrow Park to do.
He's hoping to do that.
"We'll looking into doing  we need to know how many cars gone in, how many cars go out"
Into the ?
of the hospital grounds.
But there's residential sections as well.
And then see how long each vehicle stayed there.
There's two entra entrances
You'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car!
That's what we are doing.
Jesus god!
It's probably because they're taking over the er  accident and emergency department from Clatterbrick it's shutting down and it's all going to Arrow Park.
Well that's not why we're doing it.
Well it is.
"That's what's happening, it was on the radio the other day."
This is just  well I mean it maybe connected with that but we're doing it because they want to increase the car parks .
So we're looking to do it with tape recorders  on the busiest entrance  and you know and just say car D five one four R G M  blah blah blah.
Get them all down   and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down.
But  you don't necessarily have to say the whole number.
You know you can just say D five one four.
"Well that's what you wanna, so much quicker wouldn't it, just say the Escort D five one four."
"Yeah, you don't even have to say the  the make."
"And then  erm they all get punched into the, Rob's got a special computer programme thing, you punch them all in  er  and then it does a ma a matching thing."
"And it  come, at the end of the day it comes out with all the ones it's matched, the duration it's been there  and er makes it a damned sight easier basically."
Should be quite good.
Then we've got  in June we're supposed to be doing journey time surveys and traffic counts on the M sixty three.
"I won't get off at this one, no?"
No.
I'll get off at the
Erm now they're talking of doing roadside interviews in both directions on the motorway on the slip roads.
"Well,actually  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it"
"Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation"
Yeah.
"and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up"
.
Wonder what ever came of that.
"Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head"
"Yeah, I know , he does versify."
and within three seconds my brain just switches off .
Well I try to
.
"I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany,cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away"
"suddenly cross your legs, ouch ."
That's a good idea.
"She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more."
"I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant  being a mother in law you have to watch it."
", honestly you couldn't be much worse than ."
Oh  mother in law is.
.
She's just .
"I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to , but erm, you know, she,."
"As a person, you know, I'd never have any time ."
"Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money"
", they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane."
"No, of course, of course ."
"So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at  gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the  Christmas present ."
It so .
I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I .
I couldn't I'm afraid.
"Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous"
Why was she?
she didn't want Vaughany to get married again.
"There you can see the staging, and that is where the er wagons came in along here."
More pictures of the roof timbers.
"Outside, that was some stabling I think there."
And er internal roof-work of the stabling.
Just er recessed there to avoid it getting damaged with things passing on the side.
And we're now now walking round the back and er sort of now pointing towards the  Arms.
And you'll notice the er er again the brickwork and the buttressing along there.
"Now having just walked away er up towards erm  er  crossing end, there's the ."
And that's the remains of the cattle dock here.
Er I'm afraid a lot of it had gone by that time.
That was to hang Mr  on.
Or Dr .
"In fact there're two of them, there and one there."
And that's erm  crossing house up there.
And you can see that's where the main tracks where and this is of course where we had er sort of sidings and er other things and er and the main yard.
"Erm odd pictures of the engine shed, taken from somebody's back garden I suppose now."
Er but you can see the er the the engine shed as it was.
Single road.
Accommodate er one locomotive only.
"They normally had here, er just the one erm locomotive  little O four four tank engine, Johnson."
Erm built before the turn of the century.
And and er they also had er normally a little O six O tank er which was er spent a lot of it's time at er a at  at the what is what is now  er Castle.
Er shunting there.
"As I say, that er train would nip off to Nottingham I think every Monday I think it was, and get vacuum cleaned out."
Er and then return.
"what I've never seen, there's the that's the er tank, water tank at the top."
"What I've never seen, is a photograph from the other end."
"If anybody can tell me what was at the other end, apart from a hole, then  not carefully, er I'd be very grateful."
I I guess there was probably a lean to or something like that.
"But er i just don't know, maybe erm a sand store."
"But as I say, I've never seen anything, and I've never been able to find anybody who can provide that answer for me."
"There is a coal truck, that was parked there, and they would load up coal er from there as as necessary."
"I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you  if you want to get drunk  and you want to spend money  then that's fine  but once you step over  that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've   and I've just said nothing because  although you ain't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but"
and then
Yeah
.
there's been disaster tonight  ain't gonna put up with it!
So what he say?
Didn't say anything.
"I said you know, I think you've gotta sort yourself out Lee  and everybody went sort of quiet  but  Paul said  I've never had a rollocking!"
"I said well in all fairness Paul, you ain't actually  bloody got , I said I don't do it for the fun of it  I said and I don't like doing it  but I see, he just sort of"
Well that's silly comment  can't be doing him any good!
I said well the thing  is discipline.
If grandma went
If the transport
into the  she'd  sherry each.
Cor!
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back  Robin is gonna get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck  I shall get it in the neck  and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think
Well then what did he say?
"I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!"
I said but I shall be wrong  for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
"Well he must of had that amount  he must be contin , he must have alcohol in the body  continuously."
"Of course he has  he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night  not Monday night  but  again last night."
So he never gets over it does he?
And he went to bed half past  two.
And got up at four.
"Before then I should think, quarter to four."
I should think he looked like nothing on earth did he?
Yeah.
Well he's gonna kill his self isn't he?
That's right.
So that's what words are about.
Now brr any anybody here like me from Yorkshire?
No you're from slightly further north.
You're from Yorkshire?
Sometime ago
"Sometime ago right so you may catch this, and you're from slightly further north than that I think?"
Right okay.
Anybody from the Liverpool area?
No no okay.
If I said to John and Joanne erm that I saw a boy running up the ginnel no you understand?
You do you do?
Yeah
I know what you said but I dunno what a ginnel is.
Okay a snicket
I don't know what a snicket is either
No
No
Yes
But I know what you're saying
"Alright yeah, okay you see the point that that it's it's words  what the heck's he talking"
No no I know exactly
"Oh you did, yeah it's it's er no but I mean in terms of the actual word you don't know what it is"
No
er it's it's about geography isn't it? er coming from different areas of the country.
Right let me just explain then just just for the sake of completeness.
"erm in the days when they had terraced houses back to back terraced houses erm well anywhere in the country I guess but but where I come from it was fine for the people who lived with their doors on the on the road but the people who lived at the other side of the block they couldn't get from the road so every so often down the down the terrace they had a little alley way  an entry I think you'd probably call it in Scotland, don't they?"
We  talking about this and I was saying about coming from construction I says I've says I've to go up the cut like
Oh the cut yeah
"Where I call the cut, and he's going the cut what cut that's the canal I says  up the cut between  the two the two buildings she said no that's the alley"
"That's the alley, yeah, or the ginnel or the snicket you know or in Liverpool they call it a jigger"
Or the cut
"Yeah so you see the point, if you're making a presentation and you use words like that based on where you come from the geography you know your regional variations then it's a bit it's a bit difficult for er effective communication isn't it?"
"Manhom believes that, believes what basically?"
"They look, er round that line, two three five  two three six  and Face is saying  you're very right sir."
She is a very rare scholar
"describing Doll Collan here, a whore who is seen wandering around the stage most of the time,she is the most rare scholar and has gone mad with studying Brampton's works."
And here but name a word such in a Hebrew she falls in her fit and will discourse her learned genealogies as you would run mad too to  to hear her sir .
"Now, so, Face is trying to sort of put off Sir Epicure Manhom by saying, you know, this a mad woman who's done too much learning  nice little attack on women here by Johnson, who, who  is one of the biggest misogynists in the world, erm  a woman who's gone crazy with learning  and who knows nothing because er she's just a prostitute and therefore she's thick."
Okay?
That's the joke.
"But th again, the funny thing is, even funnier, is that  Manhom lusts after her, gets distracted from this idea of getting all this money and sa saying,how am I going to have conference with her, Lungs ?"
"Erm  and Face said,Oh!"
For a mad woman   acceptance of her .
Okay?
"So, Face promises to get an introduction  to this woman who Manhom fancies and erm  and Manhom, okay."
That is the background.
"Next time we see them  they, they have met and  and Face sends them off to have a private conference."
Okay?
"So you now have act four, scene five."
Enter Doll and th they're talking.
"Will you please try and act it out like we did the Twelfth Night  the bit with Mrs , and see whether you can revive your idea of why  Johnson, what is the nature of, of Johnson's comic art."
Okay.
But hear guffaws  within minutes.
Right.
Do you want me to divide you up?
"Are you,do you want  class ."
You ne need four in a group.
There's gonna be one over so somebody be the walking around peasant.
I don't mind  right now.
Just move my mike.
I think one of you lot's gonna have to go over and join these three over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go on.
"Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams."
All right.
Did you watch that animated version that you recorded.
Yeah.
Does it give you the gist of the story?
"It,half an hour long."
Well I think it's longer than half an hour.
They probably should
an hour at the most.
Given you er  erm
The film is about hour and five minutes.
You can probably have a video of it as long  of another version.
Well it's does help to see different  versions because  you see that different people interpret the
Why do you
Mm?
"Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got  different ways of doing it."
When I was studying  I went to  Open Air Theatre  and  I saw  a version there  on Christopher  er what's his name  that chubby fellow with the glasses  Christopher Biggins that's it.
"He was playing Puck  and when I went to see the  Company  doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er  a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"They did it in a completely  slapstick farce way  you know th the men who were dressed up  women they  balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite  different."
How they
"Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of  of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would  would have a different way of doing it."
Okay.
There's a comedienne  erm  she apparently was born in Wales.
Mhm.
Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her.
Two Ton Tessie?
"She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from  quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had  might well have had a Welsh  nurse."
So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy.
Mm.
"She did it as she would have  thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that."
Mm.
And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet
All round erm it was great.
We had our presence.
It's a very effective direct piece of lobbying and at a time when a lot of people who obviously weren't Green Party supporters behind the campaign.
The cross party campaign for the for the bill which we've written.
So.
the only political party ever to have two pieces of legislation in the House of Commons without having any M Ps.
I'd just like to second that it was a good day and also to point out as the er man who made the postcards we shouldn't get too excited about this as a money making scheme.
Because most of that three pounds thirteen's probably been paid for out hundreds of sheets of cardboard.
So.
But considering considering we were we were
Didn't make a loss.
I held ten fifteen pounds for the privilege.
relation thing.
Every time I do a stall I I quake in my boots up until I do it and then I feel great when we're doing it and afterwards realize that it's been  productive and we we've had a good lot a good response from the public.
So there we go.
Helen do you want to tell us about the next stage?
Yes.
Seeing as we all filled in our postcards ages ago we can write some more letters this week.
Or tomorrow.
I can give you a list of people to to write to.
First of all there's Robert Atkins M P.
This is the man who erm replaced erm Mr Yeo
Oh yes.
with his trousers down.
"Now I think erm Ron  was a bit upset because he spent most of of Christmas sending  Christmas cards and saying, Please please let this bill go through don't give it any ."
"And he said, Oh alright then what's your wife like."
Erm however
No that's right.
Erm Tim erm you know having desi have design?resigned  he was followed by Robert Atkins MP for South Riddle.
Now Mr Atkins former job is as Minister in Northern Ireland so he's unlikely to know a lot about what was going on in the in the Commons at the end of last session which is a bit unfortunate.
He's been hiding under a under an agreement.
He should at least be a very effective man.
"I I I think really they er  they forget that that there's a  quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not  and aren't all that easy  easily persuaded."
"But, having said that  there is  but there are, but there as well!"
"No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see  when you say they're not easily persuaded  that  are working class  that are voting Tory  and they're not easily persuaded they cha"
"Well they did, I"
just changed their mind!
Mm.
Well  having  seen a little bit  erm  was on the other day and I I mean I  I must admit I touch  shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
"A lot of what's erm  you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind."
Yeah.
I'm a loyal supporter!
Well that's it!
And that's it!
"But erm  you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same  a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't  either don't really care"
No!
"or  they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about"
Yeah.
every party!
Yeah.
And making sure I get the right one.
"But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch"
No.
they've already made their minds up  and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on  on basically the choice
On the spur of the mom on the spur
Well
"of the moment, on the day"
think well they've had long enough now we'll  we'll have a switch you know
"Or or the  they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph"
and they'll go and vote for him!
That's right.
"And I mean there's that been that much  publicity about Neil Kinnock  you know, or anti  Neil"
Yeah.
"Yeah, seen that"
and then for   there's this thing  treating people who'd ruined this guy's marriage
Did you tape it?
Yeah.
"the apocalypse and all the people  atheists and   one where ah the Christians, Christians over there please   well I'm sorry to tell you but the jews were right"
Er do you remember the one where ?
"No, he'd gone up to the traffic lights and this cyclist sort of like cycled up, jumped off his bike and wheeled it round the corner so he"
"Yeah, he jumps out"
I like the one  car park
Yeah he got trapped in a car park and he couldn't get out for ages and ages and then as he got out he crashed into another car.
"Ah that's, that's it there."
Well did you see the one where he's getting changed
What's that?
he was getting changed in the car and he put a brick on the pedal and all
"Yes, yes he was going to work and he put the brick on the pedal while he's  jumped in the back pulling on his trousers  and st st steering with"
And cleaning his teeth
steering with his foot.
He gets into the back seat and he's got his feet over the fr the front seat steering with his foot
"Ah that's the same one he's making a lunch or something in, in the park"
Yeah.
The bit where he's on the beach
he's just down to the beach
Yeah.
"and there's this guy sitting  sitting beside him, you know sunbathing and stuff, and er  he doesn't know what to do"
Oh the teacher told us this one.
"he sticks, he sticks the, the"
Trunks.
"the trunks on top of his trousers, unbuttons himself and pulls them down, and he gets, he's er really, really awkward the way he does it and all the rest of it and gets, he finally gets his trousers off, pulls up his er trunks and your man gets up, pulls off his towel, gets out his white stick and"
"Oh he, he went swimming one time and that was pretty good"
"I can't remember what that bit was, I think he just stood on top"
"Yes he crawled, crawled to the edge of the"
Oh that's right and then this wee kid got up and jumped off didn't he?
But they would never take 'em out for day
"No, I know."
"But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and I even today, you cannot buy love."
No.
"And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't even think about  there."
Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Don't think about what.
Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to.
She goes round
Goes round  weeks ago.
"Well, she won't go and stop."
Said she won't go and stop again.
Who's gonna stop then.
When we were all on about stopping
"I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits, she says, I'm not stopping."
Yeah.
"When you were on about that love, what pa was saying about, you know, like every night, that our kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're like, to get hold,I'm lying watching television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put the kids,you know."
"And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum told me,turned round and says to me, I don't want  any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she won't let me have pillow  and then I then I think if summat else  brought to light, I  kill her"
Yeah.
if she had come in
Yeah.
"and that, I know it's a filthy old thing, but it it's comfort ain't it."
Yeah.
"And when they start  let them have the pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get comfortable."
"I know it's a little bit trivial like, but it's just, it's still"
She has queer ways me mother.
"Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me mother out, so, no chance for you working her out, few years you've known her."
"No no, I I, I mean, she's always been alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not  not at all mother-in-law, she's not"
"Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's never been close."
"It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum."
"Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars."
I found this.
And that's looking up towards  up there.
"But the house is in quite good order, it has been extended."
"And that's er from the front view, I didn't go wandering in."
But that was the entrance to the station originally.
"Er  I don't know whether that's listed or not, but er I'm surprised it's still there frankly."
"So as I say, very very very er prominent building."
There's a little weighbridge or or office.
Er in somebody's garden.
And er you can just walk down either side of it.
Er onto the trail.
That's one of the see the old railway building there.
Erm looking up er the er line or that is looking from the bridge erm that's going down towards er th the just it it it er cur curved round to to meet the er the line er an and the s and the station was was here.
Just along the road.
Er that was erm  station just along here.
And that's a line from  between quite er steep er in quite a steep cutting.
"Looking towards  again from the bridge over the main road, er as one gets er near near ."
"Now moving on a little bit further, I know the talk said that I was only going up to er to , but I'm just going a little bit further."
We've cut across the er A six one four here.
Erm at the white post.
"Er and er  the line came from  over here, and on that embankment there was a bridge here, er but they farmer has er removed that embankment, but has still left this part."
And there's some still some one or two rather nice little bridges.
"Er still extant, and er now I rather like the architecture."
Erm and so I wandered up there and had a look at it and photographed.
"Interesting four four arch bricks, and er and and very nice stonework."
"And the copings there, the retaining walls."
"You can see the brickwork there, Nicely done and er very attractive for again for modelling purposes."
"Going a little bit further, I'm only er just a couple here."
"That's up erm near Not a very good picture that, erm but a er L M S eight er eight F, up near  that is."
On a er coal train going towards er towards .
And that's a an L M S crab also at .
"Again on a on a special, going towards Skegness probably, at a guess."
Now what's going the other way?
"There was not the money, we were forced to."
As I say the present day er premier just now is actually trying to do the same thing as a repeat performance
"So sort of erm what was, was there erm any victimizations or anything like that, from the bosses when you went back to work?"
"Oh immediately there was a victimization in the pit,o the pit was out."
Mm.
It was er taken there .
"The grievance was taken to the union, the union just say er told the steward who belonged to that particular pit there, right, just call the men out, that's it."
S so erm did  presumably are quite strong like that then?
Oh oh yes oh yes it was one of the be it still is one of the best unions.
Still is one of the best  for sticking
mm.
Was there erm I've forgotten what I was going ask you.
Er mm were there erm many strikes at the time?
"Oh no, oh no, oh there were all v very few and far be there may have been local strikes but, such as one day er a grievance been put in and the men struck work just for it."
But immediately the  get a result.
"So all our lads are more or less, that was lightning strikes and finish off."
Mm.
One day and it was finished you know?
"Because that would  union, you see?"
Did you work in the pits for a long time?
I was five years in the pits.
Mhm.
"Er eh in er in Lanarkshire and Motherwell, and er at that time, being a young lad  no more between er f er fourteen and twenty, I realized then  that wasn't going to be a life for me."
So I then decided that I would join the army.
Now I joined the army.
"I served my time in both India, Palestine, Gibraltar, Egypt and these sort of places abroad and when I, I  nine months of my colour service to finish, which were a twelve year service,when war broke out in nineteen thirty nine."
I then went er across to France with the B E F. Was in France about nine months approximately when the big invasion started in Poland and through France.
I was taken prisoner of war at Saint Valerie for a few of my friends in from Edinburgh who were taken prisoner of war.
I was taken to a main camp called Lamstor camp in er Polish er German border.
"And er you, you know what happened then?"
I was back down hole again.
"For another five years work, so I served five years in Germany too as a, as a miner."
"And if one goes back er and think about that wages were probably no more than two pounds a week on average, at that time, the er share capital of the Rail Railway I think I'm right in saying, was four hundred and fifty million pounds at that time."
Quite a concern.
"They had hundreds of thousands of employees, of horses and er everything."
Er massive organization.
"And of course if you strip everything that's profitable out of it, like the erm er the railway air services went, erm the er  the er erm hotels, ferries, everything else you can think of, you're left with er with a runt that doesn't make money, and not surprisingly the government then closes it down."
Still I'm mustn't get too political must I.
Er but you know you can always close things if you want to.
"Erm you can fiddle the books, I know that very well."
Another picture  show the  here a little bit here.
"Erm some of the a adverts in er our sort of parish magazines and and so on, er fifty sixty seventy years ago, some of the names,still there."
"Motor Company, well that used er that erm er that's the er ."
"Er  's, well they were well known, very big shop in the town they had."
Erm where Lloyd's is isn't it.
Now then Samuel .
"Some of  's wagons, delivering coal to Mr  's house, well no it was erm  's Manor, it was before Mr  came there."
"Er but erm that was er the Baron's house of course at one time in the eighteen, early eighteen hundreds."
Now a snow scene.
"Samuel , this was taken from an advertisement in one of the magazines, and one sometimes got a little bit of er of exaggeration."
"Er not quite certain how many he had, he had at least one wagon I know that."
"Erm very common, you know s seventy three, twenty five, eighteen, erm they very often started at sort of seventy three or something like that."
To give the impression  before.
Erm I say I don't know how many he did have.
Erm er but that er is a model of one that I made.
Er and er I I think it's a fairly accurate representation.
"Erm that is er four millimetres to the foot, erm so not very big."
But that's on to scale there.
I I work to a pretty  scale on these things.
eighteen point eight three millimetres between the tracks.
"'s  and all the rest of it, and er pictured just by the er er just by the station master's house."
I'll stop in about five minutes if that's alright.
Fine.
"Erm again,L M S yard there, residents  ."
"historically with  what's happened is, the  design from Japan was taken under licence"
Yeah.
and they were based around  and and  designs.
Yeah.
"Now on the five fifty series for example, it's an  complete cartridge spindle on the twelve thousand revs, yeah?"
And we get you know so Anthony  would get that business.
Because complete spindles come under the precision range of products .
Yeah.
This is something I was trying to get clarified but I don't care really as long as somebody gets it.
Erm  but what happened then is er  tended to get the main bearing supply for the normal spindles that  manufactured and built.
Mm.
"And that was a set of three angular contact ball bearings, and then a N N thirty double row roller at the rear."
"Er we're now doing this partnership which was what today was about, about the new generation spindle."
Yeah.
"Erm so that's going great, I think that's really going well so the new design, I think we're well in on."
"Erm the old on that you know, took me two years to get the bearings approved and er you know but then having to wait a year and a half cos  had a year and a half's worth of orders on 'em and promised to hold the price for three years is that's what it took for them to use them up, er has run out, new orders have been put on  but I've got the chance of taking the business."
"Er but erm obviously with the  thing again, I wanted er obviously"
What was the
"you don't to go to 'em for  and they say, well you just took the bloody off me, I want a cut in me ."
Yeah.
This is this is
You know I don't want to be seen to be
This is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not knowingly take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
No at a price below  the existing suppliers ninety four prices.
Now when erm you say  are supplying at the moment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
"The problem is Dave , the buyer at , is worse than Ken   ."
He's a real dipstick.
Yeah?
W his last comment.
"Wh what happened is, Richard  was the team section leader, Dave  historically looks after the bearings sales."
"Then John,, said well didn't you ask her this morning then!"
And Joan says oh no I forgot!
"Well   and even that didn't jog his memory, that he should have asked her to judge it!"
What a dozy !
You know
Who's judging it then?
"Well Mary  going to judge it and, would he let her do it on her own, no  he followed her round, making comments here, making comments there, trying to influence her  fact is, this'll make you laugh, you know the wall displays  you know th erm the books, Where's Wally   Where's Wally  you have this  page, of really tiny little things and you have to find Wally, who's  a person, right?"
Yeah.
"In minute detail, hidden on the page is something, you remember how Simon had books like that"
Yeah.
"In where's Lisa, Where's Freddie, anyway it's Where's Wally, for that  he said er  I think I'll get a picture of somebody  and er course he   I said you gonna call it Where's Wally?"
He said no I'm wanna call it Where's the Wally!
"Milly said  cos we'd been talking about this all day and they, the children had been saying to John  you gonna have a picture of yourself in Where's the Wally thing?"
And erm  Milly said ha can't think of a more suitable candidate  and swept off !
If you don't want the car I'll drive to school tomorrow.
What?
I said if you don't want the car I'll drive Paul and myself to school tomorrow.
"Just thought Mu Mum's got this newspaper so she might,s know some of them photographs."
"Well then it's not fair, use a different newspaper."

Doesn't matter.
You get  yes you do you get pictures of pop stars and that in The

And you can have  my magazines
That's a hard one.
"as well if you want  The Express and The Mail have much the same pictures      Got a  football magazine and a Woman  you can have a football, I can't u look"
Still get some wrong it don't matter anyway does it.
Football will be there for children won't it?
"Yes that's what I mean, I noticed that the man who did it balanced it rather nicely, he had some  actors  some  politicians, that everyone can contribute  especially in a ."
Let er let's hope it'll mm  won't be like that er mm this er this year.
Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas.
Do as I do have turkey instead.

Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour.
Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it?
Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it?
Could anybody bring us a bottle down here  you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York.
It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape.
Has anybody tasted it?
I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call.
I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that.
"Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area?"
No he doesn't know does he?
Er stuff it.
Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they?
Everybody's in there.
"Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room."
Tour buses around York.
Should they be banned?
Should we get rid of them?
Is York a big enough city to have them?
You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic.
I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round?
Why can't they walk round?
"I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier."
What do you think?
Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one.
You can ring now.
exac stop this casual labour business you see?
"Whe whereas the building trade would say oh I'll take you, you're a friend of mine, I'll take you you're a friend of  I can take you, you're a friend ."
"It was  It was  a great lot down in Leith here, and I've often seen it down in Leith docks."
"When I've been down there trying to get casual work, you know in Leith docks?"
"And he just down, they're all in a big crowd ."
"And a chap come out the offices and say right, you you you ."
So in actual fact it was always a favour cos I got the jobs.
"So to stop all that, this is with the b building trade, they had to guarantee them."
So presumably that was quite a popular piece of er legislation?
"Legislation, oh definitely."
Mhm.
"I've had s still operating now to present day, I don't know."
Mm.
What did you do erm after that?
Well as a  reach up up .
"In fact that's what I left from, I left from the job at job street in George street with the building trade."
That's when I .
And I  work after that.
"But the site  prepared to let me work, to carry on then as s they ma and I wouldn't claim my pension until I'd finished."
"And behind that, their reasoning for that is, for every year that I worked over my retir retireable age, there's a  that is added to my pension."
He says I  haven't got you working long  longer I worked the bigger the pension I have when I go out .
So were you allowed to work er after your retireable age?
"Not, not at that particu when they got to hear about it."
Mm.
"Of course they, they had questions of  and he says oh well I've sat with him, the man's prepared  working at Lambert, but no you can't allow the man to work after he's sixty and that was it."
So that was me on.
But the OAPs
Were you involved in any erm political parties or anything er ?
"No no not necessary though, though I have done quite a wee bit just now er in support of my Labour Party, you know?"
"Done quite a wee bit and I've been there at a few of their, quite a few of their meetings and erm a good friend of quite a few of the councils."
And Lothian  District Council.
Quite a good friend of them you know and I'm a close contact with them.
I didn't have to say anything.
"I said to him  I don't know, he said  did you enjoy yourself Tuesday?"
"Oh I said, did you see us?"
Oh yeah we saw you.
And his dad's nice.
Yeah.
But that other bloke was there but he wasn't in his normal place.
Yes
Why wasn't he in his normal place?
Palace played really well.
"The first twenty five minutes, when you think we were one nil up right I thought gosh  if we could get that second goal it would have made all the difference and United would have been really would have been in trouble."
Was a good game though.
"Oh I enjoyed it, yeah."
"Just don't enjoy Palace losing, but   sheer football   and it just shows you that ironically the two games can match each other and there were chances for Palace to wrap that game up."
But er  when they do play that ball to ball  business erm
Yeah.
we look like we've got huge spaces in our  in our midfield.
"I mean  that's what teams are doing now, they're realizing that's where all our weakness is in midfield  so  don't take a er a hefty boot and try and er er  people like Thorn and  I mean Thorn and Young were impeccably  they played beautifully today."
"You cannot ask Thorn and Young, I've never seen two players play  they do, they did th , they do the simple thing  but they do it consistently well."
"Over and over again, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty times in one match and they'll make one mistake and usually like Coleman was there to c , I think Coleman backed up well and Gareth  backed up well once or twice."
But defence wise  superb.
"Absolutely su , there was a lapse with that guy, don't know who was to blame about that third goal but I mean"
It was Young.
Er Young let it plop over
"Oh, didn't see who it was."
"It was like, it was like a, like they were waiting for an offside or some there were just couldn't believe, it was"
But it was the same when Palace scored and exactly the same thing happened didn't it?
Why do they lapse?
It's weird.
"Yeah, it's  well they do say both sides that it's the most dangerous time straight after a goal."
"I mean often, times you see teams equalize immediately."
"You know it's like, you sometimes you can go a whole game like seventy minutes of a game and no-one's had a goal scoring chance"
"Cos that's what happened to Brian, you know when Brian had his Orion nicked?got stopped in"
the cars or something?
Little Sutton  cars.
"And then, it's taking him ages to get"
Has he got it now though?
Yeah.
But er the things that they were doing were just unbelievable.
Erm you know to get the chassis numbers and that.
"buying old  say a scrapped  a written off Sierra you know, picking them up cheap for about a thousand quid from the scrappy"
Yeah.
"and then getting all the  the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and    Because what, you know, er Siobhan's dad had a, bought a Montego  and  I don't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it's had a Maestro engine in it and it had  this that and the other."
And er they had to repossess it and he was paying .
"And I don't know how, what's happened about it now but at the time he was still having to pay for it"
Mhm.
even though they'd taken the car.
"there was a woman there that erm  the  police do this service thing where they'll look a car over for you, if you bought a car that you know has been er  in an accident and it's been"
Yeah.
they will have a look at it over  and check it over.
"And there was a woman on it, she had a really nice Orion, a J reg."
"Anyway when they  had a good look at it the front half was an Escort  and the back half was an Orion, half a stolen car."
You know they hadn't even matched the same bloody  type of car.
There's not really a lot of difference though is there between
There is
"Well there isn't and I I said to Mike what did it look like, you know?"
He said it was nice.
But when they're doing these welding jobs they haven't got them on those things so  as they're doing it like it's all moving and
Yeah.
Yeah they're totally
it was just a complete bodge.
I if you're driving along you can throw out the balance of the car.
Yeah.
"Well it was that erm one in Manchester, that crash  you know there was three people killed in the middle of Manchester wasn't there?"
Your mad!
"What is it though, what's historical linguistics?"
Is it like what we do in Old English or not?
Cos that
Yeah it is.
That sounds excellent.
Right it's due in week three I think.
Hurray.
"Er but  as far as I'm concerned if it comes in in week four, that's fair enough, but things after that then they start to get a bit upset"
"But I sa I said to Chris, When is it?"
"She said, Week three."
"Er and I said, Give or take a few days, and she said, Yeah."
"So if it's inside week four then that will quite reasonable, does that sound okay?"
Okay has anyone had a think about what they want to do?
I mean does anybody else know?
sort of everything we've had so far's been pretty general.
Okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder  and people have a listen to it.
But obviously if you're going to do that you'll have to do it during next week some time  On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one.
Yeah Oh yeah I mean there's five five things five things in men or women's conversation t to do and essay about.
"Say one about interrupting, one about topics, and one about perhaps interaction with children, one about er  what    Or you could even I mean if I did er I did a list of that you could even do the same one, you wouldn't have to do one each."
You know you got your erm tag questions?
Yeah.
might not be one of the question in it as  tag questions could be
Oh yeah.
specific.
Okay er  There's one title I've got written down here which I don't know if anyone's interested in.
Evaluate the claim that women are more d ob Evaluate the claim that women are more observant of the prestige norms in their speech than men are.
Does anyone fancy that?
Let's If I write down   Okay the  which I've just suddenly thought of were er
"turn-taking and interruptions and overlap and tags and tag questions, topic selection and interaction with children, which I think I just mentioned make sure you've got them down so we can forget them."
Er
What?
Where they'd come from?
On some cases yes because I was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber.
Well that er er er an Englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser.
As a man's hairdresser.
But somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no.
But that's what he's he told you?
Oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser.
And you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people.
Mm.
Too and who knows how they went to the road.
Mm.
Did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or.
It's said nowadays about drink but I don't know.
They they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know.
Mm.
So something just peculiar at that very time put them to the.
Did they ever do any form of casual work?
S some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the ar in in the harvest time.
Yes oh some would w w work but some wouldn't.
Er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub.
Mm.
What type of work did they  ?
Well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time.
And they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay.
Oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds.
And you wouldn't say oh I think it's going to be wet today John you better stay.
Not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it.
And were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character
Yes.
who sold goods
Oh oh yes er er who who sold.
Er there was one chappie that  er erm I can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap I suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite.
"Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now ."
But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll  put the answer phone on .
I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever.
Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with.
Is your's rude.
No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable
I  I
"and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down."
I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds.
And do they?
Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever.
I should've just say you're bragging.
"Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife?"
Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know.
So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere?
No no hon
There's not.
Any chips out there ?
Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not.
Okay.
I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm .
It sounds about par for the B B C.
"Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well  it's knackered er erm."
What?
Sorry.
I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it?
Yeah.
Okay er
Can the B B C afford these phone calls?
I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back.
Oh well you can call me back.
Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there?
And the  where the meeting of the day is at Lingfield Park.
First race there twelve twenty because there are eight races so an action-packed good value afternoon there.
An eighth of an inch of rain overnight but that shouldn't make any difference at all but a wet windy day.
No reported hazards.
Doesn't look a brilliant day does it weatherwise at the races  clouds.
Wetherby by the way  Tuesday third annual charity meeting in aid of the International Spinal Research Trust.
It's on Tuesday sixteenth of November.
A lot of local people have certainly er given generously so should be a good day's racing.
Always is at Wetherby if you can win there you can win anywhere.
But what about the guy who's won the Channel Four champion tipster competition for last week?
Let me first of all give you his name and I'll tell you what this guy's damn brilliant.
It is Robert  from  road in  in Oxfordshire who got an amazing a hundred and thirty points.
Now I say amazing let's just see where he got his winners.
"Now  that okay no problems there,second and third but look at this, he gave the first second and third and they didn't even have a handicap."
"Er the  Looking for a Rainbow, Flight Lieutenant, all skill of course, well you deserve that."
Well done Robert  and you get five hundred pounds.
We'll have another champion tipster competition in a fortnight here on Channel Four which will be coming from Newcastle.
Now let's test your turf knowledge as we go into the commercial break.
This er turf trivia today has been sent in by S  who comes from Great Lumley in County Down.
Know it well.
"He asks quite simply  with which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson Gold Cup four years running in nineteen sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one?"
You get scratching those  heads and I'll give you the answer in three minutes from now.
Okay did you get it right?
"With which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson in sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one four years running."
"They were  Jupiter Boy, Gay Trip, Chatham and Gay Trip again."
What an incredible performance that was.
Three different horses won it four years running.
The late and much missed Fred Rival By the way I saw Mercy at the horse of the year show a few weeks ago.
Still looking as good as ever.
"Erm  non runners, non runners there were three in so far, two of them were at Cheltenham."
They are Far Senior in the first in the twelve fifty and Panto Prince did not run in the Mackeson at two o'clock.
And Canderbill is out of the one fifteen at Nottingham.
Matters arising proposed and seconded that they be accepted  recommendations
"Yeah  no no, because there was no matters arising."
Just put that on so you can  proposing and seconding .
"Confusing, isn't it?"
"No, not really!"
Right
Secretary's report
Can we have the secretary's report.
Yeah.
"Erm  secretary's report, it's much the same as last year  er, we had two trips  this year  two coach trips  one to the Yorkshire Aquarist Festival in Ap was it April?"
"I think it was April, wasn't it?"
And one to the British Aquarist Festival in October.
"They were both enjoyable  erm  I can't really say which I enjoyed the most  er, I thought they were both very good  and of course good value for the money  because they don't charge very much for the fares  well I don't think they do."
"Erm  then we had the  three-way inter-club  table show  with Hulton and Skelmersdale and St Helens  erm  the first one was  St Helens  and that was the only  wasn't it, about April  and we won that  we, we  it was a whitewash really, wasn't it?"
"Erm  then we had one at Sk Hulton in July  and we won that  er, not quite as much of a whitewash was it?"
Nevertheless we won handsomely.
And the third one was at Skelm
Which was not organized because we don't know anyone
"which was   we don't know who won  we don't know what the score was but we think that   but we're, we're assuming that that's because they bring out all their secret showmen  who don't sh travel  they have a little core, hard core of  that don't travel  but they, they bring them out"
"they bring them out at their own table shows and, and it's"
Appropriate that we should  that much
Well that appears to be so .
I never cared for results  never cared for results at all.
Robert is
We never saw a fish either.
No.
"I don't think erm  on reflection, I don't think that a three-way table show is a good thing."
"I would prefer to see an inter-club with Skelm and an inter-club with Hulton I think they get too big, two clubs is too difficult to organize when there's three  cos you, you're getting  it's not , it's the"
It's not that   the show secretary was er  at  club  had not done his job.
At Skelmersdale?
Yeah.
I mean he's in the auction when he should be with them  writing the labels.
"It's not how many stocks and shares they've got, it's not what the size of their balance is, how much they've got on deposit account, how much credit, how credit worthy they are, that is not the richness of a man or a woman."
"Here the wise man says, the blessing of God, it makes a person rich  and it does not bring sorrow with it."
It's a strange verse.
Put it to the back of your mind a moment please.
"As I turn in to the book of Genesis I read there of God coming to Abraham, and saying to Abraham,that Abraham in your family all the nations of the world are gonna be blessed !"
How is that blessing gonna come?
It comes through the Messiah.
"It blessed the  for Abraham, the Messiah."
Jesus.
Because we become  middle class?
Because we've become better off?
Of course not!
We are blessed in him because he gave his life for us.
That is the source of God's blessing.
"Not in getting, but rather in giving."
"The apostle Paul when he's writing to the Corinthians in his first letter to them, one Corinthians  ."
Well what is this?
What's the definition?
"I suppose if I come around and ask each one of us this morning, can you give a definition?"
"I'm writing a dictionary and I'm stuck on a word, I want the definition of blessing."
"And I suppose for every person here, there would be a  I would say a similar, but a different er definition."
"There'd be a lot of similarity to it, and I think if we're honest  a lot of it would come back to things."
Well let's see what God himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing.
Gives it to us in psalm a hundred and thirty three  and it's in the last verse.
He is talking about God people being in unity.
"And he says, as a result of them being in unity, dwelling together in unity, he says it is there that the Lord commanded the blessing."
Whatever that is!
And it gives the blessing for what it is.
Life forever.
That is God's blessing!
That is God's blessing to you.
That is God's blessing on me.
"Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's  erm   he's got a  he's gotta go at four  actually go at four not  an appointment, he's gotta go at four."
Why erm  why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
"Well I don't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent."
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Well it's erm  the sort of things they pick them on really is not that
Not hygiene sort of thing?
"No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to  know what they're talking about but  I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room"
Mhm.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's gotta go on a special one?
It's gotta go on a steel pallet  and yet next door  in the export chiller  they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet  and we work on wooden pallets  erm
I'm surprised they use wood.
Well if you see how many pallets they got  and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery  they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
"Yeah I suppose they would, yeah."
There's loads of things they're on about  oh th the there's a whole  book what they gotta h have sorted out.
Do they?
Oh Christ yeah!
"Certain doors are not to be opened  things like emergency exits there's  they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door don't even open."
Bloody hell!
So all that stuff
"Well then that is, that's gotta be sorted out because if you"
Yeah.
"had a fire there, somebody wouldn't get out properly!"
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we haven't got an emergency exit.
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
"Well there's a bloody great  roller door, but you see it's at the end  we work"
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
Well exactly!
How would you get out?
And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in.
And the information's recorded on the cartridge.
And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel  is
Yeah.
"and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever."
Ah.
"So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine  you know."
"But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside"
Yeah.
obviously but I think you need  clearly in the first instance to use that
And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got
"Well I, it's just a thought."
I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether
Yeah.
"just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some  origin destination surveys  interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it  that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere."
"Erm  and erm  you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones  census point and so on"
Yeah.
"and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem."
Yeah.
Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them.
"Cos presumably, when you look at the layout  most of the signs are keep left signs."
Yeah.
Or you get the  you get ones that are sort of road narrows
Yeah.
"and you get the, the warning ones."
Yeah.
And the warning ones have a little census  plate on.
Erm  so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that.
But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they?
Yeah.
"So the only ones you really need  and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock."
Yeah.
Lets.
Stack them high and sell them cheap.
Erm oh we'll they're going to go for twenty P plus cost of the stamped addressed return envelope
Yeah.
friend.
Which is slightly more  than some people   do with their money.
Erm  where are we.
Oh yes orders to receive letter box stickers.
"Erm  Lisa is that  I'm not quite sure, from the York University student rooms, is  in to help us with the big box pile up."
And having spoken to her on Saturday when she came along to the energy conservation stall I intend to invite her if it's alright with the meeting to our next meeting which is on the ninth of February to discuss how the Greens can help how the University Greens can help us with that demonstration.
And perhaps forge a link you never know.
So if that's that's approved I'll give that a tick and so we can bring it up again later.
Great.
Erm I've also received information on conference accommodation and on the billboards but I've billed those as separate items so that you don't listen to me half off all evening.
That's it.
Okay.
Do we have a treasurer's report in absent here?
No he's absent.
He's .
But I do have something from the membership secretary.
Right so that's other officers.
membership secretary.
"Well the membership secretary, if I can remember how to spell it, erm mm has indeed been in touch with erm John  who very kindly sent us a free copy of erm their version of our membership list."
Which is how we found out that one that we have a new member erm Sally  who I'll add on to my list and er send a newsletter to.
Also Joan  Ian  and Mrs Green  erm we all thought they joined locally and the national party have no record.
It's the same old story.
Erm John  has suggested that we send their membership on and then that's definitely it.
We're now all up to date and we agree with head office and we can take it from here.
Erm one minor alteration on that point.
I've got a membership card for  possibly er previous
From January.
sort of yeah from the end of January's er
"Right, that's the other element, it's what you think they think you should be doing and it's amazing how few people, yeah that's the  yeah"
"I  talking about, but that's what job specs are all about."
"It might seem long-winded, but dependent upon er if you get it right at the start with it, it might mean that one of the things we're suggesting er you might say no, it's not for me this, but you might think that job analysis is a good way of identifying training."
What they've gotta do and why they do it.
What's the starting point for job analysis do you think?
What's the first thing you've gotta identify?
"Yeah, the need for the job er  er  yeah, not, not quite exactly what I'm looking for,the way of the trainer's dilemma isn't it?"
"I've got an answer for that it's not quite right, what shall I do?"
"Can I just say no, shut up."
Or should I and this is all part of it isn't it?
Cos he won't say anything to me if I don't know what's wrong
erm won't say anything else will he?
What  results
"Yeah, alright."
"Yeah okay, so we're looking for results."
The results of this person why are they employed.
So the results that we expect out the job.
If you get results it could earn a job analysis what would we do?
"If I, if I was a job analysis person, what will I  sit next to you wouldn't I and what would I have missed out?"
"Right, yeah."
Another word for main responsibilities.
"Mm, you're testing me today aren't you!"
Right.
Key  tasks  What is the person's key task?
This is difficult stuff I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this  because it's covered on various other courses as well.
"Things like appraisal skills er level one level two, various others, other courses that we run."
"There's your job  the first thing I should do is say well what are the key tasks, what are the areas that would mean results?"
Perhaps a working demonstration might highlight something I'm trying to .
Take the job of a receptionist.
Who's been a receptionist?
You have haven't you Elaine?
Yes
"Well I can draw the E I P to a close, sorry?"
Why?
Do we?
"Mr Mr Donson, yes, oh that's right, we posed a question to you on the elephant analogy."
What is the equivalent on affordable housing?
"I thinking about it over erm er coffee sir, I I I think the answer is an adder erm because its smaller than an elephant, it's indigenous to the United Kingdom, it blends into the landscape, but if you ignore it it could be just as injurious to your health."
Excellent.
.
Well with that I think I can draw the E I P to a close .
Can I say it it's er we've had a a good day from my point of view anyway.
"Erm some days have been better than others but I I I have in retrospect enjoyed it,heartbroke though it is."
"Er and from our point of view er erm the panel, erm this is only the end of the beginning for us because we've got a lot of other work to do."
Er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions.
"I'm also particularly grateful for, and I said yesterday, to our two friends in the right hand corner here who've er done some sterling work."
I'm grateful to North Yorkshire and through you to the Strensall people for the arrangements and the use of the Village Hall and I think I must commend Mr Whipp for his fortitude through the last week or so.
Because even if he wasn't participating he was sitting listening.
Thank you very much.
"Chairman before before you do finally er pack your bag and zoom off back to wherever it is you're going, could I on behalf of the county council and all of our participants here today and those who've been around in the last fortnight thank you and Miss Whittaker and your assistant able assistants er Mrs Binns and Dave  in the programme office for the sterling work they've done."
And for making the E I P erm an interesting and er fortnight and I think er commending on the way that you er and your colleagues have handled it er all the way through and er we hope that er at the end of the day we'll get something back from you fairly quickly which er we'll act upon.
I won't promise
Thank you very much Chairman.
I shan't promise before Christmas..
Hiya.
Hello.
Oh oh here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.
Well Miss  come and have your head cut off.
Erm
She's got asthma.
Right.
Mhm.
comprehensive list.
New recruits ask them  what a good idea.
"Charts of  asking questions, if people come to you and ask questions keep referring the same things  similar things to you all the time."
Perhaps it's cos they don't know the basics.
What sort of errors do they make?
Persistently make errors and the same  with it.
"Complaints from other departments and complaints from members of the public, changes in job spec er new technology perhaps er   backlogs that, people always have a backlog don't they?"
"Is it cos they're lazy, often think it's cos they're lazy don't they?"
I think it's often because people are always  and then it always gets put to the bottom of the pile.
Things they're not so sure about .
"Perhaps might not be it, can't, you can't wave a magic wand and say everything's  but they might not."
Body language can suggest you have  like jumping out a window or hanging themselves or whatever.
"Promotion, succession planning."
"We do enough succession planning in C U  you know it's magic you know, you know number two like it's smashing number two it's still you know, you know young children, number two has a different connotation to what it does here, but definitely if you are a number two here, it means the same to what a child thinks it is, but I"
"er, and appraisals."
All  all packets that we can use to identify  I really do need people to talk to me.
"Alright, so that's a brief out overview if you like of some of the errors that we can do."
Let's go a bit more specific  Job analysis.
We do the first bit who needs to be trained  what do they need to know is the second
"Yeah, so what they need to know and why  forms a heading Job Analysis."
Where do you get your job analysis from?
Personnel.
What?
Personnel.
Personnel.
"Okay, has anyone seen their job spec?"
Does it actually give you any training  on it?
It's very broad isn't it  yeah.
Erm
Oh no it's the same sort of thing you're told it when you
You're told it aren't you?
It tends to be blocked up in somebody's mind what you do.
"That is being taken to good money they say, it was the professional's choice yesterday the faces were all backing it yesterday."
"The five to one will last to the end of the ten minute guarantee at the shops, it will then go four and by the  General Pershing could be as low as seven to two or a hundred to thirty according to Ladbrokes."
Hills have had erm  each way for  Nephew and Our Margaret but the focus of the betting today with this rain coming at Cheltenham is going to be Gordon Richard's General Pershing and he's gonna go off a short price.
Is your money going to be on the favourite?
Er my money's gone on Storm Storm Alert about ten days ago at twelves and
Mm.
that's almost certainly enough to nail it to the floor I would have thought.
Are you worried that you were obviously worried about this rain as well?
Er likes it likes the ground.
It needs the ground.
Mhm.
And I've said that you know I'd rather it was on the soft but whether it will get
Yeah.
the trip or not we'll find out this afternoon.
It's gonna be a cracking good race at  too.
But what about the other race meetings today?
Let's have the early news.
Oakes.
Yes.
Wind's up.
"There's no danger of the river rising so fast  it floods the course as it sometimes does but sadly  as you can see, rain overnight and it's raining now."
And do watch out for those roadworks on the M four just by the M twenty five junction.
Well at Nottingham as well as first race twelve forty five there's a wedding.
The prospective Mr and Mrs Martin are celebrating their wedding in a private hospitality suite and as well as er entertaining their guests they're sponsoring the Andy and Tracy wedding day novelties chase.
And they have a runner in .
So all the very best to them.
"The going however whether their horse will like it or not is good from good to firm and there's a non runner in the one fifteen that's number one urgh Canderbill, there we go."
That's about a third of an inch of rain overnight and again it's gonna be wet for the rest of the day.
When you go into the course follow signs for Colic Park.
celebrating your wedding with  Chase but this is Ayr and it's the only dry spot in the British Isles.
There was no rain overnight so that the ground er is good with just a few soft places.
No hazards on the roads.
"And the same in most of our organizations in this country at the present day, and that's what's wrong."
It's holding them back.
"When you've got a left, a right and a centre, you've got three different parties within a party."
So the Labour Party got united then at that time?
"Oh definitely, very well united, yes."
Then.
"But don't forget that was just after the war and er the Labour were beginning to build up, getting things better, run better country than they were  previous p people."
Did the Labour Party gain a lot of support after the war?
"Oh yes, aye they did oh."
"Oh aye proved it, they got in."
E eventually they got into parliament.
"Erm now did your er Labour Party membership lapse after, after that time?"
Er yes it did lapse.
"Because I had seen my young brother-in-law and I says I'm gonna be like that then, didn't fe er feel any of this er at that time."
"Me,as the district council."
I couldn't see myself doing it so as I said I wasn't going to make a fool of myself by putting my name as being nominated forward er as a candidate etcetera  lose interest  that's the first thing that happened because they knew I was an outspoken bloke.
"I knew  spoke too much  next nominee, next candidate for ."
"And I felt it wasn't up to them, I didn't have enough experience I wanted to gain some more experience but it just fell away, lapse."
"And erm you're, you're not a member of the Labour Party again?"
No I'm not a member of the Labour Party yet.
Oh.
"You see the pre the present system we've got  Scottish Old Age Pensioners is non sectarian, non political."
You understand?
Is this er does that actually debar from belonging to er
"Oh I could have er er well it doesn't debar me but I feel it, it would it wouldn't be right, for me being a Labour Party member sitting on a, a non-segregated and non-political gr er ah association,"
Mhm.
"Now er you, you mentioned your, your pensions association."
"Now you're area treasurer, aren't you, for the"
"Area treasurer, er Edinburgh area"
Can you tell me a bit about the organization and what its aims
"Well the aims  I'll just read this  and this says, this gives you most ."
This   the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association.
"she was nearly retired, Billy"
"she was nearly retiring by the, no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for, two or three years after we came up here, but I would be in the choir just, maybe two or three years."
And then it
And did it
"it fell the choir fell folded up ,"
Folded up and she
"Aye, oh"
retired?
There was nobody else took it on.
Was there a church choir going at that time then?
"Yes, aye there would be, just the same ladies that have s been in it for years."
"But there were men in it for quite a while, I was wondering when that kind of faded out."
Oh that was faded out before
That was a good while before
Aye before we came up here.
"I wonder if, it Mr, was it  choir or his father or something that had it, I can if I can remember somebody saying."
So what was going on in the way of entertainments and things like that when you came to  ?
When I came up to live here?
"There was quite a few dances, in er, do you mean dances in the Town Hall?"
"Ah there would be  there well just one or two, not not every week or anything like that as far as I can remember."
Just a few over the winter?
"Just aye, aye, oh they didn't have them in the in the summer, and of course in them days well the  the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and"
It's hardly worth having a dance .
It's not worth having a dance.
"But I heard the Town Hall was having one, not the Town, was it the Town Hall or Community Council having one between, I think it's the Town Hall, between Christmas and New Year and really I don't think it's worth their while  having them then."
Do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a=less dances and things then?
Do you mean the bars being op oh I think
And clubs.
I think so really
Do you think it's the main thing ?
"I think that's what's really, it's killed them  as far"
Mhm.
He should know about them shouldn't he?
"Well we must  that's why, certainly have to, before"
Could you drag him along  to a meeting?
Yeah well that's what  they said we could do that.
I'll write that down.
"Erm, is that okay for that I just have something that I read in New Scientist does everybody take it?"
No
Oh well I'll give you one to look at  it's just a little article about
Thank you.
recycling in in Egypt.
And I just liked reading it so much that I thought you'd like to read it too.
Don't have to read it now cos it's quite long.
It's it's  it's really hot  .
Cos they they reuse absolutely everything.
And they make they're living out of it.
In East German they are now drowning in rubbish because  they used to have a perfect recycling scheme  everything was collected and recycled cos they just didn't have the materials.
Now they are flooded with the West European goods  their recycling isn't worth any more.
On the other hand they haven't got the landfills and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they   I mean it's a health  hazard meanwhile.
One of the major problems they have to face.
Far East  lots of guys sort of collecting cardboard boxes and that's all they did they flatten down cardboard boxes and then another one did newspapers and whole newspapers and
The whole town is composed of a
Yeah.
it's like a big .
I just thought it was  interesting.
Erm  I did write er as was suggested asking about  erm facilities for cyclists in the potential  shopping centre development in Bishop's Stortford.
"And they are, they are interested in cyclists but from what I could make out reading this  they're not really going to help us a great deal."
If you want to pass it round and read it.
It's it's they're gonna use the green wedges that are already there and the existing footpaths which are already cycled along.
"What, what good is that to me?"
It's just  in Stortford it's not that easy for a cyclist is it?
No
And they've got all the places  say don't lean your bicycle here and you're not allowed to take it into Jackson
"all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens."
"Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are closed ."
.
"Apart from religion or anything else, you know."
"Yeah,."
Yeah.
"It, I think it's nicer when, when it"
"Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful."
"That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing around"
"Just be like a Saturday ,."
"we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really"
No.
it won't be a weekend.
No
"And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they?"
"Well the big ones are, yeah."
Yes.
Oh yes.
"There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as  ."
"But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel."
Yes.
Mm.
"Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re he reckons on Sunday"
Yeah Sunday morning .
.
"But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back."
"We do, we don't buy ."
"Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back."
"Mm, mm."
"And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box."
"And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it"
"Oh yes indeed, indeed , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one."
Before we get bogged down.
"I haven't received the samples, er oh sorry I I'll moving on to what we're talking about."
The National Party are mounting a poster campaign for the elections.
For both elections which hope hopefully covers the Euros and the er locals starting at the beginning er towards the end of the local election campaign to running through to the  June.
And they said erm if you would like to see the designs write and ask for a sample so we wrote and I haven't actually received any samples yet.
But I have had a letter erm explaining where the billboards are in our area and how much they cost.
It's a very badly written letter actually.
"For one thing it starts,Dear Mrs Knightingale  which got my back up."
"Erm and then it goes on to say,Please find the enclosed the postal sites available in your area Miriam   who's the Green Party person who's organizing it  has provided the required areas and if you need any more details please don't hesitate to call me or my secretary."
And under the sites  may also  availability at the time of booking.
I look forward to hearing from you with your selections .
But introductory letter aside erm  interesting.
Can I just get clarification here?
Yes.
That letter almost sounds like we us around this table are expected to choose some of the sites.
Yeah.
We didn't just write for information as to what National Parties
"Erm well I just wrote Miriam and said, I saw your article in Green Week can you send me further details."
And this is what's happened so.
What it transpires is local parties who are interested enough get what's
Yeah.
get to try and choose site.
Right.
Erm now then it gives us a erm a price here which I think is weekly.
Because the availability columns are weekly so it makes sense that the price means weekly.
Erm and it has a number of different types W and F .
But if I run through the addresses I think it'll make sense because everybody will recognize where they are.
Erm in York Holgate Road which is twelve pounds a week.
Hundred and ten Fishergate which I think is the side of Jacksons that's fifteen pounds a week.
Erm in fact there's two there.
East Parade eighteen pounds a week.
Tang Hall Lane eighteen pounds.
If ones came as  in little wee pi pickups we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something.
This was during the mid thirties?
Oh yes I would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah.
Coming more that
How about the individual er tramps?
Did you ever have bye-names for these characters?
Well th th there was one Joe Wrench.
Er but I don't know what's that.
But somebody so told me aye and I said that was a funny name or was it else's then.
Well I said I remember a man called Joe Wrench and but er oh I wouldn't er but one  said oh Joe Wrench is very black looking.
Well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says I turned the hose on him.
Well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road.
So there was a bit of
Mm.
among the few people that saw that happening.
But er he was quite a character the man that did that.
Did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them?
No well I could never say I I was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen
Mm.
in his bag.
Well I think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another
Mm.
jacket in the bag.
So whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that.
They wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er.
No oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see.
And when they were coming along Lochassynt were they making for anywhere in particular?
We we well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by Nedd and  and probably Scourie they were just doing their circular.
Aye they had their places for.
Yes it's amazing aye.
And did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds?
Who they were in fact?
Yes it is.
Yeah.
To that charge Shaun David  do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Worships if I may interrupt the the this erm dispute about the  damage  which was  allegedly caused  I have mentioned it to Miss  this morning and she has  undertaken to make further enquiries.
"Erm  briefly, the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels  and Mr  denies that he broke  the second of the two, the one at the front door he says was broken  at some time earlier  on the evening on which he was involved."
"Unfortunately Miss  hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries  er, to  apportion the damage  and to take instructions as to the  the residue of what I've just said."
"It is suggested er, by both myself and er  my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week."
"Well it, it was adjourned last week for him to  with instructions your worship."
Yes we we've adjourned this case for one week  other enquiries can be made.
"So he doesn't have to, on conditional bail today?"
Well bail will be extended for one week.
"Well you know what that means Mr , you were told  this last week you will be  to surrender yourself to bail  next Tuesday at er ."
Hopefully the matter will proceed next week.
Can we go your worships?
"Yes, you can leave the court."
Case number one your worships please  Peter John .
Are you Peter John ?
That's right.
What's your date of birth?
Nineteen of the first sixty three.
What's your home address Mr ?
.
"You are charged with an offence which is contrary to section six of the road traffic act in nineteen seventy two  in  Wallby on the ninth of September  drove a motor vehicle  on  the A six seven one  Wallby by pass  having consumed alcohol  in such a quantity that the proportion of it, in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit."
Do you understand?
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Have you got your driving license with you Mr ?
"I haven't got it actually, no."
Why?
"Because, well I told the police at the time  that er  I've misplaced it  and er  my  is."
"What are you doing about getting er, a replacement?"
Well I haven't done anything at the moment because I di I didn't think it was worth it actually.
"Erm but the idea that someone is putting it all down, all those private conversations, all those tensions, and it's all being recorded, not to present the historic truth, but to present the truth as the person wants history to read it."
"That's what always happens, they're self serving, self pleading, self justifying."
Er perhaps they're helpful to the historians because they can then put them all in a room.
"Although I must say I I mean, one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in, was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident."
And people were very kind about the quality off the speech that I made that that did it.
I believed she was one hundred percent right.
I believed then and I believe now.
I must make that absolutely clear.
"But I had to get together in one room, the admirals, the intelligence people, the civil servants, all the people who'd played a critical role in advising her."
"It was only six months before, they couldn't agree."
I wonder what each of their memoirs would look like.
So what about mrs Thatcher's memoirs?
The timing.
"Well I glanced Yeah, yeah."
"You know, look, I did a deal with Mrs Thatcher in nineteen eighty six, that I wouldn't open up many of these issues, and if she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
But she hasn't.
"As far as I'm concerned, personally, so far, she has."
What was the deal then?
That I wouldn't pursue the issues of nineteen eighty six.
"And I I haven't I  with the No it's very simple, I left it to the select committees of the House of Commons."
"But we're talking about now, we're talking about Mrs Thatcher having written"
I  deal
a set of memoirs er critical of the Prime Minister while he's still in office .
Erm er I'm she hasn't been critical of me.
No but she's been critical of lots of other people.
Well we don't know for sure yet about what she's said about you.
Do we.
If
"That's what I said, If she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
S But but y what what you're saying is that if someo Have you seen the book by the way?
Have you read the book?
Right .
"Awfully sorry love, have to er dash off a bit"

and as Martin is still giving out
"I think I'll have you Christopher please to read yours about monster, so I'll have the two monster ones first and then the two home ones."
"Right, just sit down for a minute and let's, Michael read his first."
The monster from the marsh.
I saw the monster arrive from the marsh  he looked at the   when I saw him I ran
The monster from the marsh.
"When I was walking past the marsh one, one night, when I was on my way back from school I heard a rus rustling noise behind a bu bush, when I went up the, went up first to the bush a big dragon-like thing jumped out from behind the bush, it gave me such a fright I nearly fainted."
"I started to run up, straight up the hill, erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and  sticking out of the crowd and he tripped over and after  the end"
My home.
"My home is near the trees and I live there  in, in my house there is"
I have lots of places in my
and I have one  one pigeon and a dog.
"My home is made of wood,"
and the roof is made of tin and the colour of it is grey.
"It has two doors, one, four windows, I, I don't have the garden or, oh, in my house there are six rooms and one of them is er, one, one of them is my, is my room and a picture and a"
"my  my, and"
room and er
My home.
"I live in a tree so does my mum  tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and dad live there."
Our house is made of wood and is dark green.
"We have four windows and four doors, we have got a  there is a big hill in front of it and it is good, but if it, if the tree house   because we find the, the trees and then  and then we were, we play in the tree house sometimes with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture, we have four rooms, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen"
Right then.
"I like erm, Christopher  and Simon"
"yes I know, take your books and show"
"right, erm, Jonathan here"
Haven't really
local wood guides ?
Well Rob's got two
cos I'm just deciding on a new window frame.
And all the firms are claiming that they only get their hardwood from government  erm replanting programmes.
And one got a  stamp and a seal on that.
But whether that is acknowledged by our Friends of the Earth I don't know because I mean they have so many stamps and seals on
They won't give you names now will they?
The Friends of the Earth .
They won't give you names of companies any more.
"No but if this stamp, this acknowledgement."
Oh it's like a little  is it?
good government scheme or not.
Whether that is known  by Friends of the Earth as a good scheme or not.
I think  there's a day of action coming up on this sort of D I Y stuff.
so maybe we'll get some more information about that.
I'm gonna try and get the  book back from Rob.
Martin's an architect and  and it actually probably would be  you know it might be a good thing to actually sort of provoke a question with architects because they do specify these things and they're the ones who actually say  you know right we'll specify hardwood .
It's one of the decisions that are actually made by them in terms of what they use so  erm that could be something that is
Yeah
"round to architects just sort of provoking the question cos they, a lot of them have never thought about it"
Mm.
"and er  you know if they did erm I mean Martin asked about the, he asked about the good wood guide you know and I told them where they can get it but that they can have it in their office and put it in their library."
"You know so that, that's quite a good idea."
Yeah
"But that's so quickly out of date again you see the good wood  cos I mean they they have new government schemes, schemes every year don't they?"
Mm.
And new other schemes.
And
"What, at least it will enable you to know what the tropical species are because some of them have got quite weird and wonderful names and most people don't know what some of them are."
Mm.
I know mahogany is citello .
This year alone.
"So if you total it up,Be er again and first of all  council  being a, being a council, and they succeeded very well."
"And  at the Leith, South Leith very very well and they just er  district council."
"Was there a lot of that sort of feeling around, that sort of protestant action"
"No no this one man this one, one man in the whole of Edinburgh district council was  protestant tax."
"What er caused them to put that for the  er group forward I could not tell you, but that's what he stood for, this protestant action."
"He was neither Liberal, Labour, Conservative, none of them, he was just, he"
Mm.
What had been a er election representative until
"Er er an election agent,election agent when you're er a er d doing the work of an election agent, you've got to be responsible for all the data going out concerning the running of the election."
"Making sure that your candidate attends every meeting, for er s you know during er an election campaign they've got to attend all the meetings."
"Well the election agent was the man responsible for getting that data through to the, the candidate to say that you're speaking at a meeting, such and such a night, and another meeting at such and such  so keeping the, keeps that candidate on his toes, all the time, during an election campaign until election's over and then of course er you know what  transpires after that I su it's either"
Was you involved in the Labour Party for a long time before erm before you were the election agent?
No.
No no no no.
No n never.
"Of course I had this spell er er don't forget I was five years as a prisoner of war, and  a lot of interest because I was a union member pra b previous to that you see?"
Was this what erm led you to join the Labour Party?
Your initials at a trade union
"Yeah yes, that was er actually yes er"
Mhm.
I wanted to see how it o o operated politically.
I'd heard a lot about er af er I've been in the Transport and General Workers' Union as a shop steward and so forth like that.
That this was interesting me.
"I want to know, find out the workings of it, politically."
What did erm how did you find the Labour Party at that time compares with the Labour Party now?
Oh much better.
W er united.
"It's not united at the present day, there are far too many lefts and rights and centres."
"If there's e if there any  party's operating at all, there's only one p one thing and that's centre."
"No lefts, no rights, centre."
United.
Now let's move along the line.
"Erm any any questions on er  itself or you know if there's anything I haven't told you, I mean there's probably quite a lot, well there's a lot I know there is."
But yes anything you want to er erm please jump in.
"Er but if not let's move up erm to towards er towards , and this is erm this is the erm former under-bridge at , going up to Mill."
Now the roadway used to come under the railway.
"Little humpback, bridge here, erm and used I say used to go through to  er Mill itself just er quarter of a mile along the track."
"Erm the er the road was later just moved to the left hand side of that bridge, and er no longer having to have that restriction."
But that is still in place as you can see.
"Er a fairly light railway, erm but er but adequate."
That's taken from just re wh basically where the roadway is now.
And that's the trail looking towards .
"Now let's move up to the next port of call, which is  Station."
I should say it's convenient for neither I should imagine.
Erm single track shown on this ordnance survey map.
"Again about nineteen er I think nineteen fifteen, maybe a little bit earlier."
"Erm a passing loop there, for trains to be able to just pull in and let anything going the other way, because it was mainly single track from er from  onwards."
Erm and a little bay there for er goods traffic to go into the sort of station.
"Station platform, the bridge there, and the station master's house, there."
A little head shunt at the end to protect anything running back onto the er main line.
Erm slightly nearer picture.
Er and I think erm er a bit later date actually.
No it's probably about the same.
"That one's a bit later date, and you can see that they've double the track here."
"Erm just made it a er does it's not double track er very far, but they have actually double tracked that."
And this is erm in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties.
When there was a fair amount of er goods traffic particularly coal from .
That er that line I think went to just er a bit further up and erm er I say not an any matter of er another couple of hundred yards I think before there was only a single track.
Er that is the station master's house at  Station.
And er it's now the part of the  you can er go to a picnic area along here.
You know you can walk through there back to .
You can just see the remains of the platform there.
And er platform over here.
"M m yes, they talked about work  or work , and erm, but not about conditions particularly, and  was a medium pit for conditions."
"They talked about conditions at  which was a wet pit, and er how Hucknall was much better, anyhow and things like that."
But great talk about Union activities.
What were the Union activities?
"Er well, there was the highly immoral thing called overtime, erm if you had too much overtime you was keeping someone out of job."
Er you wanted a fair number of hours and you wanted a fair wage.
Er the Union was very  parochial .
Mm.
So the men in the house were all members of Nottingham Miners Association?
Yes.
What about the General Strike?
I suppose the strike would be an early
Well
memory for you?
Yeah.
"The General Strike,it's a strange memory  because I had to walk down  Pad er now, erm I forget what the proper word is now, er it's called  Walk, now ."
"sounds terr er terrible to me,because  Pad was the way to  Colliery, the last half mile along a dirt track."
"And er Granddad  was on maintenance, of course, and I used to have to take his meals, so I used to go past the er picket, along with many other people who were busy coal  out of the pit tip ."
"Er the picket was not as militant as it is now, and there were the talks of scabs, and things like that."
"But the Strike was, well we had the pit ponies up, and er we always used to go and feed them, and then we went, of course, to chapel for meals."
"I won't say soup kitchens because they weren't that at all, I mean, they weren't as civili You had a civilized meal, I know you sang grace before it, and said grace afterwards, but you had knifes, forks and spoons and chapel china."
Mm.
So how?
Do you remember how your grandfather and father felt about the Strike?
"Erm yes, they er, they felt they'd been let down by the Railway men, I think, or someone else at the beginning at the Strike, and they were out on a limb but er they'd got to make the best of it."
Mm.
Erm I think they thought they'd been let down at the end of it.
"Erm I was taken to h hear A J , the miners leader at the time, he was the best type perhaps, a Welsh Chapel Parson, erm on the recreation ground and on the marketplace, when thousands turned up,"
Mm.
attend .
"How how did people feel about , because well if you read read Alan Alan  book, then he's criticized very strongly as being too militant, and r well really Cri preferred to him."
How how did the the  miners?
"The seventy nine of you who voted for banning hunting,a are you all townees, do you not understand th the fabric of er, of the country?"
"Do you have an alternative to offer that would er, that would sustain that fabric?"
Yes?
"I live in the country, I live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm, and there's no co , no message at all from the farmer that  foxes are a pest  it's a misnomer put about by the hunt."
"Fox hunting was started, two hundred, three hundred years ago by the aristocracy because there wasn't enough deer, because the fo the forests were getting obliterated by the same pi , the same people, it was started as an entertainment, it's an entertainment now!"
"And now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing, they're saying it's pest control, they're saying, we do it, it's quick, it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck."
It's not!
"The hunt encourages foxes into their land  they actually build artificial earths, we saw one of Saturday when we were out protesting, the ar , they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them."
A hunt is no good without foxes.
They don't want foxes
Alright.
"to be depleted at any way, they encourage them!"
So you actually go out and do something about
Yes.
your your your er  your feelings?
Wha what do you do as a protester?
"We actually, I'm actually er, in the Scottish Action Against Blood Sports"
Aha.
"and we do many things, we write to MP's, we write to councils trying to get them banned off the land, and we've been very successful."
"We've actually helped stop the  oldest hunt in Scotland, in Li Lithgo in Stirlingshire, which ended last year."
We were very successful then and we've now  progressed.
"We go out every single Saturday, weekdays if we can, and we try and stop the  stop the fo , hounds killing the foxes"
So
peacefully.
"so so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in, in Scotland?"
Very!
Right.
I'd like to disagree with that.
Ah.
"I'm an ex-master's wife from Lithgo in Stirlingshire hunt, and we had to stop because erm  the country was disappearing underneath us."
We had a new
Mm.
"It's not, how I prosper financially."
"It's not, whether I'm in good health."
"It's not whether,a , whether I've all my little  itty-bitty prayers answered."
God's blessing to me  is life forever.
That's his blessing to you.
It's not making a list.
"It's not giving you  total health, and free you from all sickness and diseases."
It's not answering all your prayers.
It's not making your life easy.
It is giving you life forever!
That is the blessing!
That is his big parcel he's given to you.
It's wrapped up in a .
", thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!"
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Those disciples, they had the storm stilled for them  and it got  easier sailing."
It was plain sailing then to the other side.
"They were more comfortable, it was a, it was a more enjoyable journey, and let's be honest  if I can go through life without hassles and without problems my life will be more enjoyable, of course it and these difficulties, and these storms coming away, coming your way your life will be more enjoyable."
"But like the disciples, it will not be any better, or any safer."
Their safety did not depend on the storm being still.
Their security and safety depended on Jesus being with them.
That was it!
"Your safety, and your security and my safety and security in life  does not depend on how pleasant my ways are and how pleasant my paths are  how much I manage to amass, and how I can overcome all the little difficulties and problems and  steer clear of the big ones  the security and safety of my life, now and in eternity,security is there in the boat  and lying with him."
"See, the real peace  is not the stilling of the storm  the real peace is that the assurance of who is going to stop it."
That's the promise to your eternal life.
I will never leave you.
"You don't understand the circumstances, you don't understand the storm    I might , I might not  leave that to me he says  I will be with you."
I will never leave you.
I will never forsake you  even to the end of the .
Well let's see
Come in.
Yes
So I asked if they wanted anything and she said a bed at the cottage hospital
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds
Oh you mean a bed?
You mean a special kind of mattress?
Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
"She just said a bed, so I told her there were special beds that we are very useful in fact very necessary in  cases and we tend to be short of them"
Ah ha
and a  bed costs two thousand pounds.
There's another one  can't remember the name of which costs a lot more
Ah ha
Something like five thousand .
"Anyway, I said I'd make enquiries as to what was wanted and I said because there's a new children's ward will open at the  hospital and perhaps they would ."
So I saw Mrs  and Mrs  said they were aiming to raise money for scanner appeal
Yes
They're also going to have a obstetric  department  first time
A what?
Obstetric and patients
Yes
and that obviously they would be tend to be other children with mother's there so they would need perhaps a play facility there and other children who goes to the E N T clinic can go to the  not just go to the outpatients  casualty
Yes
There's very limited facilities for children to play with.
"So, but I also approached Mrs Earl about a ."
"Anyway, she wanted me to go and see her."
"She said there was the scanner appeal, the  talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and there's an arts appeal and for arts facilities in hospital and all sorts of things."
"So I went back to Miss White and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that would be the best idea, not the ."
"I also told here it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital and the children from  invited to the hospital that day, that week sorry, it's gonna be a week in June so she wanted to know the details so I asked Mrs  t would she write to Miss White and give her all the details but she thought it would be far better if she went to see her and explain it all."
"She was going on Wednesday, I hope she went."
"Hold on, which one was going to see which one?"
Mrs  was going to see Miss White
So potentially two nights out of the four.
Does it have an address Helen?
No it's through  erm
Right I just wondered if she gave you an address cos it you know got a super little town map here.
If I was being cynical I'd volunteer Mark's car to get people to and from the town.
If it was a long way out.
Well he said that was a possibility but I really  so.
But then again .
Erm but then it starts getting very very silly.
I mean this is basically she's she already books some flats and house a house because self-catering accommodation's in such short supply because of long lets over the winter.
Do we need to proceed on this now.
Do we need to see if we can draw up an extra .
I think one of the ideas behind the the party chipping in on this is because it would be extremely convenient for people who are popping in at the last minute for
Mm.
for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least kip on the floor.
Where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive B and B because all the cheap places have gone.
So to a certain extent the idea was to that if we had the thing worked out it would be of great benefit to the people who were popping by.
Erm whereas at this stage the four of us could probably find accommodation which wasn't that much more expensive erm but to have the actual focus for the for the local party .
Could we have  people to pay the six pound a night and erm you know  a hundred and forty four to start with and just ask people to pay the six pound a night anyway and just get as much back as we can?
Yeah yeah.
Cos six pound a night isn't bad.
It's less than we pay in Wolverhampton .
Oh it's very reasonable yes.
It would be possible I suppose with the commitment of people  for the local party to make  on the committee.
I mean I have a couple of ideas.
I was going to ask Mike  if he wants to come as an observer because he's never been to conference and erm
And when it comes
he was talking about spending a weekend with us anyway so it might be nice thing to do.
When it comes to that though there will be people from other green parties who who'll be looking for accommodation so at the last minute we can
Dick  for example.
Yeah.
We're hoping that we'll
yes
"yeah fine, okay great thanks."
Sarah.
I work  my main aim on this course is to gain confidence
right
I don't do many presentations mainly because I work in a small team
"right, right so it's about confidence Great thanks."
Bob
Senior  Midland area and I've been working on a job in  Coventry which is basically  work er what I hope to get mainly out of this course is an increased level of personal confidence so I can overcome basic nervousness when speaking.
"how to handle the nerves, I'll say right now and half of you may want to walk out of the room."
I don't have a magic wand I do not have a magic wand that you know take three deep breaths turn round twice and your nerves will disappear yep.
"So if that's what wanting   we've got problems straightaway erm but certainly we will discuss what to do about that yes and to recognise them and to understand why, yes, fine but I don't have a magic wand."
I'd I'd be a millionaire if I did wouldn't I?
Rob .
Senior Engineer for Midlands area I'm er presently on  seventeen million pound office development  the job's  completion  erm my presentations are basically from site labour to erm professional engineers and architects
yep
on a one to one basis or or to small meetings
Mm
What I hope to gain on the course is to be able to speak more confidently and to get over the nerves.
"right, great thanks."
Gordon
"Senior Engineer for Midlands region, currently been working on the  developments which is design built and  development gangs of which"
yep
erm I have er one to one dealing with subcontractors engineers the architects and site meetings not a great preparation but there is
more or less every day to day
right
erm I hope to get out of this more personal confidence and more  talk more clearly
So it's to be clear in what you're saying to be able to explain yourself clearly so it's about clarity
right
"The need to make it clear so that people understand without having to sort of keep coming back and asking again and again, yep, great, thanks."
John
I'm  I'm the senior  south west I currently work  schemes my main aim on the course is er to gain more confidence
Whilst there's a world economic malaise.
"Not sure you can blame the media altogether, I noticed you said there in almost these words er, John Major will the lead the Conservative party into the next election and the Conservatives will win."
You said exactly that I quote word for word in November nineteen ninety and a week later what happened?
You challenged Mrs Thatcher and brought her down.
Well it's interesting that er I mean these quotations get It must be very clever research.
Well you offered it.
"Yeah well okay, well I haven't I mean, I I did I did actually think that Mrs Thatcher would lead us into the election."
"Er I thought that it was wrong that she should, as everybody knows."
Er and I think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party.
That was my view and still my view and I think John Major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the pundits it has to be said.
er I hope I did everything I could to help.
As I did Mrs Thatcher.
Nobody worked harder in the nineteen eighty seven general election than I did.
Yeah but the point I'm making is that you thought that would happen then.
You say it may happen it is going to happen now.
Why should we believe it now any more than we believed it then .
"Well I I I mean there i thinking back, I didn't think at that stage, I hope I'm right about this,th that I had any idea that Geoffrey Howe was going to resign."
I never had the slightest intention of challenging Mrs Thatcher.
There was never my my view and and one day I shall if I ever get round to it I might set this all out.
My view was
Write your memoirs?
Yeah.
"In nineteen eighty six, my view was a very very clear one."
To survive.
I mean nobody thought I could do that.
I mean not many people who'd clashed with mrs thatcher did survive.
"But I did, that was my determination."
"John Major is beset with problems, you wouldn't"
Yeah.
argues that.
"In fact you said er again if if I may offer you one of your quotes erm, If you have back benchers who won't support you, that limits governments abilities to take decisions."
you said that a few months ago.
Well I mean I I know what Barbara feels about this.
"She feels that  erm  at the, the level that we are working at it is really coun be counter productive to hold stock."
Because however hard you try stock deteriorates.
Yeah.
Erm but I you know I feel that that very often we don't sell stock
Well couldn't we just have a few things
and I feel that if we did have stock then  then we would erm  sell it.
So I mean that that's two ways of looking at it.
Certainly if  we've got some stuff in a box
Well I mean we needn't buy the expensive things like sweatshirts
Shall I try at erm Cambridge?
I mean it's October.
"Yeah but they, will they, they won't sell you on at a discount will they?"
Cos if we all
"But I mean I I just know that that Harlow tried stock keeping and selling, they gave up."
I know that er in Hertford they were quite desperate.
All came up with the same idea and they wanted to do it.
And in the end they came to Barbara's conclusions  so that its a an expensive thing.
"But I mean if we only had like the  writing paper and the envelopes and re-use labels, small items of stationery"
the stickers and I mean
they still do  yeah.
"But I mean I I expect, I mean even we had some left over e eventually you could sell them to our own members because they'd all want to use it"
Mm.
and it's cheaper than ordering it off the catalogue.
That's a good idea about Cambridge isn't it?
"You could borrow there stock, is that what you're thinking and then take back what we didn't sell."
That's what
I mean I've never talked to them so I I don't know yet
"Well if they would let us borrow it, that's a different matter to buying it from then because we then wouldn't make any money on it."
"Well I don't, I have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this  selling."
Well you you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more.
But then you have then you have the stuff that doesn't sell and deteriorates and you still have to have paid for it so
over to you Mike
"Er, hello there, my name's Mike, well let's go over to the weather with Winsy, no Winsy, oh Rita's dropped dead, she's jumped off a cliff we think, we think"
and now we'll go over to Winsy.
"Hello my name's Winsy  insy spider climb up the spout, down came the rain and washed Winsy out, when the sun came out it dried up the rain, insy, winsy spider climbed up again  thank you, oh thank you, oh thank you, I know, thank you, well, today, at midday today it's going to be tipping down with rain and winsy, winsy, winsy, spider will fall down the rain,"
Melissa
"Er, oh, right, on toni , tonight we're gonna have sun and maybe a bit of snow and tomorrow morning we're gonna have a full moon"
oh you're
but he was quite
well
alright then
"Do you mind, I'm trying to do a programme here, and how the hell can I do it, with your gob slapping?"
Thank you
Oh you dickhead
"Oy, right then today, we have got Melanie of Neighbours here with us"
oh my god
"other day and I told this lady and she goes, who the hell are you?"
Who the hell are you?
"Well I said what you looking at you skinny thing, and she just, how dare you speak to me like that, and I just who the hell you looking at you ugly thing , I'm going to Espania tomorrow, cos I'm going holiday to El Spania,right then"
what you doing you sexy woman?
Thank you
"your wife is over there, don't you talked to her like that"
who the hell you think you are  I've got a good mind to put your beard right in this food
and he said
"came up to me  and he did, do you want a game of footy, I said oh"
"sorry about that love, well I'll go"
"and I tore this paper and I said if you're gonna have a wee wee then do it wee on me, so I said, up your"
all over the place and then I went out
"oh stink bomb, oh, come over here, who want a football, ah, want a game of footy, alright then"
er man in the goal man
oh look like that
"he's a football player as well, not him, not"
"are you doing, making it"
Ah well more or less much the same as it is today.
That's what we got the union for.
That's what we got the union for.
"That's what we got the union for, to make sure that these things did not happen."
Mhm.
That we wouldn't be stepped upon.
Were you involved in er any strikes or anything?
"Yes, I was involved in the nineteen twenty six strike."
And in nineteen twenty er strike  going at the present day there was what we called the soup kitchens.
And every local village where there was a mine had these soup kitchens.
I do not forget  the other unions which were going at that present time helped us out quite a bit.
Though we los we actually lost the strike through no fault of our own.
"There was just because there wasn't enough money within all unions, not forget that there wasn't such a thing as a T U C then, this was in at the infancy when the unions first started, there wasn't such as a T U C, Trades Unions Congress."
"These were er in, in its infancy then and er we had a soup kitchen and er we, we got soup once a day, when we got issued with it."
"Each family took over a, a ration card."
"And you got so many slices of bread, so many pots of soup."
"And this was all done in old wash houses, where they used to have the boilers."
Where we used to b boil the water.
"And the soup was made in these boilers, and they were issued with their soup then."
And that was all we got.
What was it erm started the strike in the first place?
Well they started the strike as muddled as  as some greens come up and the men as union thought that was not right.
"Not forgetting in that most of the mines then, at that particular time, were nearly all privately owned."
Mhm.
Were nearly all privately owned.
Were nearly all privately owned.
"Most, right across the length and breadth of Great Britain, were all privately owned."
"Which the present administration of central government are doing their best to, under the same hammer as  it was in those days, so  it's just, this is just a repeat performance of the those days and the government today."
Was what it erm finally brought about the end of the strike in twenty six?
Pardon?
What was it finally brought about the end of the strike in nineteen twenty six?
"Well it were just like I  like I  the unions weren't as, as er financially well off as they were er at the present day."
If not entirely mine.
So I I would like to ask the meeting whether erm  I suppose  technically for advice on this topic.
think we can get away with putting out another newsletter on the seventh of February with a ballot in it anyway for these two things even though we didn't
Yes.
I think so.
I I mean er I doubt whether we'll we'll have a full slate in February anyway so I mean they'll probably be the option for people to come in later and we'll probably end up co-opting people later and er I think we should
Yeah alright.
I'm pleased you think that because it gets me off the hook now.
I think that because I don't think people wait until the deadline to er respond anyway.
Helen?
Erm I think technically we're actually constitutional because it doesn't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline.
It just says that we have to make the the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot.
So  they can do it from they can work it out for  themselves actually .
briefing.
Ah so so it's alright.
"So everybody who got the newsletter when they read it should have thought, Aha best look up"
I'm sorry
my copy of the  constitution  that I filed away so neatly when I received that months ago.
I think perhaps an apology and erm and an  in er the next newsletter might be appropriate for.
Otherwise we'll  phoning us up and complaining .
You'll probably be ringing people up anyway trying to get them to understand.
Yes I agree entirely.
I don't think people are going to be disappointed if they miss out .
Great.
Otherwise I if it's appropriate I'll say it looks like a great newsletter.
Yeah.
Right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of February.
Which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means I'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry.
So I'm collecting things to go in it.
Er those things should include well something about the box erm next next day or whatever I can find .
Details of about where and when.
I've got a thing from Steve about erm planning permission or application for Sizewell C that I didn't have room for in this newsletter.
The prisoners of war were used as miners in the
Oh yes
camps?
yes.
Oh yes.
"We were used as miners, yes."
How did the pay and the conditions and such like in the army compare with erm being in the mines?
"Er the, the money, the money that I  money difference wasn't great but the fact was er who you were thinking about er when you did come out."
"You had a lot of, a lot of qualifications which you could get in the army in those days that you didn't have when you were in civil life."
"For instance you could learn to be a, a motor driver, you could learned to be an electrician, you could learn to be an engineer, you could learn to be anything."
"And you  through these courses and you got a certificate when you come out which er some of the  said to us, a fully qualified member of a, so these advantages were open to us then you see?"
Mm.
"So this was the, the main incentive for joining the army then?"
Pardon?
Was that the main incentive for joining the army?
Knowing that you gain qualifications?
Well my that was my  incentive  the mines.
Yeah.
"But as I've already told you  just, it was very ironical that I should l go back down the hole in er Germany again ."
"Were the conditions worse in the, in the German mines?"
In the ?
"Oh no, I  the mine, the mines in Germany at that time were far advanced of what er Britain's mines were."
"Cos they had different methods of doing the, digging the coal out, than they h than they had in Britain."
And I believe .
"Although I've not been down a mine since then, er the German mines to my er estimation were far more advanced than what the British mines were."
Were you made to work hard harder being a prisoner of war?
No harder than we did in Britain.
"You could not, no, a miner once he's been a miner, cannot go down er a pit and say to anyone down a pit, and say to anyone down a pit, that he's not a miner."
Because he gives his  right away.
"The experience he has gained in the mines at  immediately a man g a man who has been in the mines goes down there again his er n er he gives himself away, because, just because of the experiences."
"I saw an incidence er down in the, the mine a, a miner himself can tell, by the creak of a tree just where the heavy, heavy weight's coming on the, on the, the roof."
And where there's likely to be a fall.
The erm type thing means what means little codes mean or does that give us any indication as to what these sites are?
No there isn't a key unfortunately.
Oh.
I'll tell you now if the poster says Labour isn't working I'm not having it.
Yeah what which is the nearest one to a Conservative Club?
Cos there's a Conservative Club down in Fishergate isn't there
They actually own the one on the side of the Conservative building I thought.
Or they thought they did until it always says Conservative propaganda  on the sides so I think that's a gonna .
It's it's on a little table at the end which says rate card analysis and it had T V areas Yorkshire T V North East T V and then principle main secondary local corner shop other and totals   numbers in the middle .
Anybody got any suggestions on that ?
Will we pay the cost of the poster site?
Is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster?
I think so.
Well I think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site.
Whether or not the Green Party then supplies the posters I wouldn't like to say.
Right so it's not just that the National Party want the people on the ground to choose the nice addresses.
Well that's the
I think it's clear that the money's coming from from the local parties.
What they're ac what they're trying to do is coordinate enough local parties with the same poster that they can make a block booking I would have thought.
This might be a good way of raising funds by asking people particularly for the Euros I think.
"Why don't you sponsor you know, members who don't normally come to meetings, to sponsor erm a site for"
Yeah.
I think a lot of people would be willing to do that.
"Erm make a big splash in the newsletter, Please sponsor your your Green Party poster for the elections."
Doing this this is one erm campaign that  as a small proportion of the poster sites is it?
It looks that way yeah.
There must be lots of other .
I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the  they were working
Right.
Okay are you willing to go away and
Yeah I think I need to talk to Miriam again don't I.
Unfortunately I don't have a phone number I only have an address.
It's just a case of it's just a case of a few individuals or people with rank who think they've go so much power they're gonna press people
Yes I'm sorry to hear that people in rank in your particular case were involved
"Yeah well we've got a job to do if you're a soldier you've got a job to do okay, you've got a bit of training, you've got a job to do"
Right absolutely
"yeah you don't need no distractions, and bullying and bullying"
"I quite agree, I quite agree"
"and racism and all that,distractions"
I quite agree
and if you're gonna send people to Northern Ireland and places like that you want 'em to defend the next soldier?
Well c could I just come in?
But they do.
David Lightbown yes David Lightbown .
Andrew I'll let you back in.
"in a minute,in a minute."
"I I certainly didn't go in in in in with a rank on my shoulder, I went in as a recruit."
But you said
But when I when I when I trained as recruit I trained with a lot of other er lot of other people .
"But that was in different days, this is nineteen ni"
There was no easy way out in my day you w yo y
"One second Andrew, I'll come to you in a sec"
you were fetched in and you did your National Service.
Now when you did
this National Service you served your country for a set period of time.
I actually did three years of that that period of time in in in the Army.
"The majority of people that went through that service all had some recollection of things they didn't enjoy very much but they by and large thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the Army, it livened them up, it made them better men and we have got after all one of the best armies if not the best army in the world, it's got to come from"
I don't think that's
somewhere and it has to come from the training.
Alright Andrew briefly briefly.
Go on.
"Basically I don't disagree with you, aye we have got the best army and I loved my I loved my time in the Army but I'm totally against the way I was treated in the Army."
That doesn't there's  when you're off duty it's great but when you're on duty it's different.
the Army's made me a lot better person.
No Lochassynt Lodge.
That's right
Lochassynt
that's right.
And my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also.
Fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy?
Well
Or stories about the the people that were there or
Well
passers by?
ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp.
Aha.
The gentleman of the road.
My word and me just as a little boy of eight years.
I was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment.
And well did the gentry know that too.
You mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers.
Well yeah ministers er.
When I think of it nowadays and I see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well.
When you heard there was a minister coming I was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming.
And even that seemed a  but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way.
My word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road.
And there was no fright to be taken from him.
Is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ?
Oh yes.
Made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on.
She was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going.
And my word they enjoyed it well.
They wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even.
They would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock.
No they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father.
They would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came.
"What I also want you to do on this is if you can refer to Adrian Bull's book, the Economics of Travel and Tourism, and just go through the relevant chapter on demand."
"It's the Wensley Gate,Group."
"The tape recorder is now running, I hope that it's going to be recording, but let us not erm, be inhibited as a result of that."
"Erm, programmes, erm, haven't got a programme."
No.
"Erm, I haven't got a programme."
Thank you.
"You haven't got a programme, the very last one."
"Wh what, how how very carefully calculated that was."
"Erm, we are today, going to do the Black Sheep of the Family, erm, because erm, erm, doesn't feel that he he's up to doing the one that he thought he would do this week."
That will be postponed probably for a fortnight.
"Can I remind you, erm, looking at that programme, that, erm, healthy eating now appears on, I think it's the, sixteenth of March, and sadly I shall be here on the sixteenth of March."
"I shall be in Leicester at any rate, and I may very well come and join you, to talk with you about healthy eating."
"I was hoping to miss that one, because you might be trying to persuade me that I should erm, partake rather more of healthier food, than of the unhealthy food that I do eat."
"Er, it is."
"Yes, it is it is a project study, and therefore it would be as well, if we were all thinking about it in advance."
It it is in tha the hand-book.
"Er, it's on page a hundred and thirteen."
"And the idea is that as we've done with previous erm, discussions, if each one could come along armed with some information to do with healthy eating, erm, there's a list on page a hundred and seventeen, that might start you off thinking."
"Erm, celery, low fat dairy products, incidents of heart disease for those who have an olive oil rich diet."
"I don't olive oil, that's the trouble."
No.
Formic acid can be helpful to pregnant women.
Well that certainly doesn't apply to me.
No.
No.
Twenty two heaped teaspoons full of sugar every day.
"Well, considering I have none, somebody's having an awful lot."
"Er, and eating will be always one of, and so on, there's a few items there, that you might like to concentrate on, and perhaps, as much as anything, if you have your minds open in the intervening number of weeks."
"If you see an article, a snippet, er, a comment, from a newspaper, from a magazine."
"Cut it out and bring it along, and I think it will all add to our discussion of healthy eating."
"from you than the statement you've just made er and I think you'll be you used the word abhorrent, I think you'll be abhorred by some of the er stories you're about to hear."
"If I can come to you Andrew , you were in the Royal Highland Fl Fusiliers, what"
That's correct.
happened to you?
"Basically  the full time I was in basic training and when I went to the Regimental the Royal Highl Fusiliers Regiment the first battalion, I was physically beaten and mentally tortured er into the same bargain."
Well what do you mean by mentally tortured?
"Well they can physically do it to you with use of fists, use of hands and whatever else they've got and they can mentally do it to you like put you in jail that  or all sorts of things like when I was on sick leave, they came and lifted me."
"Right well t t tell me about the physical abuse, what sort of things were they doing to you Andrew."
Beat ya up.
"N C Os, noncommissioned officers beat ya up, and a above them as well."
You get
So
"in a battle camp, you're supposed to be  learning how to fight in a war and basically they beat ya up, and in camp as well, it happens in camp too."
"And did did you see th w was it widespread, did you see it happening to other people?"
It's very widespread.
Actually I  witnessed a guy being raped in the Army.
"That was by that was by normal recruits but it still happens it, actually the the bullying goes down the line."
"The N C Os bully, the officers bully the N C Os, the N C Os bully the privates and the privates bully the privates."
"It goes down the line, all the way down the line."
It's a nons it's a non
"If you're bullied, you bully somebody else"
Aye.
and so on and so on?
"let me just get back that was abhorrent as a word w has already been used and er should be used again by what you said, you saw s somebody being raped by two soldiers."
Did you try and help that particular soldier?
"I did, I did, I s actually put a stop to it."
That's
So that was a brave thing to do?
"I wouldn't say it was brave it was a normal thing to do, wasn't brave, there was nothing brave about that."
Was just a normal thing to do
You'd expect yeah y you'd expect somebody to do that for you of course.
Of course I would.
Mm.
W what about  Street school?
"Street School, I was th there on only there a year, and the headmaster came in one day, he was another Liberal politician."
"Headmasters were always members of the council, in those days, and they were always tended to be La Liberal or Labour, which I the present Labour would say was very pale pink."
"And the headmaster at er  Street school, Joseph , was a Labour member of council, and Joseph  was tended to be more Liberal."
"He came in one day and asked what M C C stood for, and I've always known a lot of useless information, so I could tell him, so I was then dispatched everyday to the erm radio shop in the High Street, to get the cricket scores in Australia."
"And then he asked me, he said, Well, have you read that notice on the board about er scholarships?"
"I said, Yes, but there's no hope."
"He says, Well, your aunt was a teacher,co you could go teaching."
You're na you're not going down the pit?
"I said No, no-one at home was, Everyone at home had said, You're not going down the pit."
"And he entered me for the scholarship,, and er, I won."
Mm.
"I incurred his displeasure on one occasion, there was a young lady sat on the form in front, we had those, where you sat in pairs, on the iron sort of things."
"She had plaits, and I tied them together, on to th behind the bar, and he he caned me.."
Mm.
"I suppose caning was a a more frequent form of discipline, in those days?"
"Caning was, er yes, erm."
"If you asked for trouble, you got it."
"Would you ev would you ever get any comeback from you your father, if you got told told off at school ?"
"If you got in trouble at school, you got in trouble at home."
No if and buts..
"About going t about getting the Henr scholarship to , had only just opened then ,"
That
hadn't it?
It hadn't er I went when it opened.
"We were er before then there was the , the school just over the wall to  Street, was the  Centre."
"It was a pupil, teacher centre."
"It started life as a technical school, which it was given by subscription, mainly the colliery company, for scientific education."
But used during the day by the Education Committee as a pupil-teacher centre.
"And up till then, you went to you got your scholarship, you went to the tu pupil- teacher training centre and then you became a teacher."
"Erm if you  passed  , erm you did a stint and then you came to  College, Nottingham for your teaching ticket."
I mean it depends on each organization doesn't it?
Sort of two way two way thing you agree or don't agree between yourselves.
I'm in some ways surprised the non-political groups want to affiliate with with the party.
War on Want are er for a long time have been the only probably the only erm  that put their neck on the block as far as social and environmental aspects of the party go.
But you know I agree with you cos that  as a charity.
Yeah they seem to have a lot more to loose than we do.
Yeah.
There's been a lot of trouble lately a lot of problems haven't they.
War on Want didn't they go bankrupt or something.
They did yeah.
There is a possibility that War on Want should  be considered as being relatively high on our list of people we would be willing to affiliate with.
That's something that  not bad at all they do  as well so.
So is this was the national War on Want who contact us or the local contact?
Erm it was a lady who came from Leek.
Oh.
Do we have any feedback from any other local parties or the National Party are they recommending it or they only putting out feelers to local parties and ask what what we feel about it?
No.
associated with for example you're  party.
Oh that's just a mailshot deal.
They quite likely the Green Party got a free mailshot and their communication returned or or even might have got some money from them you never know.
I thought this sort of thing would be something the Green Party nationally should decide that whether in principle we ought to affiliate with.
Yeah but the advice might not have gone amiss and
Yes  surprising that War on Want aren't asking the national party
Yeah.
and instead are mailshotting all the local parties.
I think it may be it may be that  they could perhaps get more money if the local parties affiliated separately but
What about our links formal or informal with other York  branches of other
Yeah I mean this is this is erm more the sort of thing that I I had in mind.
Yeah.
Erm I think I mean we ought to be doing more with the local Friends of the Earth and local Greenpeace I feel.
In the past Greenpeace have always rejected us and er on the grounds that in fact we're a political party.
And Friends of the Earth it's only relatively new it's only been going properly for what two years.
That's all from Region.
"Er, I've also received minutes from the Epping Forest from Redbridge Group and they also have a lobbying workshop erm, that's on the second of March, and they're asking if anybody's interested in that."
Is that an evening?
It doesn't actually say
I think it's
"but, er, probably would be."
If you're interested could follow it up.
"They meet in, don't they meet in Leytonstone or was it Wanstead, somewhere in that area."
Wanstead
"Mm, mm."
"was, was, where they help Islington."
Monday mm.
Would you be interested in it?
"Well I might this, this, the time fitting in with the families, they're, they're likely to come back to"
"Okay, well I'll, I put some information not full details ."
Right.
"Erm, actually there wasn't a lot of detailed stuff, there was erm, materials for gr groups and winter sales"
Do you want to pass that over to Aida please?
"which we have a  erm, there's a bit about release policy and procedures for local groups, er, groups can help their prisoner with mummy or other erm relief, erm on the Christmas family particularly and it's, it's explaining you know how they do it and the best ways to go about it."
"Mm, cos there's a special fund available for that, that's particularly why they"
"anyway they explain all about it, if it would, if we need it."
"Er, there's a mandate workshop."
"Oh they, no, sorry,, they're offering still a mandate workshop for the group, erm, sending a trainer"
I'm the trainer.
"you're the trainer, oh well ."
"I've been very bad on this recently, I've really been too busy or tired, but I have got, I have, today I have had arrived oh not today, the last few days, the new mandate workshop, so"
So you've got to read through it and let .
"I was gonna say, having spent some months or years  well ."
"It's all the new bits in about it, yes mind you, there's always, always been a mandate, the mandate workshop was the very first one that's produced, but this is an updated version and changes ."
"Yeah, have there always been workshops , continue workshops on mandate or?"
"Yes, there's always been a mandate workshop?"
Or just when there  reviews?
I think very often you do need professional help and it isn't possible to do it with family and friends because of the interaction that actually makes it worse.
"So there's a practical suggestion and I, I like, I like Carole's philosophical suggestion that we could start celebrating the diversity of human kind."
"I mean, that's the kind of thing one often hears on this programme, is it wishful thinking or d'you think we could actually achieve it?"
Oh!
Wahey!
Yes?
I think the media have an awful lot to answer for!
Yeah.
"I run one of the self-help groups that one of the ladies mentioned and we looked at an outsize catalogue recently and it went up to size twenty six and in some cases up to a size thirty  and the ladies who modelled the clothes were no bigger than a twelve, possibly a fourteen, but a very shapely fourteen!"
Mm.
Mm.
"So the media, even when anything you do depends on your size,yo your image is all for a woman, your brain or your ability really comes way down the line!"
You have to look good first  before anyone listens to your other abilities!
But looking big and good are not incompatible are they?
"I was just gonna say, I I think we should possibly stop blaming the media or whatever actually happens and perhaps echo what the  the lady earlier said, I think that it's in our hands, we're the women   that could make this happen !"
Yes?
Well I
I was just si Oh sorry!
I'm sorry!
One at a time!!
I was just sitting here wondering why men don't have this image problem?
Because there are an awful lot of overweight men and I don't see any problem with them at all!
They don't seem to have any problems between each other either!
I'm quite concerned that my four year old daughter is after a Sindy doll  and wondering whether perhaps Sindy dolls shouldn't be produced  in erm  such diverse figures as real life?
Well there's an
"Are we, are we providing"
an interesting idea!
our future generation with women with an ideological  figure such as Sindy.
A lot of ideas and certainly worth talking about it.
It's something I hope we'll talk about again.
I hope you've learnt something and I know that I have!
Thanks very much for joining us.
Yeah.
That's the difference.
"And between them both, you can, you could  I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand  back."
Yeah.
"Well, finance company."
"You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed."
No.
You don't pay no more.
"Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures."
"You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out"
Benji
very high
He's alright.
"It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know,"
Yeah.
"five thousand pound, not."
Not paying it for years and years all the time.
"But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back."
"Forty grand, you kn that's the only difference, and"
"I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way."
"But I just got one thing that I want, that they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a bit nervous, you know."
"No, they won't send a loan shark."
"You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent ."
"Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em."
"But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so many,yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gonna pay it back."
You know.
"If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years."
"Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ain't ya."
"So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off."
"We're still having trouble getting insurance, and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who he's with."
"'Cos he had a right job,got plastic, 'cos he even  plastics, I mean that's"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I might do"
your handwriting's quite nice and neat
"Erm, oh I've got another piece back that I've  twenty nine, twenty nine  as it goes"
That's a C innit?
"Yeah, but that goes, that goes in the lit file, so I got rid of my er with the thirty five I managed to get rid of erm"
Who's got all these things?
They're at school in a box
Thank goodness for that
"but er, so now I've got a thirty six, thirty five, thirty four, thirty four, thirty four, thirty two and thirty, so that's a B count in B file, so there's no hassle with that, but if I can get on and get rid of the er, I've got twenty eight, twenty nine in there as well, er twenty eight in there as well, so I want to get rid of the twenty eight and twenty nine  but it is a guarantee that a B file, so there's"
Mm
"no real worry about it, but erm I want to do better"
What about your economics?
Or don't you know that yet?
"Yeah, he still keeps far faffing around with the erm  whatever detail, yeah, he still hasn't given it to us"
Well how you supposed to do it?
"Did you get, did you get that thing finished er geography whatever it was?"
"Something, something"
Science
well well whatever it was you
No
had to finish off?
No
Why not?
"Because I didn't have time, but er they started geography course work today and I was out the lesson"
Why were you out the lesson?
"The drama thing, so I'm a se a section hand already on that and I've even got a, well we're supposed to listen to it tomorrow, we've got a tutor period instead, so it means that we miss another lesson"
"Can't you copy out what you, what you missed?"
"Yeah, I'm out tomorrow night, I'm out school, selling books again  so should be at home"
When you gonna get all this work done Richard?
"Yes I'm trying to get it done, but I am getting pressure from the year group as well, it was, and so I've got that, back out at Wednesday, so I'm gonna have to have my hair done last"
Gonna Wednesday what?
"Erm, got a rehearsal haven't I?"
"As I say, I would like you to be in  fairly close proximity to where I am so that you can see what I'm doing and hear what I'm saying."
Er and I don't want you to be too close.
I will actually be working to start with in this area here.
So perhaps you could arrange yourselves in a semi-circle just round here.
"Right, my friends  we've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm    I do beg your pardon  when we are printing."
The one which you will have come across when we were doing lino printing was turps.
"We had to use turps didn't we, to dissolve the printing inks?"
"Can you remember that, when you did lino printing?"
Mm
But when we're doing screen printing we use very much stronger solvents  which can have a nasty effect on your skin.
You notice I have slight eczema on the palms of my hands.
"Some of us have even worse eczema, yeah?"
So it's really important that we  don't irritate our skin.
But frankly  it's not likely to irritate your skin anyway because er  you aren't industrial users of this  you would only ever touch these chemicals for a very short time so the  any possible side effects they might er have on you will be  greatly diminished by the fact that you didn't use them very much.
"If you're using them in industry, day in day out all day long, then that is the real importance of wearing protective gear."
But I'm just going to demonstrate to you just  what happens.
This lovely supple rubber here  is exactly the same supple rubber here at one time but now it's gone all hard and denatured because of the chemicals.
"So if y if the chemicals will do that over a long period of time  to rubber, think what it would do to your skin."
Does that make sense?
Mm.
These lumps have become so erm hardened by these chemicals that I can't er pick up  the  thin zinc plate from the  tub.
"I'm afraid that Mrs  has gone off with, ah Mrs   I'll be very grateful if you could bring me in a bowl."
You know the one you just took out?
You want it back?
I wonder if I could have it back please?
A a bowl.
"A a bowl, it doesn't matter which one."
"Just a plastic bowl please, washing up bowl."
Do you want anything in it?
Or just water?
Er  bring it empty and I'll .
Thank you very much.
and everything went .
"When I reached the pit bottom, there was approximately three feet of water at the pit bottom and I had my first experience of water in the mines."
Were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days?
"Well in those days er there wasn't much me much er coal cutting machine, this was all hewn by hand."
"And we had the pit ponies and where we didn't have the pit ponies drawing the hutches, which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom, then er we had to do it by hand."
And if there were h a wagon or a hutch went off the road there you were with not enough height to lift it all back off the rail again and believe me that was experience in itself.
So it was quite a difficult job then?
"It was a difficult job, yes."
Mm.
What were the erm the wages and the hours like?
"Ooh, the wages."
"I started the wages and er I didn't have much more, I started I had six and eight pence per shift."
Mm.
And er what were the hours like?
"The hours, well sometimes I would do a double shift which was sixteen hours."
"Or eight hours for a full shift, sixteen hours for a double shift."
Mm.
"And in those days we required the money and er often, very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit."
Do a double shift.
"Which meant you come home from your double er shift, went to your bed, had about four hours sleep and were back out for your normal shift again."
Was you erm in a union or anything at all at this time?
"Yes, the miners' union then was just  wasn't that that  was started was ."
"In fact there's, very near the start of the unions in and o er that, that the miners' union was one of the first to start up."
Do you think it gave you erm any advantages being in a union?
"Y oh yes it gave us advantage to the extent that we'd someone b behind us to fight for any, any er grievances that we had."
That was the idea of the union starting out in the first place.
Mhm.
We had to pay into a union.
"We can, on every Friday there was a union official down there in a small hut."
"We had straight from our wages straight to the union, it's payed at union right away."
So that there was nobody skipped.
What were the erm the erm relations between the w the workers and the bosses like?
You  I was in a warehouse at  served thirteen year there.
"And I was working in a large warehouse, a three floor warehouse, a grocers,grocers."
"I served there for thirteen year, became a chargehand eventually and eventually the f the firm folded up."
What were they
"Very old established firm, it was established in er eighteen fifty six."
"So it was a, a, a firm of about a hundred years standing at that time."
But the both brothers who owned it er Charles er John and Tom  were becoming very very aged and were not capable of carrying on the job.
And they approached the son who wasn't interested so they just folded up.
What were the conditions like where you worked in the warehouse?
"Ah well we, we actually made our own condition and this is one time, I'm telling you again, where my union membership came in very handy."
I actually made it a  union firm .
So you unionized the whole firm then?
Organ organized it.
Organized the people inside it.
And I explained to them  what benefits they were getting.
Mm.
Although the employer was pretty reasonable to us he p always payed us sixpence above the rate.
Above the normal rate.
What was the erm the employer's attitude to you unionizing and organizing and
"Oh oh he didn't say, he says oh just a, it'll not worry me he says, whether you er start one or not he says."
"I pay my men sixpence over the, the rate."
"So I says well thank you very much, but still for mu l people benefit themselves."
Mm.
"They're better being in a union, he says I agree with you, quite agree with you."
"The union fights for  he says, and the union's a  but I'm one of these employers who paying them, my men a plus rate, so I'm paying men sixpence plus over the normal rate so there was no difficulty there."
Mhm.
So he obviously wouldn't have thought the union would have been much of a threat to him seeing as he
"No, no it didn't  because he was prepared to pay over er above the rate ."
The union already fought for that rate and they got it.
But he was paying them sixpence above the rate so there was no problem to him.
Did you notice much differences in the work once you got promoted to a chargehand?
"Well er there was  I didn't do so much of the normal grafting naturally, but I was always, if there was a new man came on the job they would always  learns."
Yes.
so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few
Mhm.
years has has  is an experiment.
How do you feel about that?
"I, don't mind being used as a guinea pig because I feel that it'll help people in the future."
Up there.
I believe that we have been given the right to have dominion over animals.
"The point I would like to put over is, I've listened to one or two erm, radio programmes, and television programmes about this and I personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals."
I don't think us  er er  public people really realize what is going on and I think then they would maybe stand up and be
Mm.
"and be counted, but I think we've tended to stand back and just say  well we know it's going on but what is actually being  done to these"
Mhm.
animals?
Yes?
"Yes, we  that lady over said there were guidelines, there were people that go in and inspect, but there are not enough, it is a known fact, that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal  erm, experimentations are taking place  and, I love animals, and alright, yes,yo you can do ex , some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel!"
"That lady up there said that we have experiments, I'm sure, human  experiments , you know, experiments, sorry, on human people"
Mm.
"but, on human beings, but we're not put through the state that animals are!"
We
Mm.
"don't have great lumps made to grown on us, we don't go through she , severe pain."
"And, which company was it that says, to  do something about pain  you first have to create it."
Mm.
"Ah, I mean that's terrible!"
"I was responsible for researching into the, so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty, and it was a real can of worms!"
I was
Yep!
I was sorry I got involved in it at one point!
Erm  cosmetic companies are very devious!
It's what they don't tell you that's important.
"Erm, there is a big problem at the moment with cosmetic labelling, for example, erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean?"
"We'll start down at the far end of what we call the lured mark and from there you'll have to tack all the way up to this closest one, the windward mark."
"From there it's a reach out to the far end to the wind mark, drive there and back to the beginning again."
Great.
We'll try it a few times just to put it all into practice.
Okay let's go.
That's fine .
Okay.
"Okay Howard, this should be a good test to see how much she's learnt."
Over she goes.
No she's let out the mainsheet to spill wind and now she's under control again.
"It's quite a steady tack around the windward mark, now that she's reaching she should have raised the daggerboard a little."
Now ready for the gybe.
"No I don't think she's ready quite yet, she's got a few things to sort out first and that's definitely not right, she wants to raise the daggerboard not lower it, bit of confusion there about which way to turn the tiller but she's round safely, she should be looking where she's going now instead of sorting out all the string."
"Okay now she's off really quickly on a reach but she's oversheeted, she's got too much power there, she's sheeting the sail in instead of easing it out until it flaps and then just pulling it in a little."
Should Suzanne have let the sail out like that?
"No, by letting the sheet go she lost power."
After the tack she'll have to put it all in again to accelerate away.
Now sitting out to balance the wind
That tack looked Okay.
"Yes, but she doesn't need that bundle of mainsheet in her hand."
"For this part of the course she should have the daggerboard right down,and she could be sailing in slightly shallower tacks towards us."
Whoops.
What happened there?
Well she let the boat heel so far before sheeting out that the boom hit the water and wouldn't go any further.
She recovered by leaning out more.
Suzanne's got a good sense of balance which is always useful when you're sailing  Now let's look at this gybe to see if it's any smoother.
Oh yes that's much better
"Wow, she's really taking off now."
"Yes, the wind is stronger out there."
"Considering she's only been sailing for a couple of days, she's doing very well."
If she were more nervous we'd have reached the Topper.
"She's still a little unsure on those tacks, she's easing out the mainsheet as she goes round."
Whatever they were carrying.
They they generally came all year round?
Yes oh yes generally came.
Ah but they always watched th they would be in some place over bad storms you know.
Er er er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days.
So he would still stay there because he was told about the weather.
And he would know himself.
Mm.
You see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather.
He they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it.
Did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather?
Oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come.
And when they would offer to no no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in in their bags they would have another clean or or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing .
Mm.
Or whatever.
Well they would be discarded.
It's it's like I I better not say say this but Irishmen over that when when I when I used to work with Irishmen my word they was good Irishmen.
Very good friends of mine.
But they would work they would never see them with dungarees.
They came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double breasted and then and they would  work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all rigged out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then.
Yes I could say that that's true about Irishmen.
Mm.
The the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or?
Oh oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er er if you would look a a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp  there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes.
Mm.
Below the certain bridges.
Mm.
Depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be.
But never two of them meet together.
We we you never know that.
They would be always er passing.
They didn't go round like that they were very loners as you would say.
"coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it?"
yeah
"mm  there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet."
Oh yes the
Erm
the very big lady
"er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled"
Gosh
Sounds drastic doesn't it?
does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it
"Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er"
But I still like
"either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight"
I still like to know how they staple it.
"Yeah  yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er"
It must be an operation or
"Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it?"
"Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples  must be"
"Mm she was, what, what are you doing?"
Stop it
sounds a bit drastic
"Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation  presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to  stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a"
On the concept yep
"more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the"
but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat
That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise
"you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there?"
Yes it's er
"I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales"
Oh yes
Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer?
No
"Yes, but they never do!"
"You might say that about the human animal really, mightn't you?"
Yes
Thank you all very much for a civilized and interesting discussion.
Thank you for joining us.
Goodbye.
"What time do you get there   what, what time did you get there?"
.
.
"No,."
You said this morning  didn't ya?
"Travelling, between Woking and Guildford, or whatever."
"Er, and that, you, you'll  at the town cooking dinner, watching television, talking to my friend, or just roughly what you're doing at that time that conversation took place, okay,at work,form, then make me a cup of tea, she was photo-copying,"
Mm.
"that's what she was, she was doing  ."
There's an awful lot involved though.
", you're usually saying oh it's just, just general ."
Mm.
"Went shopping or whatever, as I say, it, it, it, a couple of days or whatever you feel, if you, if you, if you want to get into it you might find you want to do them all"
Mm.
"but if you, in two days, that"
yeah
"would be grate, okay, and the same thing for next page, this is the day I started which, like maybe tomorrow or next day or when ever you start it Wednesday, I started at ten o'clock in the morning, was I, I was in Woking, what was I doing  nothing just reading a, do whatever you have to put in your whatever you  ,"
yeah
"where you went for a walk, down, went to the shops"
mm.
"or whatever, just let them know roughly what you're doing, cos, all they get is a tape, it gives them an idea of what sort of things were happening at that time, any words they can't pick up  if she's cooking, maybe that's something she was making or whatever, erm, in the  please write the first names and details, why you know them, of all the people speaking on this side of the tape, in order in which they speak on the tape in the first, first instance, right, you know, so now Carla, my husband, myself, Lee and, you don't need to repeat them again after that"
Mm.
"so if you don't, don't want, not worried too much about this, I mean, although we want you to do this, I mean, rather just get the conversation, in, even though you don't do this ."
You want more than that .
The knob on the cooker's been turned.
Thanks for your patience.
That was very kind of you Sir James erm .
"Particular example, remember this is all confidential I I'm told so er er it won't go any further than this  room."
got anything
all the time
"So do you think it's something to do with maturity perhaps a child, a child is this wha what do you mean by forgiving?"
"You can forgive or punish at the same time can't you, you can punish somebody and say that is wrong and yet you forgive them, that is you don't hold it against them  but you  later on."
they may get they get sort of get a bad name and perhaps not
No.
No.
"You also have to think of the effect it has on other people, how er if you just let people get away with it, it doesn't mean you hate them, loathe them and damn them  but er you've got to make them realise that  for other people, for everybody."
What do you think er Graham.
what the parents  you know .
one-to-one
Yes .
Martina?
really.
"How then, how then?"
"Christians are supposed to forgive, but what if say it's the mother of somebody who had a child that's been murdered or if somebody has been raped you cannot say that they should forgive you cos they were a Christian."
"There's a lot of talk about forgiving or forgetting isn't there, some people say I can forgive but I can never forget."
Er you might think about some of these parents who have children murdered in the  how much do you think revenge comes into it?
is it?
"It's not that they're in rehabilitation, it's just like seeing  that person is locked away in the prime of their lives  revenge ."
Is this revenge or is this just the stopping other people from suffering really?
Shut up
Anyway
"they ask about school say, but I don't think schools have the authority really to do anything either way about er forgiveness."
"It's like if you fall out with a teacher on the first day of term, if that teacher"
You haven't that chapter for the rest of the year  and say the teacher probably thinks well this child  and
I think forgiveness is  not always
An ideal
forgive thine enemy always remember
No.
No.
"So if somewhere later on in the book she says, Michael Heseltine was a rotten old so and so."
erm
"I'm sure we know that she thinks that, so that won't actually sort of provoke great reaction in me."
What would it need to provoke you then?
We'll just see.
"What about, what she has had to say about John Major?"
"Well look, let's stand back."
My interest is in the unity and success of the Conservative party.
I don't want to see I I deeply deplore the divisions between left and right and the accentuation of often very phoney distinctions and mislabelling that goes on.
It's a development that has grown in my political lifetime over erm I suppose twenty years now.
"And I  don't like  that aspect of politics, the divisiveness of it all, the personal sort of er attentions of it all."
"I know it's there, but I thought that John struck with me a very powerful note, when he said in his conference speech, I should share these things first in private."
"And I don't think it would do any good for me on this programme, or any of my colleagues, and of course the media will be now all over the place trying to achieve this."
"To get instant reactions, instant comments which will blow the thing up."
But you're clearly unhappy about it.
I you you you've made that quite clear .
"I I cannot I I cannot believe that it is w within the the standards of the conservative party that I joined, that this sort of diary writing, gossipy, pseudo history er is part of the convention."
I think er one of the papers made this erm I think Alec Douglas Hulme er has set a sort of standard which I would admire.
"Er there were always memoirs, but I think that the nature of them has changed."
And I and not sure it's Well I am sure that it's for the worse.
It's causing damage?
I don't think that the people come out of it well.
Any of them?
Including the authors?
Er I think particularly the authors.
Should there be er a change in the rules?
What rules?
"That says, Well there aren't any rules at the moment obviously but but should there there are rules for for for civil servants, should there be rules for politicians?"
Well there are rules but cur
That say
Really?
"Lovely shops and everything, and er, it's all like round corners and everything, really, and some of these, dad's sort of, he marked the most that's open on Sundays."
"There, there's one street, it just like Gaps and everything, like, you know, it's a really lovely road, you know, and erm, it's just a really lovely area altogether."
"He showed me some really nice places, and then we went to this park, I can't remember what the park's called."
"We stopped off there, had hot chocolate and a piece of spinach quiche, but I was, and erm, and he treated me, which was quite amazing, and then erm,"
That was nice.
"and then erm, we drove, er then we walked through this park, which was lovely, it had squirrels running all round the place and pigeons and everything, it was gorgeous, and, and because it, it'd been such a gorgeous day, it's just that my fucking nose is cold."
It's really bright.
"So in fact, the sun is really hot, when you're in the car."
Yeah.
"So I, I erm, I had a lovely walk through there, and then we went out the other side of it, and it's Highgate Cemetery."
Oh.
"And, this cemetery is like, this, erm, George Eliot's buried there, Karl Marx is buried there,"
Mm.
there's all these famous people that are buried there.
"And er we didn't actually go in, but I'd love to go back one day and have a look,"
Yeah.
"because like, there there's a picture of the gravestone of Karl Marx outside and it looks really amazing, and some of the places, some of these graves that have, some of the, like tributes, are just enormous."
Really?
"They're just so big, it's incredible."
"You just can't envisage, you know, why and how they managed to afford such extravagant graves, and it's like on two sides of a road, on one side you can only go in, and if you're on a guided tour, erm, otherwise you've got to, be like, somebody to do with the grave."
Really?
"You know er personally attached to the grave, or go on a guided tour, and er, like you've got to wear certain bits of clothing, you gotta be like, you gotta be properly dressed, er, you're not allowed to eat or drink in there, there's all these things, like, you know, really"
into that.
Yeah?
But it looks fantastic.
"It looks, you know, I mean, it's  to say that, it sounds really weird, but it"
Yeah.
"so mysterious and strange in there, that it would be really interesting"
been in there.
to have a look.
"He's looked round some parts of it, yeah."
"We wouldn't have, we"
levels the then
wouldn't have no M S threes.
then none of our M S threes
would have come back at M S three.
"What concerns me is the project engineers are in close liaison with the client, and have a lot of procedures to go through that er S T Os and M S ones at design engineering level do not have to go through."
They do have a much greater responsibility.
"And particularly I mean just signing the V Os, because if it's cocked up, the question's been asked of me."
You know.
"If you have an S T O, in a sense if you don't define what the project engineer is, what grade he is, he can sign off unlimited amounts of money."
.
It doesn't seem right does it?
"I it seems, well"
No.
"But the point t that Hughie makes is that y you allocate er y you, you make the project engineer someone who have trained, and, and that you know is capable of doing that job."
Yeah.
Well I can think of one M S one in our er office who I'd be quite erm quite happy with him doing all the project eng engineering duties except finance.
"Because he, he just has  you know   a very slap happy er attitude towards finance, but from an engineering point of view you can trust him"
Mm.
so this means you daren't give him anything now.
Well in that case I wouldn't put him on er on a job that was made out on site but I would keep him in the
"T as far as the allocation of, of erm the project engineering responsibilities, that forms part of the quality plan."
"That, that, that he is given a note as part of the quality plan saying, here you are son, you are now project engineer."
These are your duties.
You are responsible for that job and you are identified on the project quality plan check list as to what you will be doing and what other members of the team will be doing.
"He couldn't live, live by it."
You know it d the first thought  bloody hell.
If you don't want to use it don't use it.

There's an anom anomaly here.
But if you don't want to use it don't

Fighting has cut off supplies to the refugees.
Save The Children works with organisations like the Red Cross to restore that life line.
Poor children in Jamaica often fall prey to drugs dealers who offer them clothes and shoes in return for carrying drugs.
"Save The Children helps youngsters living and working on the streets, it runs schools where the poorest can get hot meals and lessons."
Just one more example of how Save the Children does just that all round the world.
Yes.
"Those are some of the reasons why I and many others support Save The Children and thank you Patricia Routledge  for talking to us today, it was a pleasure listening to you."
Hello everyone.
Once again it is lovely to see you all.
"Well this is it, next year is our seventy fifth birthday so today is one of our most important meetings we will ever have."
"It'll be a very challenging year for volunteers, I'm sure you'll all agree."
In the past year I've been invited by many of you to meet branch members and to make shop visits all over the United Kingdom.
It's been a privilege to have done this  and I'm overwhelmed by the enthusiasm I've encountered.
"You, Save The Children Fund volunteers, are determined not to let the recession beat you."
The message I've given to London is that volunteers are in very good heart and it doesn't stop there.
The really good thing is that there are a huge variety of plans for our big year.
More of that later.
But what about the last twelve months.
What stories do our figures tell us?
"Well  while we were all delighted about the tremendous increase in income two years ago we were also a little concerned about how we should hold on to it, but we have."
"Last year branch income was on target at seven point eight million pounds, a massive increase on the plateau of five to five and half million pounds we were on before Skip Lunch."
Congratulations to you all.
"And the shops, well there are now one hundred and fifty nine shops."
"Together they have raised five point seven million pounds last year, a wonderful result and thank you all."
I particularly want to highlight the shop cash donations.
We've introduced a new donations box and some shops have special donations secretaries  and many helpers encourage donations too.
What a success story.
"Shop cash donations have gone up from five hundred and sixty three thousand to six hundred and twenty nine thousand, a marvellous increase."
Hello sir.
How you doing?
Not so good.
"Right, that's it, the boat's ready."
So let's go afloat to look at how the basic boat controls work.
Okay Suzanne before you go for your first sail there are a few things you need to learn about basic boat controls.
"The most important control is you, the helms are always set facing the sail."
Yeah.
"And so if you sit just a little bit further forward, that's fine."
Now you steer a boat with a tiller here at the back and you always hold that in the hand nearest it.
Then if we hold this rope in the other hand and effectively that's our accelerator.
That's what pulls in the sail and makes you faster.
Now today because it's a little windy we've rolled up some of the sail out of the way to make it easier for you
Yeah.
and so you could pull it in just until it stops flapping and then you'd be able to sail away and we'd never see you again.
"So before I let you go, I think you ought to learn how to turn the boat around, we call that tacking."
"It's quite a complex manoeuvre and so we'll break it down into the different parts that changing hands, turning the boat around and changing sides."
"Now we'll get the changing hand out of the way first because it's easier that way and so what we do is to bring the rope hand towards the tiller hand and then you can tuck it under your thumb, pick up the tiller with the other hand now, that's fine."
Now we initiate the turn by pushing the tiller away and the next thing to do is wait.
This takes quite a long time and slowly the boat turns around.
"When the boom comes over the top of the boat then you can change sides, sit on the new side, straighten up the tiller and you're sailing away again."
"Oh, that sounds better"
Well we'll try that once more and then we'll let you go.
Okay.
"So the first thing we do is to change hands, that's good, push, wait  change sides, straighten up the tiller, look where you're going  that's fine."
Great.
You're ready to go for your first sail.
Oh.
"Now it's only going to be a short one, just out towards that buoy and when I call you, you can turn round, okay?"
Okay.
Okay come back to me now.
Alright let everything go  fine you've become a sailor.
Now all we've got to do is teach you how to sail.
This is our stable starting position crawl on the .
"The wind is blowing directly across the boat, it's known as the basic  two position."
"Now  do you think that the campaign th the th , the campaigns against the use in cosmetic testing had anything to do with the changes that were brought in, or do you think advances and responsible er  science would have, would have made those changes anyway?"
"I think inevitably,th the changes would have come because the, the alternatives are better."
Yep.
They are less misleading.
"Ah, but I think the campaign, the public campaign and the pressure that's been put on companies have definitely made quite a, quite a difference."
Yes?
While I agree that there is absolutely no justification for testing for cosmetic purposes at all!
Absolutely
Yes.
none!
I think we would have advanced to the stage we are at had we not used animals in the earlier stages for medical research.
"We're advancing all the time and I think there may came a time we won't use animals at all for medical research, but at, up till now we needed to use animals for medical research."
"I think you've got to be realistic about this whole issue, that  er, obviously seeing the poor furry little bunny suffering for cosmetics!"
Mhm.
Yes!
"I agree, that is wrong!"
"But, if a test on a chimpanzee would save my child's life I'm afraid I'd go for the test on the chimpanzee."
Okay.
Yes?
"Erm I  I think that one of the erm, drawbacks in using animals for any kind of testing is that it sort of precludes in some way using alternatives."
"And I think that, you know people who, they may be trained when they're a studying to"
Mhm.
"use animals, and then go onto to work using animals, and erm  you know, if maybe alternative techniques were introduced at an earlier stage, maybe in their training, they'd be more likely to them on board."
"But, it's almost like it's  the established pattern to use animals to test"
Mhm.
"all sorts of things, and it's gonna take quite a big shifty to get out of that."
Mhm.
Yes?
I agree with what that lady's just said.
"What I find horrible is that  there are so many organisations or  or places all over Great Britain, they're all doing the same sort of tests!"
Can't we  collate our knowledge so that not so many tests are having to be done on all these animals?
Yes?
"erm, sort of relative."
"Yeah, that, that needs something if you actually set up a system and then a business meeting one month and a speaker the next, it puts a lot of pressure on one of us or some of us to, to , erm, this is true."
"Maybe, maybe, maybe if, I think it sounds as if people would, would like that, you know, at least every few months perhaps to have something different"
Yes.
"maybe, maybe, people could just be thinking or, you know if they hear of somebody who might be able to come and give a talk like your friend who, who was very good, erm, you know, we could make a note of it and, or ask people, you know, could talk to talk or something that sort."
"Mm, mm, that sounds a possibility, I think, I think it is interesting to have someone like that you know"
Mm.
"Like we had you know, who could talk about experiences you know, in a, in a particular country where there are human rights and problems, good."
"Right erm, so that's it, is that all the"
.
business?
"Yes, just, just, remind people the next, the next meeting erm, is Tuesday the tenth of March, we always meet on a Tuesday evening and it will be at Ann's house in Harlow, which is , said on the tape ."
Must be of benefit.
.
"Right, er, people can take what bits from tables they want them, or, I've got s , I've got one  put out, erm, shall we open that door a bit, it's getting a bit hot in here, erm, don't know if Mary wants any help out there."
Good.
"Testing, testing."
"Okay right, so what we've been looking at this week is trade in agricultural commodities, and er, possibly a little bit of GATT as well."
"And I believe Bob  has asked you to er, I think, collect some data erm, on trade in wheat and cotton erm, as an example."
We'll come on to that a bit later on.
"But can you just give me, sort of, a brief overview of what's happened to the composition of world trade right, say over the last hundred years or so."
What have been the main features?
"Well the er, proportion agricultural trade has decreased."
"Right, correct, okay, erm what absolute, the absolute values of trade."
"So the relative share of agricultural trade has declined, the relative share of manufacturing trade has increased."
How about in absolute terms?
It's increased.
"Yes, that's right."
All trade has increased.
"Why, why has trade in all commodities, agricultural or non-agricultural increased?"
Better transport links.
That are not the standard English shall we say something like that.
So let's think of all first of all then about the voice.
Now there's a word I'm going to use right now which is a technical term in a way and that is is er the technical term for the study of language and how we speak the word what we say and how we say it.
It goes under the lovely title of paralinguistics
Para yeah that's right yeah.
Paralinguistics is is the study of the words we say and how we say them.
So quite obviously the how we say things is all to do with the voice isn't it?
Now I've got four letter Ps to do with the voice er and what I want to do is is think about the comparison of aspects of the voice when we have a normal one to one conversation and compare that with the same aspects when we're making a presentation standing in front of a group.
First of all power.
The power of the voice.
How do we need to adjust the power when we're making a presentation?
To the size of the audience
"To the size absolutely, to the size of the audience so if we say a one to one we've got a certain level of conversational power if you say so with a group like this it has to be"
Just raised slightly doesn't it yes and obviously if you've got fifty people and you don't have a microphone or anything then it becomes even more so.
You get much above about fifty people you perhaps do need a some technical assistance with the power.
So the power needs to be just slightly slightly raised okay.
"Now another P, anybody think of other Ps to do with the voice."
Pitch
"Pitch, that's that's yes."
Now pitch is to do with er technically to do with the frequency isn't it the the high or low pitch like on a piano from high notes to low notes?
What do we need to ensure in terms of pitch when we're speaking to a group of people?
Variety
Sorry
Variety
Variety that's right there has to be variety because because if you talk in a monotone all the time then it all becomes rather boring doesn't it?
So there's got to be variations in the pitch.
"Power, pitch, there's one I want to squeeze in between but I mean it doesn't matter."
Pace
"pace, pace, yeah."
In a way projection is sort of with power.
Pace that's right you've been cheating and looking on looking on the next page
That's right.
I know I
That's right
the first time I get up well you see I cheat I have it lightly pencilled in
Well that's
You can do that
that's  because that's
you want to start suddenly you find yourself either
I have I tell you I've done that before now and then that one ends up right down in the bottom corner
and it's it's
It just it just takes the edge off it so it is a good tip actually it's just if you've time beforehand is just even as you were saying producing a thought pattern like this even just doing the first level just in pencil.
I've actually seen erm er been in a workshop as a participant where a chap who was excellent at this had what he did was while while the participants were doing some sort of an exercise he was actually making these tiny notes up in the top corner for himself so that when he when he came to the next sort of section that he wanted he'd he'd got he'd got the odd notes just up there in the corner.
So again that's something you can do but yes good tips thank you Jeff
just doing it in pencil lightly in pencil beforehand
Rolf Harris does that
Yeah he does doesn't he yeah that's right
"I don't do it on that, I do it on a big blackboard"
"that's right, that's right yeah there is that but"
well the way I do it is I I try and avoid the lecture lecturer
"yes,"
because I assume the audience knows as much about control and sub contractors as I do
right
but the idea is to to get their ideas  so that you can tell somebody else how you do it on your side then you can tell somebody else
yeah
"the need, I need to change  information"
yeah
it brings out some interesting ideas
I bet it does
and I  the flipchart
yeah
and that's that's the only way  it's amazing we ever get any sort of
right let me just then talk very briefly about this fella.
Now we're fortunate with with this that if I turn it on it's very quiet but if any of you had and I'm sure Jeff you've probably seen it where you get some older machines and the fan in there rattles like mad and there's nothing worse than having that thing rattling all all the day.
"Okay well  we're in a really bad situation, I mean we can achieve something at least and perhaps  oh perhaps communism doesn't work after all, they just seem to be doubting their own beliefs and what they've read."
"And that's the only way I can see a way through this, thinking okay they've got this ideology, they've tried it twice and it still hasn't worked."
Let's go back to the drawing board and try something else.
"Cos this, this is definitely not communism in any sense."
Right.
"I mean  does, does this document surprise you?"
I mean is
Yes.
is that what you thought the nineteen forty nine revolution was all about?
"I'm not surprised it's come back erm  to, to a sort of right  is this an expression of mass mind do you think?"
What do you think?
Cos if it is  communist behaviour
"There is, no there's no mass  argument because you've got"
Why not?
this different situation
that's not mass minded.
"Well it's quite, I'm sure that I'm sure, I'm sure that a lot of, I'm sure the rich peasant"
Well there's about eight people
cos really they're the only f you know they'll be going yeah that's my mass line alright
"Well of course it is, yeah  but that's not  thing is it?"
"Well, it is for them you see,"
"there, there's no such thing as an absolute mass line, the mass line in particular  two types of people."
No that's not a mass mind then is it?
Exactly.
well there's no such thing as a mass line then is there?
"but anyway we, we, we'd better stop there."
"But I think it's important we've, we've now got  what  what the policy was."
On the face of it it looks very much as though this is erm   very little social justice
"what, what I hope we'll do next week is to, is to take that idea up and to see maybe why this policy came through  erm and we'll look at the, like the arithmetic of that as to, as to how much money there was, how much land there was in fact."
Mm.
How you could actually achieve a distribution.
"So I think for next week  I'd like to be looking in some detail, there are two sources on this one is, is  and the other is ,tho those two are crucial in terms of understanding or, and   and that those are crucial in terms of understanding erm why this  policy document ."
"One way around that might be then to have enough cadres on the ground in order to, to do it properly."
"I mean even, in a sense you, you, you're worried about the excesses."
Yeah.
But also the administration of  and trying to rectify the
Right.
Right.
"S so the, the more  you've got, the less that is"
"Yeah the, the less but I still think there's a fundamental problem with drawing the distinction"
Right.
Right.
Fine.
"Erm but maybe this, this  issue is, is, could be important in the sense that you, you've got  tt er  if you take China as a whole you've probably got well in excess of a million villages  erm you've probably got a denser population in the south than the north so you've got more than half a million villages in the south"
"okay, and if you're going to conduct land reform  you've got to have an effective land reform team to go into each of those villages."
"Erm so you, you, and you, you're looking of, of land reform teams of four, five members  so you're, you're looking at somewhere between two and three million cadres to go into the villages."
"And you've got two or three million cadres, trained cadres who know what they're doing, are experienced, who knows what the south is"
who know what the south is like.
"So that there, there may be a, an important personnel problem th th that you realize that well okay  the option of going for land reform is, is there but you're saying  er it's likely  trouble  my experience of the past is that, that  radical land reform is, is disruptive  it could affect production, it could get out of hand, it could alienate people  in order to control them we need a lot cadres on the ground and we haven't got them."
Well even if you
"did have them would it, would it"
definitely be for the better?
"I mean they were, they were still so corruptible."
"Or had that changed  were they, were they mo more educated now and less corruptible?"
Who?
The cadres.
The cadres.
Because to some extent erm
Yeah.
"the rightist and leftist deviations were, were because of them."
Yes.
"Er so you would  you would need a very heavy rectification programme to sh to ensure, not just that you had enough cadres, but that the cadres were going in with, with the right attitudes."
"Erm  it, that would take time, I mean it's,th that would be very difficult to control."
Yeah.
"But er nevertheless you felt that you wanted to go into Well you were probably to over qualified for going into the pit, weren't you?"
"Never thought about the pit, I'd been There was no question about that, it was something that was not going to last."
"I mean, the pits would be worked out, according to the talk at home, and anyhow, we wanted to live in Dartmouth."
Mm.
So what did you actually do in the rating office?
"Well, I wrote out births, deaths, marriage certificates, and er then measured up houses on the rating side, erm worked them out for evaluations."
"Erm used to go down to weddings, at the register office on a Saturday morning, and hope that they'd turn up without witnesses, because then you had to be  compensated,, for giving your service."
How much would you get for?
"I occasionally got ten shillings, which was more than a week's as much a week's wages."
"Erm but er I learnt to write a fair hand, erm without too many flourishes, which er because I was always told that somebody might be looking at this in a hundred years time, or more."
Mm.
"In going to measure houses, did you have to actually go out and visit houses ?"
"Yes, oh aye I Yes, we You had to measure, and in those days, the councils were grouped in what they called Assessment Committee Areas, and each were wor making sure the other areas were using the same sort of basis."
"And I remember, one afternoon, going out with the whole of the  rating committee, to houses at Eastwood and Beeston, and other places, and m in effect measuring them by counting how many nine inch bricks they were across the front and back, to make sure that, you know, nobody was subsidizing anybody else."
Mm.
"Erm and you went in houses, you saw them."
"You know, learnt about construction."
Mm.
Did you see much of people's living conditions?
"Particularly poor living conditions,?"
"Oh you saw er you'd seen this because er you had friends all over, I mean, the fact that you went to  didn't er tt get rid of all your friends."
Mm.
"Erm you had friends everywh , in all sorts of places, you didn't dally, shall we say, in some of them that might have been a bit smelly."
Mm.
"And others that you wouldn't have gone in anyhow, but they were areas."
"But generally  I saw more living conditions later on, er when er I started rent collecting for the council."
Mm.
"And the rating officer was part time with the council, and one day, a rent collector was taken ill, and then I was given a five shilling bag of copper and told to go and collect these"
When?
When was this?
Er it would be nineteen thirty seven.
Mm.
"If they are selling it abroad, it's international though."
"Mm, ah yes, you can't, any domestic policy has international ramifications, if it affects er, resource allocation and, and demand and agricultural protectionism, like any protectionism will, will er, will reallocate resources, not according to comparative advantage, but according to some erm, some priority, we want to support our agriculture, therefore we'll erm, give agricultural producers a lot of money."
"Now, clearly that's going to dis distort trade because, if we're increasing domestic production   Come in, ah, hi Mervin."
"Sorry, you alright for tomorrow?"
"Yes, I can go to the lecture, but I'm teaching at eleven like yourself."
"I'll er, I'll see you if Win's free at, at eleven."
"Yes, yes, I've been to se I've a couple of people up to sort of promise a hand"
"Yes, is, is, is Tony, is Tony er, busy as well?"
Tony's got a le meeting at ten thirty.
"Ah, which won't finish"
"Fortunately I wasn't expecting to be lecturing, but er,"
Right
I've had to lecture for Paul
"right, well we'll sort, we'll sort something out, but I'll see if Winnie's, I'll see if Winnie's available."
"Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that, yes, yes, okay."
"I mean if the worst comes to the worst, we'll sort of, cancel a lecture, or something"
"Ah, well, it's only a matter of giving them a cup of coffee afterwards."
"Right, okay, I'm sure we can go, we can look after, we can get Robert  in or something"
"Yes, that's right we just get, just grab a couple of people."
Sorry to disrupt your class.
"That's okay, I'll, I'll sort it out anyway, later this afternoon, yes, yes that's right, yes that's it"
"Okay, ten o'clock, eight thirty nine."
Do you want me to introduce us?
"Yes, if, if you want to, just to let the students know"
"Sure, yes"
"who he is, and why he's there."
"That's, that's grand, thanks, Melvin, cheers."
"yes, yes, okay, thanks for everything."
"Erm, right, where was I?"
"Yes, so domestic policies, you know, can not be viewed at in isolation, right."
"All domestic policies will have international implications okay, and it's something that er, governments tend to erm, sort of over overlook when they're arguing the agriculturalists case in, in GATT."
"Then don't you think given that case, we should set up a whole inter international thing, which oversees all the governments?"
The constituency that chose you was the Conservative party.
That that chose you.
But you represent every individual in that constituency .
The the the  no no no no You were chosen by the Conservative party.
You then stand for election.
The reason why you're elected is because a sufficient number of people wanted a Conservative government.
"Now it's perfectly true, they understand I hope rightly, within the framework and philosophy of the Conservative party, that you have to respect the integrity of the individual."
"But it doesn't mean to say that you are sending somebody who says he's a Conservative, going to support a Conservative government, and the moment he gets there is to be found all over the place."
"Yeah but if you feel strongly about a particular issue, erm Elizabeth Peacock, during the er coal pits erm dispute when she was very very upset at what your You were planning to do, closing down all those coal mines and and she went public about it."
She she it was for her a matter of conscience.
And she was representing the interests of her constituency.
"You're not saying she shouldn't have been allowed to do that, she should have gone to John"
No I'm
"Major quietly or to you quietly in some back room and said, Look I'm a bit bothered about this ."
No.
I've made it clear I I personally like virtually all colleagues at some stage voted against my party.
I and that will always be a right and proper thing for a member of parliament to do.
"But it has to be done with great care, infrequently It is if you like, a nuclear deterrent in that sense."
And I don't quarrel with Elizabeth Peacock who I like and admire and get on very well with.
And actually have been to support on many occasions in her constituency.
Erm but but I I'm not think of of Elizabeth as a matter of fact.
"And there are some colleagues who are today, much more lax with their loyalties."
And
"And I mean you yourself, you know, during the Westland you you you left a cabinet meeting, apparently Mrs Thatcher thought you were going to the loo and you went on television to say, I'm resigning because I think she's got it wrong over Westland."
She didn't think I was going to the loo.
Well so we were told.
I dare say that's what you were told.
It's
not what she thought.
"Did you say to her, I'm going out to re I'm going out  and I may be gone for a long time."
I if I remember correctly those are words that led to the death of a very distinguished explorer.
I had no intention of dying the political death.
I'm a  I totally disagree
You had a you you you were unfortunate in the way you were treated
with you in the way it is run when you  when I took my allegations to him because that's basically what they're saying it is  I know it's no allegations
"Let's not go into the specifics of the court case just now  David Lightbown, what I want to say to you, do you think it's a case, some people might perhaps unjustifiably but they still would say that those people who are bullied are bullied because they are nonconformists and in the military one has to conform and many people"
Well of course of course they do.
It's what our the Army's all about.
"So if in any way you're different, if you're black or if you're short or if in any way you're different, you're fair game for the bullies perhaps?"
"It's not whether you're black or white, it's not whether you're pink or green, it's how you respond to orders."
And how quickly you respond to orders  situations .
Did you not respond to orders Richard Richard?
It's not a case of black and white did you say?
No.
"It is, it was a case it was a case with me that I was black or white and that's why that's why it hit the press like it did."
"look, look you're you're you're a guy that's been through a lot."
I accept that.
"Yeah, yeah."
But you survived it.
"And you will go on surviving it, you will turn"
"why should I have to survive it?my country too you know,"
I know it's your country too.
And nobody  no no nobody nobody is saying that you were tr
"I was told when I was in my regiment I was told  my country, it wasn't my country that was what I was told."
nobody is saying that
David Lightbown
"you were treated correctly,badly treated ."
"David Lightbown, David Lightbown ."
survivor
David Lightbown one second.
"Now er w w with every respect, to say that he survived it is something of a crass statement, because I remember reading about him thinking isn't this country getting good that we can have a black guardsman, and I remember my own disappointment when I read that he had to leave the regiment."
Let's speak to er Tim er .
"Now Tim er, you were a soldier now you're a social worker."
"We heard earlier on about this this this regimental bath I think they call it, this bath of excreta and urine and bleach and the brigadier and David Lightbown said how rare this was, er did you ever see it?"
I mean you said two years later  change.
"Ah well sure but then the whole lot goes, but, but, but, but, but this was, this was the document, I mean the way this was put forward, this is going to last us through into the foreseeable future."
"Erm  you know,th th th this er er it was a medium term horizon on this at the time."
Are you saying that they didn't mean what they said then?
"And that  I mean cos Mao said that how that you needed to have a moderate policy, that was the correct one"
Absolutely.
"in order to ha to achieve one's goals, are you saying that how look well you've just got to assume that they were wrong  that they didn't mean what they said?"
I mean it's perfectly
Yeah.
legitimate to think that how that they did think that this was a short-term goal in order to achieve their long-term  objectives.
"One, one might argue that  erm one might argue that there is a cynical implication thereupon, one might argue that  but, but in i i in exactly the same way at the moment you might argue that all the assurances they've given on Hong Kong are, are not worth the paper they're written on and, and, and as soon as the, soon as you get through to nineteen ninety seven they'll walk in."
"Er  are, are you saying no that they, they are not  er"
But you see they wouldn't have been able to realize their goals in nineteen forty nine.
"I mean, okay"
Why not?
supposing if they had
"fifty they could, they could have gone  they could have gone"
But could they?
Were th were the peasants ready for it?
Is that what the peasants wanted at that time?
Ah.
Well okay bu but in that sense are you saying that the learning experience was such that the peasant was so conservative and reactionary and so  was all you could do?
Yeah which peasants are you talking about?
Mm.
"Are you talking, saying the peasant, I mean it doesn't mean anything does it, the peasant?"
Mm.
all peasants.
I mean it may just depend upon how secure the
"How, how would you have felt as a poor peasant"
"I mean it really does depend upon how secure they were and how much, how much support,ge genuine support they had of the, the masses as a whole, because if they didn't then there's no way, and people weren't calling for them to establish socialism at that time were they?"
Would they have known what socialism was?
Exactly.
"le pool de javelle horse dirt, mm"
I don't know if we're supposed to be talking er French
We weren't
Ah at last home
"So that's basically, I now got a B grade for and that gives"
Mm
"so that's English, and I've gotta get, er he reckons he'll get a B grade for the er lit, but I was so cheesed off with that erm  piece I got today, thirty five and thirty five, one mark off being er an A, he put at the bottom aargh, if only you'd seen the lousy ending, cos he said if I'd got the, an extra couple of sentences it er would of been forty eight, forty, so that's, so annoying, but I've now gotta write an informal letter, I don't know how that comes under informal letter"
"You write to an imaginary friend, you're inviting him down for the summer holidays and you say all that, all about the sort of things that you're planning to do with them, make it up"
Can you put bad spellings in those as it's informal?
"No you cannot, you'll write it like a normal, a formal letter, like you would write to Melanie"
That's not formal
It's informal
it's that use of formal
No an informal letter
You said write like a formal letter
"Well you do, but you don't put, don't put like heading for a business thing and"
Oh
just the normal address and date and dear wh whatever it is
Er
"and then you write, just write a set paragraph just as you would normally."
"see if I can get a grade A for this one, that, if I can get a grade A for the er next two pieces that I'm doing, which I've got to hand in, that could take me to a B grade after that."
"Did you erm, give in a formal letter?"
"No he said don't give them in yet, but do the informal first, so I'll do the informal, we've got to do an informal"
"Well don't talk about it, go and do it"
Yeah I'll do it later
Well do it now you're not doing anything before dinner
Dinner's now
No dinner's in at least twenty minutes at least if you rough
Twenty minutes
"Probably, if you just rough out"
"Yes it's easy enough those  so, I hope they don't get bitchy because most of mine are on, on the computer"
"well then write the song through, write the informal letter by hand"
"I mean yeah as you say he's very high personable person, there must be some reason behind it  er and a lot of the theoretical reasons that he says of"
"of ideological progression, maybe he thought that, that, that erm the only, ultimately the only way to capitalis er to communism was through capitalism and he needs to establish a period of capitalism first."
Sure yes.
And that's what sort of Marx said.
So that
Yeah.
yeah but it doesn't mean that they're selling out completely does it because it
Mm.
"it means that it's just, it's a realization of, of the progression of communism  is to establish a capitalist phase."
Okay.
"communism rather a, a weak theory doesn't it?"
It's like saying
"Well Mao would do anything  the Communist Party, let's make it capitalist society."
"No because if you look at Marxist writing it's,i it's, you go through certain stages and you can't achieve"
That's right.
And that's what's happening to us now
"That's just, that's just  but why does it have to happen?"
It doesn't.
If they really wanted they could've just gone straight for it.
If they'd really wanted to.
They wanted to make it work though and they couldn't have made it work unless  they had had the  I mean the right conditions to do so.
You could have you could have made it work.
"You could've made it work if the peasants if the peasants were revolutionary, if the peasants had  changed their value system and weren't  and that  there were very few who were still working within the  economy."
So er
Are are you saying this is all that was possible because the peasant really was a capitalist at heart?
Well it was very likely that this policy was gonna succeed
In what?
"and they was gonna take a bigger risk, in keeping  them in power   so that they can achieve  their longer term ends."
"But sh sh sure they can succ succ they can succeed in creating capitalism, it, it  it, it might succeed in  paving the way for new China's industrialization  but we've gone a long way from any  any ideological position, we've gone a long way from  well what is in the best material benefiting class of the poor peasant now  the poor peasant is not gonna get very much out of this."
"It seems as if a disillusionment, the communists are trying you know, trying policies"
Yeah.
and they're still not bloody work what can we do?
Since
Yeah.
"then he's lost er you've lost another seat so his majority is even smaller, it's down from nineteen to seventeen."
So his er abilities to take decision are even er take decisions are even more limited now than they were then aren't they.
He is in greater trouble now than he was the for all sorts of reasons .
Well no that doesn't follow.
No no.
Er What I said then was true.
But it doesn't follow that he's in greater trouble now because
Smaller majority.
Er no.
It isn't a small majority in any serious sense of majority .
Smaller majority.
It is only small because a very limited number of Conservatives on the back benches are not totally reliable on too many occasions.
"And it tends to be I'm sad to have to say it, it tends to be a limited number of colleagues who are totally I think, removed from the mainstream of what the majority off us want to see, who are to prepared to withhold their voted in the House of Commons."
And I think that there's going to come a point.
"D I think John er put this question fairly to conference, If the Tories want to behave like the Labour party did, then we'll pay an electoral price for it."
I I'm not against I can't be against the right of a c of a member of parliament to withhold their vote from their government.
I have done it on about three occasions in a third of a century.
And I wouldn't change that vote and I respect people who are prepared to do it.
It requires guts and integrity.
I'm not against that.
But for the sort of College Green psychology and the and the
"For people who don't understand, College Green is the bit of greenery outside Westminster where people rush out to be interviewed on camera ."
"The dash The the the sort of headline dash out of the House of Commons, the moment the news breaks, to get on television with some quick quote."
"And then to withhold one's vote as with almost a matter of habit and routine, that cannot be in the best interests of the Conservative party."
"And you have to realize, none of us are there cos we've got happy smiling faces."
"We're there because the Conservative party chose us, and put us there."
Yeah but
And so we have obligations to them.
"But you're not there you're not in parliament to represent the Conservative party, you're in parliament to represent your constituents."
I I think you've got to just look at that constitutional concept.
It's not dangerous but she loses power.
At least she's got the daggerboard down there.
I see she's sailing more efficiently to windward.
Well it looks as if Suzanne is beginning to relax and enjoy it more now.
"She certainly is, after only a couple of circuits her confidence is growing."
"She's acting more naturally to the gusts, leaning out and then easing out the sheet."
It's all becoming a more natural process.
Well how was that?
It felt absolutely .
You did very very well.
Oh thank you very much.
Capsize.
This is the part of sailing which every beginner dreads.
"The boat's on its side in the water and you're nowhere to be seen but in fact it's all quite straightforward, neither the boat nor you can sink and it's simply a question of pulling the boat back upright again and carrying on sailing."
A deliberate capsize is part of every beginner's course.
Once you've tried it you'll lose all its fear for you.
"This is the easiest way of turning the boat over, to tack without moving."
"Swim clear of all the ropes, swim around to the back of the boat, pull the daggerboard down and then simply flip the boat upright again."
"With the Topper, you'll find that there's very little water in the cockpit and so you can start sailing almost immediately."
With a little more confidence you barely need to get your feet wet.
If the boat capsizes because it's overpowered  simply scramble into the high side until you end up standing on the daggerboard.
"Then lever the hull upright again and clamber back in, it's as simple as that."
The worst thing that can happen is for the boat to become totally inverted and here you need to slide the daggerboard quickly out before it drops through the hull.
Now the accent is on patience.
Just think of the resistance to the sail dragging through the water.
"You have to pull very slowly and carefully, try to jerk it and you'll bend or possibly break something."
"Once the rink breaks through the surface everything happens far more quickly, you scramble in and you're ready to sail again."
If things go drastically wrong and you're a long way from home and need to call for help the most effective way is with an orange smoke flare.
"If you see one of these from the shore, phone the coastguard."
Even if you're upright you might need to call for assistance.
Perhaps you're exhausted where you've had a gear problem.
While you're waiting roll the sail up round the mast.
So what do you hope to get out of sightseeing?
Increase your knowledge.
"Right, increase your knowledge."
See different cultures.
"Right, see different cultures."
Anything else?
Take photographs.
Sorry?
Okay.
"Look at nature, get back to nature."
Certainly that's the appeal of Central Parcs.
Anything else?
"See how it feels, the way that they live there."
Okay well that would again tie perhaps more in with culture.
"I mean you can, you're starting to get, if you like, a big list now of motivating factors."
"Er for example all of us in this room, if we went to one destination, we'd probably all come away with a different combination of things that we'd actually got from it."
"It might be education, it might be knowledge, interest can be another one  er relaxation, romance, having a good time  there are a whole se sequence of different reasons."
"There are other reasons as well, things like peace and tranquillity  er time to reflect  er and yeah there are other motivations as well which you, if you like, are kind of negative."
"For example the desire to escape your humdrum existence  back here, er the desire to escape the family, er to have someone moaning at you continually, these are all important factors which add on."
So in effect there are kind of like negative motivating factors which is basically all to do about escape  where you don't care where you go as long as you get away from here.
And then there are the things you get when you actually go to a destination.
"So  again if we look at all of these things across the top  we've got other things influencing across here  when you go on holiday you, each of you in this room, you'll probably have some idea beforehand of what you want to get out of that holiday."
"For example if you go on an overland trip trekking in erm South America, you're clearly looking for something totally different than the person who goes on the sort of typical Club Eighteen to Thirty type holiday."
"Other things which will influence, it's claimed, are things like social class  er again used ex er extensively by marketing people in this country."
"Now you'll be doing this before Christmas, and what it is is there, there are lots of different categories we can use but the standard one is dividing the population into six distinct categories."
"By and large it's according to people's occupations and you start with A which will be professional people, surgeons  solicitors etcetera."
You have B which are managers.
C one which would be office workers.
C two  skilled workers.
"D unskilled workers and E, that would be everybody else."
Okay?
And as students you're in E.
Mm.
It's not such a pragmatic thing then because
"one of things you said earlier on you said when you  do become very radical erm it's, the distinctions between  become blurred"
Mm.
that erm one of the most important things is to keep up your production
Right.
"and therefore if you're gonna er introduce this radical land reform straight away, I mean say  there is no landlord but there's a  peasant, or  I mean unless the Party's ac completely active"
Mm.
and they're gonna get hit.
Right.
And basically what they need to do is create  peasant  economy to increase production as they learn from the land.
Ah right.
"So if you go too radical you're gonna hit production, and you're gonna step back which"
"Right, and are you beginning to say that production is coming to be a more important criteria now?"
Yeah I think so.
Well it certainly has  but there's still kind of elements of
I think especially when they find out that there's not much land to go round as they ash assumed.
"assume that if you give them  a population that owned seventy eight percent of the land and find out  fifty percent of the land , then you, you know, you can't just give land, everyone's not just gonna have land, you have to increase production to make everyone better off."
Mm.
Right.
"So whereas in the north the, in a sense the, the main criteria was mobilization  as you're moving south in the new situation a new criteria is, is production."
"you need, you need, you need mobilization you need"
Yeah.
"support, but then even more you need production."
Yeah.
Right.
"There's also another problem with land reform in  I can't really see how they could implement land reform without reverting to similar sorts of  they used in  which is  defining class distinctions and the chaos that that causes and the problems it causes erm  it is almost as if , if you go back to erm settling of accounts"
Mm.
okay you're erm  you're getting rid of your communist ideas  you're  finding a smoother way to getting erm  to achieving a similar sorts of effects
"hit the top end  get a  cross-section o of, but you still get the same, ultimately the same sorts of results erm by, by erm by adopting that policy whereas if you go  for trying to draw distinctions, you end up erm"
"Right so it's, yes, so, so, so the danger is, is chaos and the movement gets out of hand and"
Right.
"I mean at one stage we go back a hundred years — back to Dalton  he thought of his atoms as being fundamental entities that could never be broken up, whereas now we know that an atom is a very complicated structure and we can measure things about atoms, we can measure the  distribution, we can where the electrons and so on are."
Nuclei — there's been a tremendous amount of work done on nuclei.
We know the shapes of nuclei.
"We know there are round ones, there are long thin ones, there are cigar shaped ones, there are disc shaped ones."
"They turned out not to be elementary at all, they are complex things."
"Neutrons and protons are now believed not to be elementary, that inside them they have quarks."
"Even now there are theories which say that quarks are made up of other things and so on, so I mean who knows."
I think simply it's unknown.
"Jim, I'd love to keep going here and ask you a whole lot more questions."
Unfortunately that's all the time we have today.
Next week there'll be another programme in our series Ideas in Action.
"Until next week then, goodbye."
Hello.
"In this short series we're looking at the boundaries of science, and we're asking questions such as‘How cold can we get?’ and ‘What is the smallest particle that we can envisage?’."
"Today, by contrast, we're going to the other extreme."
We're going to peer into space and try to imagine the huge distances involved.
"Our guide is Robert Smith, who's an astronomer at the university."
"Robert, let's start by trying to put ourselves into context."
We're on a planet.
"Yes, and this planet is moving round the sun, which is part of the solar system."
"The solar system contains not only our own planet, but also many other planets, at varying distances from the sun."
And the whole size of the solar system is something like forty astronomical units.
"We're going to have to talk about what astronomical units are in a moment, but let's go on in terms of size."
"We're part of this particular system, what comes next?"
"The sun is just a star, one of many thousands of millions of stars in our own galaxy, which is the milky way, which we see as we look up in the sky on a very dark night, and it was called the milky way by the ancients because it looked like a splash of milk across the sky, but we now know that it's a flattened system consisting of these thousands of millions of stars."
"So we're actually part of the milky way system, the galaxy?"
Yes.
Which is the milky way?
Yes.
Are there many other galaxies in the universe?
Oh yes.
There are thousands of galaxies.
Again trying to get more of this lifestyle into their day to day existence.
Comparative prices are gonna be a motivating factor.
"Competition, the price of alternatives etcetera  and then you only have to look in any travel agent's window to see that that's an important factor today."
"Windows covered in prices, lots of talk about discounts, vouchers, all sorts of things to try and get you to part with your money."
Personal mobility.
Here by the main we're talking about the motor car.
"The advent of the private car has made a greater percentage of the population mobile, we can reach many different areas today by private car."
"And then we've got some factors which I wasn't sure where to put, government regulations  erm  again you'll come on to this later in the year  deregulation of the airlines allowing free competition between airlines and low prices."
"Issuing of passports, currency exchange controls  these can be both enabling and motivating factors."
"And finally, the big one, the impact of the mass media."
Everything from newspapers to television  movies  the lot.
"And so while these things here enable us to leave home, if you like, these things are buzzing round in our head and in marketing these are things we have to look at  in order to, we have to be able to make  product  and then try and assess how will the  tourist or potential tourist respond to this."
What will they think about it.
"And so  just gonna do a diagram now, just look at buying influences."
What are the things which actually are going through someone's head when they buy a product.
"You don't need to list all of these, just the headings are fine."
"We've got both, if you like, cultural motivations in our head."
"Cultural beliefs, values and lifestyles."
say at the top
Er that's just buying behaviour.
Patterns of buying behaviour.
"So the first things going through a buyer's head, or that will influence them, will be the sort of lifestyle they're actually looking for."
"The value they're attaching to this holiday, is it an important element for them?"
Is it the one thing in the year for them.
Are they just doing it quickly as a one off?
What do they expect to get out of the holiday?
Now so far we've talked about things like recharging the batteries.
What other things is people likely to get out of a holiday though?
"Imagine when you go on holiday, what other things are you hoping to get as a result of it?"
A sun tan.
"Right, a sun tan."
Well you're probably only doing that though in order to impress people when you go back.
That's correct.
"Yes, so you're privatised?"
That's correct.
Yeah.
"Just to make a party point, is that all right?"
Even accepting the fact that training is desirable I think that the trust law is so complex
I know.
"That it's very, very difficult indeed to be trained to know all the parts of it."
In the last analysis is the innate honesty of a trustee who realises that perhaps something is going right and takes  advice.
"Could we just quickly, who should pay for the training of the trustees, employer or the trust?"
The trust.
The trust?
"The trust, yes."
Pen pension fund.
Very very good.
David?
"Of course the role of the trustees is, is, is  re- affirmed really by Good who er says that there under the under trust or as he sees it, the trustees should remain the legal owners of the fund and I wonder if we can move on to ownership."
"I I think you were all here listening to the erm  pensioners before you were they were talking about their ideas which were also our ideas in our er report on the designated ownership of, of the pension funds and in particular they had a couple of ideas which you may have heard about having the word pension in the in the names, just technical points, er pension in the names of er of the funds and and people who were er giving advice on behalf of them."
I wonder if you could like anybody would like to elaborate on that?
We'll start at the far end.
"Can I, can I just pass for a minute and think on this one and come back."
Mm
I will pass as well temporarily.
Erm
"It's really sorry, it's really the, the question of whether the the the  the pension fund belongs to the trustees or is it  has been found"
"Well erm in our organisation and it was in our submission that we felt that it er it should belong wholly to erm the employer erm it should belong to the beneficiaries as well, because we feel very strongly that the pension is deferred pay, it is deferred salary, and therefore they should have an ownership of part ownership in that fund."
"They pay in six per cent of their salary, why should they be debarred from saying that they own part of those funds."
"We feel that erm you know that they're both very good schemes an and well run, but we still feel that erm the e fund should not be owned entirely er by the employer."
British Steel?
Thank you.
"Well  we consider that er pensions er contributions are deferred pay, including the employers contributions erm that the fund should be held on trust by the trustees and that the employer should have no ownership in it whatsoever."
Very good.
"so I'm saying ah that's that and that, that, so I basically have  we were looking at erm, what's it?"
"Partnerships, did you know that if I start a partnership with Phil right, mum"
Mm
I will be completely liable for erm   liability
Yes
"but that's, wouldn't affect me because I'll be taking loans out  so there and I can have up to twenty er partners, nineteen in fact, because there's twenty partners altogether, basically, so there is definitely benefits for being in partnership"
"as if er, there's not, if you've got twenty partners or there's twenty of you altogether you're splitting profit twenty ways"
"I'm not having twenty partners, I'm having Phil and that's it"
"What, we'll sort it out later"
Erm
when you've got the capital right?
"Erm, but sole, we're looking at sole proprietor as well, there's some good things in that, I E they're cheap to set up, stuff like that, so they're not bad as they go, but, I suppose well I'll have to sell when I've got more money, I didn't get any replies today  not a single blooming one, I'm a bit cheesed off, so erm, I think I might ring back that one of the ones that I did get a reply from and say thank you."
I would leave it for a while Richard
Well dad said I should say something
I would just leave it for a while
"But er, it's all I've had for now I suppose,oh God  I've got maths tomorrow, hate maths"
No you don't
I do
"Well that is, that is a really stupid attitude to go into isn't it?"
Oh I hate it
No you
be one G C S E I'll fail
"Don't be so silly, if he drops that glass I'm gonna kill him"
Dog went mad when I
Eh?
Sorry?
Dog went mad
"Mm, mm"
"dumping himself and running around and banging into doors and things, stupid mutt, so er, erm give him his Bonio, he gets, he now barks at me when I sit down, till I get up and give him his Bon Bonio mum"
"Mm, mm"
"well he is so cheeky, and you can tell when he's hungry cos he goes back for and stand by it again, sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't"
Well more fool you for letting him
you could get into a situation which is beyond managerial farms anyway because you've got more capital
Are they gonna have the resources to do that though?
From the government.
Ha?
It's from the gov the government
But where does the government get the money from?
The same place it got the  the erm tt the money for
"twenty er twenty  or something in, in loans."
Well
I dunno
"wouldn't you, and that's what's"
Well yeah
"Right  questions er on that , yeah, okay."
"Erm  going back to your point, we, we are operating within the context of a new democracy, right, which is, is, is broadly a kind of democratic  approach erm I E that it's, it's an indication of a sort of  the bourgeois revolution but within that you're saying it's not just a democratic revolution, it's a new democratic revolution and within that there will be elements of socialism being created."
"So we, we are not just creating capitalism per se we are building in that direction er  but there will be elements of socialism there which we can then build on and take us forward."
"So our, our land reform is going to have to reflect that so you would expect to see elements, perhaps, of socialisms being created."
Okay.
"So, so th th that would be some of the thinking which would lie behind sitting down and, and  and drawing up a, a reform document  a land reform document, in the very late nineteen forties."
"Sh I mean to, to my mind, shouldn't the land ownership possibly  one of the key issues cos that is  if you have land ownership and  then you're just paving the way for the new capitalist society and to, you know,according to Marxist theory  which I think is a pretty dodgy one,they have to go from capitalism to achieve socialism"
Right.
"socialists , which is just a load of rubbish if you ask"
Okay.
"But, but, but, but our experience of the past"
did not get the peasants to support us unless we give them that.
Yeah.
"That's right, so that's what I'm"
"saying if, if"
want to do that
abolish land ownership then it would suggest they're going for a ideologically based
Right.
"land reform, if they don't it's suggesting it's just another means of obtaining power by fragmenting"
"Erm or, or a pragmatic in terms of erm you want to minimize disruption, you actually want to get production going and the way to get production going is to give the peasants  the land themselves."
"Why, why erm, does protectionism reduce trade?"
"Reduces the erm, extra erm, revenue you can get from exporting or, or it intro increases the cost of importing"
"Okay, yes, that's, that's one reason, yes."
Reduced through retaliation.
"Okay, yes, leads to retaliation, anything else?"
Leads to loss of market.
"Mm, yes, leads to loss of market, you know."
"If we're self sufficient due to a policy that subsidizes our farmers, we're not going to want to import anything."
"So those are all reasons why  trade in agricultural goods may have fallen, is protectionism in ari agriculture is second to none."
"There's no industry that's erm, as heavily protected as er, as agriculture on a world scale."
"Okay, so what, so what other effects does protectionism have?"
"It reduces er, trade in agricultural goods, anything else?"
What about prices of agricultural goods.
They go up.
"Sorry, sorry what?"
"Prices of, on the world market."
Right they'd certainly go up in the domestic
Yes
"erm, domestic country, or the country where the protectionism is in place."
"Well, that must reduce trade as well, cos if, if prices are high in the domestic market, they're not going to want to sell them in another market are they?"
"No, yes, that's very, very true, and that's the effect of protectionism, is to increase self sufficiency."
"Alright, however, if you want to sell."
"Yes, it increases self sufficiency, what about the prices of agricultural goods on the world market?"
"The size of the world market in agricultural erm, goods and the volatility of prices on the world market?"
"Aren't agricultural prices subsidized twice, they're subsidized to the farmers, so the farmer gets X for growing it which increases the price automatically on the market, but aren't they subsidized so they can be sold abroad?"
"Yes, that's, that's true."
"So that's  well, before we can go in, launch into this, I mean it's often said that erm, er, well, one of the major reasons why agricultural commodity trade hasn't been included in GATT, like virtually every other er, product has been, is because governments are saying, look this is a domestic policy, it's got nothing to do with international trade, we're supporting our farmers, it's a domestic policy."
"It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with trade."
"Now, clearly that's a very naive way of looking at er, protectionism."
"But that's the main argument why agricultural policies have been allowed to increase in their severity, rather than erm, fall."
"That makes no sense, because they're selling that product abroad, the farm product, many of them are."
"They might be, they might be, yes."
Increased consumption.
"Yes, that's right, or right"
Income.
"Yes, income, that's right, incomes have risen, er, and as a result we're consuming more goods, consuming more goods  it, it followed, well not automatically, but there's a likelihood that trade will also, will also rise."
"Okay, so, that's, they're the reasons to account for the rise in absolute values of er, trade in all commodities, what about erm, why has the er, trade in manufactures er, increased as a proportion of total trade?"
"I mean, it's not divorced from the things that we've just been talking about"
"Well, cos incomes have risen so, there's more consumption"
Okay.
"Specialization as well, er"
"Good  right okay, I mean, what income elasticities of demand for"
"Higher for manufactured goods, or high relative to agricultural goods"
"Okay, so, because income elasticities of demand are generally high for manufactured goods as the world economy gets richer, it will want to consume proportionately more of those."
"Right, now, we could all become self sufficient, alright."
But why don't we be become more self sufficient?
"You know, we can produc we could consume a lot more manufactured goods, but that doesn't necessarily mean that trade will rise."
"It's likely that trade will rise, but it doesn't automatically follow."
What's also happened to trade in manufactures?
It's specialized
"That's right, okay."
"to, well, produce constant"
"Yes, that's right, you've got  because the, the market for er, any one say manufactured goods, in theory could be a, a world market now because there are relatively cheap methods of transporting this er, this particular good."
"What's happened is because the potential market has risen, firms have specialized."
"Alright, and this is why we get, erm, cars are an excellent example of this erm."
"You know, Toyota, Toyota's plant down the road in Derby, massive investment, erm, a huge production capacity."
"That makes all the Toyota Corollas, or whatever, not only for the U K, or for Europe, but for all, all, all sales of car throughout, of that particular type of car, throughout the world."
"You know, and even in erm, Japan, they're importing the, the products that are made, made over in Derby."
Why're they doing that?
"It's because manufacturing production erm, or this great scope in manufacturing production for economies of scale."
"Alright, this is why countries have specialized more, because countries specialize more and consumers want to demand,want to consume erm, higher quantities of er, manufactured goods."
Alright.
Trade automatically follows therefore.
"Right, we need the specialization and er, the sort of demand elasticity erm, in that argument to suggest that world tra to explain why world trade has risen."

"She was downstairs now , seeing that the clothes were properly prepared for the wash , so there was no one in the Bird Room but Mamma and the children ."
"Frank was reading up all he could find about some Biblical hero mentioned in the day 's sermon ; Jill lay where she had lain for nearly four long months , and though her face was pale and thin with the confinement , there was an expression on it now sweeter even than health ."

"`` Did you speak , 'm ? ''"
"she asked , smiling back again , without in the least knowing why ."
"`` No , dear ."

I met Mrs. Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer did n't approve of my methods . ''
"`` Have you ever noticed , '' asked Anne reflectively , `` that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable ?"
Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you ?
"Mrs. H. B. DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew did n't approve of my reading fairy tales to the children , and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie was n't coming on fast enough in arithmetic ."
If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better .
"I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her , though I 've never been able to catch him red-handed . ''"
`` Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL 's hopeful son to his saintly name ? ''
"`` Yes , '' laughed Anne , `` but it was really a difficult task ."
"At first , when I called him ` St. Clair ' he would not take the least notice until I 'd spoken two or three times ; and then , when the other boys nudged him , he would look up with such an aggrieved air , as if I 'd called him John or Charlie and he could n't be expected to know I meant him ."
So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him .
I told him his mother wished me to call him St. Clair and I could n't go against her wishes .
He saw it when it was all explained out ... he 's really a very reasonable little fellow ... and he said I could call him St. Clair but that he 'd ` lick the stuffing ' out of any of the boys that tried it .
"Of course , I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language ."
Since then I call him St. Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly .
"He informs me that he means to be a carpenter , but Mrs. DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him . ''"
"The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert 's thoughts , and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes ... gravely , earnestly , hopefully , as youth loves to talk , while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities ."
Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor .
"`` It 's a splendid profession , '' he said enthusiastically ."
`` A fellow has to fight something all through life ... did n't somebody once define man as a fighting animal ?
... and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance ... which are all members one of another .
"I want to do my share of honest , real work in the world , Anne ... add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began ."
The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me .
It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race . ''
"`` I 'd like to add some beauty to life , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` I do n't exactly want to make people KNOW more ... though I know that IS the noblest ambition ... but I 'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me ... to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I had n't been born . ''
"`` I think you 're fulfilling that ambition every day , '' said Gilbert admiringly ."
And he was right .
Anne was one of the children of light by birthright .
"After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it , for the time being at least , as hopeful and lovely and of good report ."
Finally Gilbert rose regretfully .
But I am still waiting your opinion . ''
I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour .
"He looked me all over with a warlike eye , and I saw the challenge at his lips ."
"But either my youth disarmed him , or perhaps his own sense of justice ."
"Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned , and not least Cluny ; the more credit that he took it as he did ."
"`` Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` I think you are too nice and covenanting , but for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman ."
"Upon my honest word , ye may take this money -- it 's what I would tell my son -- and here 's my hand along with it ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXIV THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE QUARREL Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night , and went down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch , whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage ."
"This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan 's great-coat in the bargain , trotting along under the burthen , far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground , like a stout hill pony with a feather ; yet he was a man that , in plain contest , I could have broken on my knee ."
"Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered ; and perhaps without that relief , and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness , I could not have walked at all ."
"I was but new risen from a bed of sickness ; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion ; travelling , as we did , over the most dismal deserts in Scotland , under a cloudy heaven , and with divided hearts among the travellers ."
"For long , we said nothing ; marching alongside or one behind the other , each with a set countenance : I , angry and proud , and drawing what strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings ; Alan angry and ashamed , ashamed that he had lost my money , angry that I should take it so ill ."
"The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind ; and the more I approved of it , the more ashamed I grew of my approval ."
"It would be a fine , handsome , generous thing , indeed , for Alan to turn round and say to me : `` Go , I am in the most danger , and my company only increases yours . ''"
"But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me , and say to him : `` You are in great danger , I am in but little ; your friendship is a burden ; go , take your risks and bear your hardships alone -- '' no , that was impossible ; and even to think of it privily to myself , made my cheeks to burn ."
"And yet Alan had behaved like a child , and -LRB- what is worse -RRB- a treacherous child ."
"Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft ; and yet here he was trudging by my side , without a penny to his name , and by what I could see , quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg ."
"True , I was ready to share it with him ; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness ."
These were the two things uppermost in my mind ; and I could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity .
"So I did the next worst , and said nothing , nor so much as looked once at my companion , save with the tail of my eye ."
"At last , upon the other side of Loch Errocht , going over a smooth , rushy place , where the walking was easy , he could bear it no longer , and came close to me ."
"`` David , '' says he , `` this is no way for two friends to take a small accident ."
I have to say that I 'm sorry ; and so that 's said .
"And now if you have anything , ye 'd better say it . ''"
"`` O , '' says I , `` I have nothing . ''"
He seemed disconcerted ; at which I was meanly pleased .
"`` No , '' said he , with rather a trembling voice , `` but when I say I was to blame ? ''"
"`` Why , of course , ye were to blame , '' said I , coolly ; `` and you will bear me out that I have never reproached you . ''"
"`` Never , '' says he ; `` but ye ken very well that ye 've done worse ."
Are we to part ?
Ye said so once before .
Are ye to say it again ?
"Tommy in bed , Teddy wheezing like a little grampus , Mrs. Jo quite used up , and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once , and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins ."
"Under his quiet management things soon fell into order , for every one felt that he was equal to a dozen conflagrations , and worked with a will at whatever task he gave them ."
"There was no school that morning , but by afternoon the damaged room was put to rights , the invalids were better , and there was time to hear and judge the little culprits quietly ."
"Nat and Tommy told their parts in the mischief , and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the dear old house and all in it ."
"But Dan put on his devil-may-care look , and would not own that there was much harm done ."
"Now , of all things , Mr. Bhaer hated drinking , gambling , and swearing ; smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it , and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy , with whom he had tried to be most forbearing , should take advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden vices , and teach his innocent little lads to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them ."
"He talked long and earnestly to the assembled boys , and ended by saying , with an air of mingled firmness and regret , `` I think Tommy is punished enough , and that scar on his arm will remind him for a long time to let these things alone ."
"Nat 's fright will do for him , for he is really sorry , and does try to obey me ."
"But you , Dan , have been many times forgiven , and yet it does no good ."
"I can not have my boys hurt by your bad example , nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears , so you can say good-bye to them all , and tell Nursey to put up your things in my little black bag . ''"
`` Oh !
"sir , where is he going ? ''"
cried Nat .
"`` To a pleasant place up in the country , where I sometimes send boys when they do n't do well here ."
"Mr. Page is a kind man , and Dan will be happy there if he chooses to do his best . ''"
`` Will he ever come back ? ''
asked Demi .
`` That will depend on himself ; I hope so . ''
"As he spoke , Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page , and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions ."
"`` I wonder if you 'll like it , '' began Jack ."
"`` Sha n't stay if I do n't , '' said Dan coolly ."
`` Where will you go ? ''
asked Nat .
"`` I may go to sea , or out west , or take a look at California , '' answered Dan , with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little boys ."
"`` Oh , do n't !"
"stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here ; do , Dan , '' pleaded Nat , much affected at the whole affair ."
"`` I do n't care where I go , or how long I stay , and I 'll be hanged if I ever come back here , '' with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up his things , every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him ."
"That was the only good-bye he gave the boys , for they were all talking the matter over in the barn when he came down , and he told Nat not to call them ."
"The wagon stood at the door , and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak to Dan , looking so sad that his heart smote him , and he said in a low tone , `` May I say good-bye to Teddy ? ''"
"`` Yes , dear ; go in and kiss him , he will miss his Danny very much . ''"
"No one saw the look in Dan 's eyes as he stooped over the crib , and saw the little face light up at first sight of him , but he heard Mrs. Bhaer say pleadingly , `` Ca n't we give the poor lad one more trial , Fritz ? ''"
"and Mr. Bhaer answer in his steady way , `` My dear , it is not best , so let him go where he can do no harm to others , while they do good to him , and by and by he shall come back , I promise you . ''"
"`` I came back for my mother , '' he explained , `` to take her to the Neverland . ''"
"`` Yes , I know , '' Jane said , `` I have been waiting for you . ''"
"When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously , while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy ."
"`` She is my mother , '' Peter explained ; and Jane descended and stood by his side , with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him ."
"`` He does so need a mother , '' Jane said ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"Wendy admitted rather forlornly ; `` no one knows it so well as I. '' `` Good-bye , '' said Peter to Wendy ; and he rose in the air , and the shameless Jane rose with him ; it was already her easiest way of moving about ."
Wendy rushed to the window .
"`` No , no , '' she cried ."
"`` It is just for spring cleaning time , '' Jane said , `` he wants me always to do his spring cleaning . ''"
"`` If only I could go with you , '' Wendy sighed ."
"`` You see you ca n't fly , '' said Jane ."
Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together .
"Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window , watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars ."
"As you look at Wendy , you may see her hair becoming white , and her figure little again , for all this happened long ago ."
"Jane is now a common grown-up , with a daughter called Margaret ; and every spring cleaning time , except when he forgets , Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland , where she tells him stories about himself , to which he listens eagerly ."
"When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter , who is to be Peter 's mother in turn ; and thus it will go on , so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless ."
"_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens,_Version_1.txt.out"
I THE GRAND TOUR OF THE GARDENS You must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow Peter Pan 's adventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens .
"They are in London , where the King lives , and I used to take David there nearly every day unless he was looking decidedly flushed ."
"No child has ever been in the whole of the Gardens , because it is so soon time to turn back ."
"The reason it is soon time to turn back is that , if you are as small as David , you sleep from twelve to one ."
"If your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one , you could most likely see the whole of them ."
"The Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of omnibuses , over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds up her finger to any one of them it stops immediately ."
She then crosses with you in safety to the other side .
"There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate , but that is the one you go in at , and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons , who sits just outside ."
"This is as near to being inside as she may venture , because , if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment , the balloons would lift her up , and she would be flown away ."
"She sits very squat , for the balloons are always tugging at her , and the strain has given her quite a red face ."
"Once she was a new one , because the old one had let go , and David was very sorry for the old one , but as she did let go , he wished he had been there to see ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The Hump , which is the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run -RSB- The Gardens are a tremendous big place , with millions and hundreds of trees ; and first you come to the Figs , but you scorn to loiter there , for the Figs is the resort of superior little persons , who are forbidden to mix with the commonalty , and is so named , according to legend , because they dress in full fig ."
"These dainty ones are themselves contemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes , and you have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the Gardens when I tell you that cricket is called crickets here ."
"Occasionally a rebel Fig climbs over the fence into the world , and such a one was Miss Mabel Grey , of whom I shall tell you when we come to Miss Mabel Grey 's gate ."
"`` Mr. Hyde told me ; he 's been among 'em , and can talk their talk , and likes 'em , '' began Dan , flattered by their attention , but rather embarrassed by having a grown-up listener ."
`` What is wampum for ? ''
"asked curious Demi , from his perch ."
"The others asked questions likewise , and , before he knew it , Dan was reeling off all Mr. Hyde had told him , as they sailed down the river a few weeks before ."
"Mr. Laurie listened well , but found the boy more interesting than the Indians , for Mrs. Jo had told him about Dan , and he rather took a fancy to the wild lad , who ran away as he himself had often longed to do , and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and patience ."
"`` I 've been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own ; a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find , and make , and have given you ."
"Mrs. Jo is too kind to complain , but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps , half-a-pint of dor-bugs in one of her best vases , for instance , a couple of dead bats nailed up in the back entry , wasps nests tumbling down on people 's heads , and stones lying round everywhere , enough to pave the avenue ."
"There are not many women who would stand that sort of thing , are there , now ? ''"
"As Mr. Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes , the boys laughed and nudged one another , for it was evident that some one told tales out of school , else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient treasures ."
"`` Where can we put them , then ? ''"
"said Demi , crossing his legs and leaning down to argue the question ."
`` In the old carriage-house . ''
"`` But it leaks , and there is n't any window , nor any place to put things , and it 's all dust and cobwebs , '' began Nat ."
"`` Wait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit , and then see how you like it ."
"He is to come over on Monday to get it ready ; then next Saturday I shall come out , and we will fix it up , and make the beginning , at least , of a fine little museum ."
"Every one can bring his things , and have a place for them ; and Dan is to be the head man , because he knows most about such matters , and it will be quiet , pleasant work for him now that he ca n't knock about much . ''"
`` Wo n't that be jolly ? ''
"cried Nat , while Dan smiled all over his face and had not a word to say , but hugged his book , and looked at Mr. Laurie as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever blessed the world ."
"`` Shall I go round again , sir ? ''"
"asked Peter , as they came to the gate , after two slow turns about the half-mile triangle ."
"`` No , we must be prudent , else we ca n't come again ."
"I must go over the premises , take a look at the carriage-house , and have a little talk with Mrs. Jo before I go ; '' and , having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and enjoy his book , Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who were raging about the place in search of him ."
"Leaving the little girls to mess up-stairs , Mrs. Bhaer sat down by Dan , and listened to his eager account of the drive till the flock returned , dusty , warm , and much excited about the new museum , which every one considered the most brilliant idea of the age ."
"`` I always wanted to endow some sort of an institution , and I am going to begin with this , '' said Mr. Laurie , sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo 's feet ."
`` You have endowed one already .
What do you call this ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo pointed to the happy-faced lads , who had camped upon the floor about him ."
"`` I call it a very promising Bhaer-garden , and I 'm proud to be a member of it ."
Did you know I was the head boy in this school ? ''
"he asked , turning to Dan , and changing the subject skilfully , for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did ."
`` I thought Franz was ! ''
"answered Dan , wondering what the man meant ."
"I frolicked in the park with dogs , sailed boats in the Back Bay with strange boys , dined with a little Irish beggar-girl on salt fish and potatoes , and was found at last fast asleep on a door-step with my arms round a great dog ."
"It was late in the evening , and I was a dirty as a little pig , and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled so far . ''"
`` How nice ! ''
"cried Nan , looking all ready to go and do it herself ."
`` It was not nice next day ; '' and Mrs. Jo tried to keep her eyes from betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers .
`` Did your mother whip you ? ''
"asked Nan , curiously ."
"`` She never whipped me but once , and then she begged my pardon , or I do n't think I ever should have forgiven her , it hurt my feelings so much . ''"
`` Why did she beg your pardon ?
my father do n't . ''
"`` Because , when she had done it , I turned round and said , ` Well , you are mad yourself , and ought to be whipped as much as me . '"
"She looked at me a minute , then her anger all died out , and she said , as if ashamed , ` You are right , Jo , I am angry ; and why should I punish you for being in a passion when I set you such a bad example ?"
"Forgive me , dear , and let us try to help one another in a better way . '"
"I never forgot it , and it did me more good than a dozen rods . ''"
"Nan sat thoughtfully turning the little cold-cream jar for a minute , and Mrs. Jo said nothing , but let that idea get well into the busy little mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her ."
"`` I like that , '' said Nan , presently , and her face looked less elfish , with its sharp eyes , inquisitive nose , and mischievous mouth ."
`` What did your mother do to you when you ran away that time ? ''
"`` She tied me to the bed-post with a long string , so that I could not go out of the room , and there I stayed all day with the little worn-out shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault . ''"
"`` I should think that would cure anybody , '' cried Nan , who loved her liberty above all things ."
"`` It did cure me , and I think it will you , so I am going to try it , '' said Mrs. Jo , suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her work-table ."
"Nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument now , and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs. Jo tied one end round her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa , saying , as she finished , `` I do n't like to tie you up like a naughty little dog , but if you do n't remember any better than a dog , I must treat you like one . ''"
"`` I 'd just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog ; '' and Nan put on a do n't - care face , and began to growl and grovel on the floor ."
"Mrs. Jo took no notice , but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to hem , she went away , and left Miss Nan to her own devices ."
"This was not agreeable , and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord ."
"But it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind , so she began on the knot at the other end ."
"It soon came loose , and , gathering it up , Nan was about to get out of the window , when she heard Mrs. Jo say to somebody as she passed through the hall , `` No , I do n't think she will run away now ; she is an honorable little girl , and knows that I do it to help her . ''"
"In a minute , Nan whisked back , tied herself up , and began to sew violently ."
"Rob came in a moment after , and was so charmed with the new punishment , that he got a jump-rope and tethered himself to the other arm of the sofa in the most social manner ."
"`` I got lost too , so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan , '' he explained to his mother when she saw the new captive ."
"`` I 'm not sure that you do n't deserve a little punishment , for you knew it was wrong to go far away from the rest . ''"
"`` Nan took me , '' began Rob , willing to enjoy the novel penalty , but not willing to take the blame ."
`` You need n't have gone .
"laughed Jack , adding , with great interest , `` What did the other fellow do ? ''"
"`` He went about fighting other people 's battles , helping the poor , and trying to do good ."
"But he lacked judgment , so he often got into trouble , and was in such a hurry that he did not always stop to find out the wisest way ."
"As when he gave away his best coat to a beggar boy , instead of the old one which he intended to give . ''"
"`` I say , that is n't fair , mother !"
"Neither of them was new , and the boy needed the best more than I did , and I wore the old one all winter , did n't I ? ''"
"asked Jack , who had rather exulted over Frank , and was now taken down himself ."
"`` Yes , you did , my dear ; and it was not an easy thing for my dandiprat to do ."
"Now listen , and I 'll tell you how they both learned to be wiser ."
"The elder prince soon found that the big dragons were too much for him , and set about training his own little one , who now and then ran away with him ."
"Its name was Will , a good servant , but a bad master ; so he learned to control it , and in time this gave him great power over himself , and fitted him to be a king over others . ''"
"`` Thank you , mother ; I 'll remember my part of the moral ."
"Now give Jack his , '' said Frank , who liked the dragon episode , as he had been wrestling with his own of late , and found it hard to manage ."
"`` He had a fine example before him in a friend , and he followed it more reasonably till he grew able to use wisely one of the best and noblest gifts of God -- benevolence . ''"
`` Now tell about the girl .
Was there more to that part of the story ? ''
"asked Jack , well pleased with his moral , as it took Ed in likewise ."
"`` That is the best of all , but it seems as if I never should get to it ."
"After Patience made Lucy sweet and cheerful , she began to have a curious power over those about her , and to work little miracles herself , though she did not know it ."
"The queen learned to love her so dearly she could not let her go ; she cheered up all her friends when they came with their small troubles ; the princes found bright eyes , willing hands , and a kind heart always at their service , and felt , without quite knowing why , that it was good for them to have a gentle little creature to care for ; so they softened their rough manners , loud voices , and careless ways , for her sake , and when it was proposed to take her away to her own home they could not give her up , but said she must stay longer , did n't they ? ''"
"`` I 'd like to see them saying anything else , '' said Frank , while Jack sat up to demand fiercely , -- `` Who talks about taking Jill away ? ''"
"`` Lucy 's mother thought she ought to go , and said so , but the queen told her how much good it did them all to have her there , and begged the dear woman to let her little cottage and come and be housekeeper in the palace , for the queen was getting lazy , and liked to sit and read , and talk and sew with Lucy , better than to look after things . ''"
`` And she said she would ? ''
"cried Jill , clasping her hands in her anxiety , for she had learned to love her cage now ."
`` Yes . ''
"Mrs. Minot had no time to say more , for one of the red slippers flew up in the air , and Jack had to clap both hands over his mouth to suppress the `` hurrah ! ''"
that nearly escaped .
"Frank said , `` That 's good ! ''"
"and nodded with his most cordial smile at Jill who pulled herself up with cheeks now as rosy as the red carnation , and a little catch in her breath as she said to herself , -- `` It 's too lovely to be true . ''"
"`` That 's a first-rate end to a very good story , '' began Jack , with grave decision , as he put on his slipper and sat up to pat Jill 's hand , wishing it was not quite so like a little claw ."
"`` That 's not the end ; '' and Mamma 's eyes laughed more than ever as three astonished faces turned to her , and three voices cried out , -- `` Still more ? ''"
`` The very best of all .
"` Spare me a morsel , Ardan son of Gorla , ' asked a raven , fluttering down towards him ."
"` Seek food elsewhere , O bearer of ill-news , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ` it is but little I have for myself . '"
"And he stretched himself out for a few moments , then rose to his feet again ."
"On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests , and the brightness died out of the sky , and a darkness fell over the earth ."
"On and on , and on , till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it ."
"The door was opened and he entered , but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire , while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver ."
"` Welcome , fair youth , ' said the old man , turning his head ."
"` Sit down and warm yourself , and tell me how fares the outer world ."
It is long since I have seen it . '
"` All my news is that I am seeking service , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ' I have come from far since sunrise , and glad was I to see the rays of your lamp stream into the darkness . ' '"
"I need someone to herd my three dun cows , which are hornless , ' said the old man ."
"` If , for the space of a year , you can bring them back to me each evening before the sun sets , I will make you payment that will satisfy your soul . '"
But here the girl looked up and answered quickly : ` Ill will come of it if he listens to your offer . '
"` Counsel unsought is worth nothing , ' replied , rudely , Ardan son of Gorla ."
` It would be little indeed that I am fit for if I can not drive three cows out to pasture and keep them safe from the wolves that may come down from the mountains .
"Therefore , good father , I will take service with you at daybreak , and ask no payment till the new year dawns . '"
"Next morning the bell of the deer was not heard amongst the fern before the maiden with the hair of gold had milked the cows , and led them in front of the cottage where the old man and Ardan son of Gorla awaited them ."
"` Let them wander where they will , ' he said to his servant , ` and never seek to turn them from their way , for well they know the fields of good pasture ."
"But take heed to follow always behind them , and suffer nothing that you see , and nought that you hear , to draw you into leaving them ."
"Now go , and may wisdom go with you . '"
"As he ceased speaking he touched one of the cows on her forehead , and she stepped along the path , with the two others one on each side ."
"As he had been bidden , behind them came Ardan son of Gorla , rejoicing in his heart that work so easy had fallen to his lot ."
"At the year 's end , thought he , enough money would lie in his pocket to carry him into far countries where his sister might be , and , in the meanwhile , someone might come past who could give him tidings of her ."
"Thus he spoke to himself , when his eyes fell on a golden cock and a silver hen running swiftly along the grass in front of him ."
In a moment the words that the old man had uttered vanished from his mind and he gave chase .
"They were so near that he could almost seize their tails , yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air ."
"At length he could run no more , and stopped to breathe , while the cock and hen went on as before ."
"Then he remembered the cows , and , somewhat frightened , turned back to seek them ."
"Luckily they had not strayed far , and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass ."
"Ardan son of Gorla was sitting under a tree , when he beheld a staff of gold and a staff of silver doubling themselves in strange ways on the meadow in front of him , and starting up he hastened towards them ."
"He followed them till he was tired , but he could not catch them , though they seemed ever within his reach ."
"When at last he gave up the quest his knees trembled beneath him for very weariness , and glad was he to see a tree growing close by lade with fruits of different sorts , of which he ate greedily ."
`` We 'd like to have him .
"The little wagon is all ready for the girls ; you wo n't mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill , will you Aunty ? ''"
`` I should like it exceedingly ; but are you quite sure I shall not be in the way ? ''
"`` Oh , no , indeed !"
"we want you very much ; and the party will be spoilt if you do n't come , '' cried Demi , with great earnestness ."
"`` Thank you kindly , sir ; '' and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey , for she liked frolics as well as any of them ."
"`` Now , young ladies , we must not keep them waiting ; on with the hats , and let us be off at once ."
I 'm all impatience to know what the surprise is . ''
"As Mrs. Bhaer spoke every one bustled about , and in five minutes the three little girls and Teddy were packed into the `` clothes-basket , '' as they called the wicker wagon which Toby drew ."
"Demi walked at the head of the procession , and Mrs. Jo brought up the rear , escorted by Kit ."
"It was a most imposing party , I assure you , for Toby had a red feather-duster in his head , two remarkable flags waved over the carriage , Kit had a blue bow on his neck , which nearly drove him wild , Demi wore a nosegay of dandelions in his buttonhole , and Mrs. Jo carried the queer Japanese umbrella in honor of the occasion ."
"The girls had little flutters of excitement all the way ; and Teddy was so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard , and when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself , evidently feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the party ."
"When they came to the hill `` nothing was to be seen but the grass blowing in the wind , '' as the fairy books say , and the children looked disappointed ."
"But Demi said , in his most impressive manner , `` Now , you all get out and stand still , and the surprise party with come in ; '' with which remark he retired behind a rock , over which heads had been bobbing at intervals for the last half-hour ."
"A short pause of intense suspense , and then Nat , Demi , and Tommy marched forth , each bearing a new kite , which they presented to the three young ladies ."
"Shrieks of delight arose , but were silenced by the boys , who said , with faces brimful of merriment , `` That is n't all the surprise ; '' and , running behind the rock , again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size , on which was printed , in bright yellow letters , `` For Mother Bhaer . ''"
"`` We thought you 'd like one , too , because you were angry with us , and took the girls ' part , '' cried all three , shaking with laughter , for this part of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs. Jo ."
"She clapped her hands , and joined in the laugh , looking thoroughly tickled at the joke ."
"`` Now , boys , that is regularly splendid !"
Who did think of it ? ''
"she asked , receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did theirs ."
"`` Uncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others ; he said you 'd like it , so we made a bouncer , '' answered Demi , beaming with satisfaction at the success of the plot ."
`` Uncle Fritz knows what I like .
"Yes , these are magnificent kites , and we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours , were n't we , girls ? ''"
"`` That 's why we made them for you , '' cried Tommy , standing on his head as the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions ."
"`` Let us fly them , '' said energetic Nan ."
"`` I do n't know how , '' began Daisy ."
"`` We 'll show you , we want to ! ''"
"cried all the boys in a burst of devotion , as Demi took Daisy 's , Tommy Nan 's , and Nat , with difficulty , persuaded Bess to let go her little blue one ."
"`` Aunty , if you will wait a minute , we 'll pitch yours for you , '' said Demi , feeling that Mrs. Bhaer 's favor must not be lost again by any neglect of theirs ."
"`` Bless your buttons , dear , I know all about it ; and here is a boy who will toss up for me , '' added Mrs. Jo , as the professor peeped over the rock with a face full of fun ."
"He came out at once , tossed up the big kite , and Mrs. Jo ran off with it in fine style , while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle ."
` Then I sha n't be exactly a human ? '
Peter asked .
` No . '
` Nor exactly a bird ? '
` No . '
` What shall I be ? '
"` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , ' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once ; then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs ; and so it went on for ever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , ` Greedy !"
Greedy ! '
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
-LSB- Illustration : The birds on the island never got used to him .
His oddities tickled them every day -RSB- Peter wore no nightgown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
"To be easily pleased , for instance , and always to be really doing something , and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance ."
"Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests ; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon , and nearly as well as a blackbird , though never did he satisfy the finches , and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers ."
"He also became very learned in bird-lore , and knew an east wind from a west wind by its smell , and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks ."
But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart .
"All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests , and so , as they were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about , it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times -RSB- Peter 's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long , just as the birds sing for joy , but , being partly human , he needed an instrument , so he made a pipe of reeds , and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening , practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water , and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon , and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived , and they would say to each other , ` Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe ? '"
"And sometimes he played the birth of birds , and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg ."
"If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge , which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts , but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way ."
"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come , and the chestnut being so near , hears him and is cheated ."
"` Well , but I do n't see how I am to get to you , ' said the Stalo , looking up and down ."
"` Jump over , as I did , ' answered Andras ; ` it is quite easy . '"
"` But I could not jump this river ; and I do n't know how you did , ' replied the Stalo . '"
"I should be ashamed to say such things , ' exclaimed Andras ."
"` Do you mean to tell me that a jump , which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of , is beyond your strength ? '"
"The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words , just as Andras meant him to do ."
He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river .
"Not that that would have mattered , for he was a good swimmer ; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries , and took aim at him ."
"His aim was good , but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet ."
"A second shot , directed at his forehead , fared no better , for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb ."
"Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo 's head , and when he sprang up , just an instant too soon , it hit him between the ribs ."
"Mortally wounded as he was , the Stalo was not yet dead , and managed to swim to the shore ."
"Stretching himself on the sand , he said slowly to Andras : ` Promise that you will give me an honourable burial , and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord , and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me ."
"My dog you must kill , but spare my son , Andras . '"
Then he died ; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy .
"The dog , a fierce , wicked-looking creature , he slew with one blow from his fist , for it is well known that if a Stalo 's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master 's wounds the Stalo comes to life again ."
"That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog ; but the bailiff , being only half a Stalo , had forgotten him , when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras ."
"Next , Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets , and bidding the boy get in , pushed it off from the shore , leaving the little craft to drift as it would , while he himself ran home ."
"With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer ; and he soon married a rich wife , whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor , and the two lived happy for ever after ."
"The White Slipper -LSB- From Lapplandische Mahrchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old .
And what a daughter !
"Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them ; and , as for the fathers , if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards ."
"Of course the king , whose name was Balancin , was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother ; indeed , he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love ."
"Now Diamantina , for that was her name , did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven ; but be the suitor who he might , the king always said him nay ."
"Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills , and more than one river flowed through ."
"Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset , attended by her ladies , and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms ."
"She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms , and a basket to put them in , so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly ."
"When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town , so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her , and telling her of their troubles ; and then she would seek out her father , and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it ."
But what has all this to do with the White Slipper ?
my readers will ask .
"Have patience , and you will see ."
"we 'll say hunting -- they found a little damsel lying on the snow , half dead with cold , they thought ."
"She was the child of a poor woman who lived in the forest -- a wild little thing , always dancing and singing about ; as hard to catch as a squirrel , and so fearless she would climb the highest trees , leap broad brooks , or jump off the steep rocks to show her courage ."
"The boys carried her home to the palace , and the queen was glad to have her ."
"She had fallen and hurt herself , so she lay in bed week after week , with her mother to take care of her -- '' `` That 's you , '' whispered Jack , throwing the white carnation at Jill , and she threw back the red one , with her finger on her lips , for the tale was very interesting now ."
"`` She did not suffer much after a time , but she scolded and cried , and could not be resigned , because she was a prisoner ."
"The queen tried to help her , but she could not do much ; the princes were kind , but they had their books and plays , and were away a good deal ."
"Some friends she had came often to see her , but still she beat her wings against the bars , like a wild bird in a cage , and soon her spirits were all gone , and it was sad to see her . ''"
`` Where was your Saint Lucy ?
"I thought it was about her , '' asked Jack , who did not like to have Jill 's past troubles dwelt upon , since his were not ."
`` She is coming .
"Saints are not born -- they are made after many trials and tribulations , '' answered his mother , looking at the fire as if it helped her to spin her little story ."
"`` Well , the poor child used to sing sometimes to while away the long hours -- sad songs mostly , and one among them which the queen taught her was ` Sweet Patience , Come . '"
"`` This she used to sing a great deal after a while , never dreaming that Patience was an angel who could hear and obey ."
"But it was so ; and one night , when the girl had lulled herself to sleep with that song , the angel came ."
"Nobody saw the lovely spirit with tender eyes , and a voice that was like balm ."
"No one heard the rustle of wings as she hovered over the little bed and touched the lips , the eyes , the hands of the sleeper , and then flew away , leaving three gifts behind ."
"The girl did not know why , but after that night the songs grew gayer , there seemed to be more sunshine everywhere her eyes looked , and her hands were never tired of helping others in various pretty , useful , or pleasant ways ."
"Slowly the wild bird ceased to beat against the bars , but sat in its cage and made music for all in the palace , till the queen could not do without it , the poor mother cheered up , and the princes called the girl their nightingale . ''"
`` Was that the miracle ? ''
"asked Jack , forgetting all about his slippers , as he watched Jill 's eyes brighten and the color come up in her white cheeks ."
"`` That was the miracle , and Patience can work far greater ones if you will let her . ''"
`` And the girl 's name was Lucy ? ''
"`` Yes ; they did not call her a saint then , but she was trying to be as cheerful as a certain good woman she had heard of , and so the queen had that name for her , though she did not let her know it for a long time . ''"
"`` That 's not bad for a Sunday story , but there might have been more about the princes , seems to me , '' was Frank 's criticism , as Jill lay very still , trying to hide her face behind the carnation , for she had no words to tell how touched and pleased she was to find that her little efforts to be good had been seen , remembered , and now rewarded in this way ."
`` There is more . ''
`` Then the story is n't done ? ''
cried Jack .
"`` Oh dear , no ; the most interesting things are to come , if you can wait for them . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , this is the moral part ."
"Now keep still , and let us have the rest , '' commanded Frank , while the others composed themselves for the sequel , suspecting that it was rather nice , because Mamma 's sober face changed , and her eyes laughed as they looked at the fire ."
"`` The elder prince was very fond of driving dragons , for the people of that country used these fiery monsters as horses . ''"
"`` And got run away with , did n't he ? ''"
"If this reformation goes on as it has begun , I shall soon feel like Dr. Blimber with his model young gentlemen , '' said Professor , laughing , as he saw Tommy not only remove his own hat , but knock off Ned 's also , as they entered the hall where the Princess was taking a ride on the rocking-horse , attended by Rob and Teddy astride of chairs , and playing gallant knights to the best of their ability ."
"`` You will never be a Blimber , Fritz , you could n't do it if you tried ; and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous hot-bed ."
No fear that they will be too elegant : American boys like liberty too well .
"But good manners they can not fail to have , if we give them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor , making it courteous and cordial , like yours , my dear old boy . ''"
`` Tut !
tut !
"we will not compliment ; for if I begin you will run away , and I have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end ; '' yet Mr. Bhaer looked pleased with the compliment , for it was true , and Mrs. Jo felt that she had received the best her husband could give her , by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society ."
"`` To return to the children : I have just had another proof of Goldilocks ' good influence , '' said Mrs. Jo , drawing her chair nearer the sofa , where the Professor lay resting after a long day 's work in his various gardens ."
"`` Nan hates sewing , but for love of Bess has been toiling half the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our love-apples to her idol when she goes ."
"I praised her for it , and she said , in her quick way , ' I like to sew for other people ; it is stupid sewing for myself . '"
"I took the hint , and shall give her some little shirts and aprons for Mrs. Carney 's children ."
"She is so generous , she will sew her fingers sore for them , and I shall not have to make a task of it . ''"
"`` But needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment , my dear . ''"
`` Sorry for it .
"My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it , even if they give up the Latin , Algebra , and half-a-dozen ologies it is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over now-a-days ."
"Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman , but the dear 's mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already , and her mother has several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird without a bill , that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it . ''"
"`` I also have proof of the Princess 's power , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , after he had watched Mrs. Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole system of fashionable education ."
"`` Jack is so unwilling to be classed with Stuffy and Ned , as distasteful to Bess , that he came to me a little while ago , and asked me to touch his warts with caustic ."
"I have often proposed it , and he never would consent ; but now he bore the smart manfully , and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor , when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the story , and just then Stuffy came in to ask if he might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him ."
"`` She is not allowed to eat sweeties ; but if you like to give her the pretty box with the pink sugar-rose in it , she would like it very much , '' said Mrs. Jo , unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of self-denial , for the `` fat boy '' seldom offered to share his sugar-plums ."
`` Wo n't she eat it ?
"I should n't like to make her sick , '' said Stuffy , eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly , yet putting it into the box ."
"`` Oh , no , she wo n't touch it , if I tell her it is to look at , not to eat ."
"She will keep it for weeks , and never think of tasting it ."
Can you do as much ? ''
`` I should hope so !
"I 'm ever so much older than she is , '' cried Stuffy , indignantly ."
"`` Well , suppose we try ."
"Here , put your bonbons in this bag , and see how long you can keep them ."
"Let me count two hearts , four red fishes , three barley-sugar horses , nine almonds , and a dozen chocolate drops ."
Do you agree to that ? ''
`` Tarry we no more . ''
"In the chancel they found Dick waiting , attended by a few young men ; and there were he and Joan united ."
"When they came forth again , happy and yet serious , into the frosty air and sunlight , the long files of the army were already winding forward up the road ; already the Duke of Gloucester 's banner was unfolded and began to move from before the abbey in a clump of spears ; and behind it , girt by steel-clad knights , the bold , black-hearted , and ambitious hunchback moved on towards his brief kingdom and his lasting infamy ."
"But the wedding party turned upon the other side , and sat down , with sober merriment , to breakfast ."
"The father cellarer attended on their wants , and sat with them at table ."
"Hamley , all jealousy forgotten , began to ply the nowise loth Alicia with courtship ."
"And there , amid the sounding of tuckets and the clash of armoured soldiery and horses continually moving forth , Dick and Joan sat side by side , tenderly held hands , and looked , with ever growing affection , in each other 's eyes ."
Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch passed them by .
They dwelt apart from alarms in the green forest where their love began .
"Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great prosperity and peace , and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine , in Tunstall hamlet ."
"One had been all his life a shipman , and continued to the last to lament his man Tom ."
"The other , who had been a bit of everything , turned in the end towards piety , and made a most religious death under the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey ."
"So Lawless had his will , and died a friar ."

_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___Treasure_Island.txt.out
"PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof ."
"I remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white ."
"I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
"in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars ."
"Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum ."
"This , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard ."
"`` This is a handy cove , '' says he at length ; `` and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop ."
"Much company , mate ? ''"
"My father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity ."
"`` Well , then , '' said he , `` this is the berth for me ."
"Here you , matey , '' he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; `` bring up alongside and help up my chest ."
"I 'll stay here a bit , '' he continued ."
"`` I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want , and that head up there for to watch ships off ."
What you mought call me ?
You mought call me captain .
"Oh , I see what you 're at -- there '' ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold ."
"`` Better , sir . ''"
"`` Rather tired of the house , are n't you ? ''"
`` Guess I am ! ''
and Dan 's eyes roved away to the green hills and woods where he longed to be .
`` Suppose we take a little turn before the others come back ?
"That big , easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable , and a breath of fresh air will do you good ."
"Get a cushion and a shawl , Demi , and let 's carry Dan off . ''"
"The boys thought it a capital joke , and Dan looked delighted , but asked , with an unexpected burst of virtue , `` Will Mrs. Bhaer like it ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes ; we settled all that a minute ago . ''"
"`` You did n't say any thing about it , so I do n't see how you could , '' said Demi , inquisitively ."
"`` We have a way of sending messages to one another , without any words ."
It is a great improvement on the telegraph . ''
"`` I know it 's eyes ; I saw you lift your eyebrows , and nod toward the carriage , and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again , '' cried Nat , who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time ."
`` Right .
"Now them , come on , '' and in a minute Dan found himself settled in the carriage , his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite , nicely covered with a shawl , which fell down from the upper regions in a most mysterious manner , just when they wanted it ."
"Demi climbed up to the box beside Peter , the black coachman ."
"Nat sat next Dan in the place of honor , while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite , to take care of the foot , he said , but really that he might study the faces before him both so happy , yet so different , for Dan 's was square , and brown , and strong , while Nat 's was long , and fair , and rather weak , but very amiable with its mild eyes and good forehead ."
"`` By the way , I 've got a book somewhere here that you may like to see , '' said the oldest boy of the party , diving under the seat and producing a book which make Dan exclaim , `` Oh !"
"by George , is n't that a stunner ? ''"
"as he turned the leaves , and saw fine plates of butterflies , and birds , and every sort of interesting insect , colored like life ."
"He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks , but Mr. Laurie did not mind , and was quite satisfied to see the boy 's eager delight , and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as he came to them ."
"Nat leaned on his shoulder to look , and Demi turned his back to the horses , and let his feet dangle inside the carriage , so that he might join in the conversation ."
"When they got among the beetles , Mr. Laurie took a curious little object out of his vest-pocket , and laying it in the palm of his hand , said , `` There 's a beetle that is thousands of years old ; '' and then , while the lads examined the queer stone-bug , that looked so old and gray , he told them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy , after lying for ages in a famous tomb ."
"Finding them interested , he went on to tell about the Egyptians , and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them the Nile , and how he sailed up the mighty river , with the handsome dark men to work his boat ; how he shot alligators , saw wonderful beasts and birds ; and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel , who pitched him about like a ship in a storm ."
"`` Uncle Teddy tells stories ` most as well as Grandpa , '' said Demi , approvingly , when the tale was done , and the boys ' eyes asked for more ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Mr. Laurie , quite soberly , for he considered Demi 's praise worth having , for children are good critics in such cases , and to suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of ."
"`` Here 's another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was turning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan , '' and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrow-head and a string of wampum ."
`` Oh !
"tell about the Indians , '' cried Demi , who was fond of playing wigwam ."
"`` Dan knows lots about them , '' added Nat ."
"`` More than I do , I dare say ."
"Tell us something , '' and Mr. Laurie looked as interested as the other two ."
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as ` Slay her ! '
` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! '
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"` Anything except that , ' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies echoed , ` Anything except that . '"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her -- that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , ' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"` And it might melt , ' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"` Build a house round her , ' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation-stone , and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning-lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Queen Mab , who rules in the Gardens -RSB- The house was exactly the size of Maimie , and perfectly lovely ."
"One of her arms was extended , and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"` Now we fear it is quite finished , ' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"` That certainly finishes it , ' they said reluctantly ."
"` Not at all , ' cried a glow-worm ; ` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . '"
"` Wait one moment , ' said a china merchant , ` and I shall make you a saucer . '"
"Then they all took ship and sailed home , and when they came to the princess 's country , Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom , and went up to the palace alone ."
"He was given a hearty welcome by the king , who prided himself on his hospitality , and a banquet was commanded in his honour ."
"That evening , whilst they sat drinking their wine , Hans said to the king : ' I have heard the fame of your majesty 's wisdom , and I have travelled from far to ask your counsel ."
A man in my country has buried his daughter alive because she loved a youth who was born a peasant .
"How shall I punish this unnatural father , for it is left to me to give judgment ? '"
"The king , who was still truly grieved for his daughter 's loss , answered quickly : ` Burn him alive , and strew his ashes all over the kingdom . '"
"Hans looked at him steadily for a moment , and then threw off his disguise ."
"` You are the man , ' said he ; ` and I am he who loved your daughter , and became a gold ring on her finger ."
"She is safe , and waiting not far from here ; but you have pronounced judgment on yourself . '"
"Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy ; and as he had in other respects been a good father , they forgave him ."
The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month .
As for the hill-man he intended to be present ; but whilst he was walking along a street which led to the palace a loose stone fell on his head and killed him .

"The Cat 's Elopement -LSB- From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty , with a skin as soft and shining as silk , and wise green eyes , that could see even in the dark ."
"His name was Gon , and he belonged to a music teacher , who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world ."
Now not far from the music master 's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma .
"She was such a little dear altogether , and blinked her eyes so daintily , and ate her supper so tidily , and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue , that her mistress was never tired of saying , ` Koma , Koma , what should I do without you ? '"
"Well , it happened one day that these two , when out for an evening stroll , met under a cherry tree , and in one moment fell madly in love with each other ."
"Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife , for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy ; but he was not easy to please , and did not care about any of them ."
"Now , before he had time to think , Cupid had entangled him in his net , and he was filled with love towards Koma ."
"She fully returned his passion , but , like a woman , she saw the difficulties in the way , and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them ."
"Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma , but her mistress would not part from her ."
"Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady , but he declined to listen to any such suggestion , so everything remained as before ."
"At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves , and to seek their fortunes together ."
"So one moonlight night they stole away , and ventured out into an unknown world ."
"All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine , till they had left their homes far behind them , and towards evening they found themselves in a large park ."
"The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired , and the grass looked very soft and inviting , and the trees cast cool deep shadows , when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise , in the shape of a big , big dog !"
"He came springing towards them showing all his teeth , and Koma shrieked , and rushed up a cherry tree ."
"Gon , however , stood his ground boldly , and prepared to give battle , for he felt that Koma 's eyes were upon him , and that he must not run away ."
"But , alas !"
"his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him , for he was large and powerful , and very fierce ."
"Merry hated clearing up , but dutifully did every distasteful task , and kept her eye on careless Roxy till all was in order ; then she gladly went to perch on her father 's knee , seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the `` little one . ''"
"`` Yes , I do want something , but I know you will say it is silly , '' she began , as her father pinched her blooming cheek , with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well ."
"`` Should n't wonder if it was a doll now ; '' and Mr. Grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile , as if she was about six instead of fifteen ."
"`` Why , father , you know I do n't !"
I have n't played with dollies for years and years .
"No ; I want to fix up my room pretty , like Jill 's ."
"I 'll do it all myself , and only want a few things , for I do n't expect it to look as nice as hers . ''"
"Indignation gave Merry courage to state her wishes boldly , though she knew the boys would laugh ."
"They did , and her mother said in a tone of surprise , -- `` Why , child , what more can you want ?"
"I 'm sure your room is always as neat as a new pin , thanks to your bringing up , and I told you to have a fire there whenever you wanted to . ''"
"`` Let me have some old things out of the garret , and I 'll show you what I want ."
"It is neat , but so bare and ugly I hate to be there ."
I do so love something pretty to look at ! ''
and Merry gave a little shiver of disgust as she turned her eyes away from the large greasy boot Dick was holding up to be sure it was well lubricated all round .
"`` So do I , and that 's a fact ."
"I could n't get on without my pretty girl here , any way ."
"Why , she touches up the old place better than a dozen flower-pots in full blow , '' said the farmer , as his eye went from the scarlet geranium to the bright young face so near his own ."
`` I wish I had a dozen in the sitting-room window .
"Mother says they are not tidy , but I 'd keep them neat , and I know you 'd like it , '' broke in Merry , glad of the chance to get one of the long-desired wishes of her heart fulfilled ."
`` I 'll fetch you some next time I go over to Ballad 's .
"Tell me what you want , and we 'll have a posy bed somewhere round , see if we do n't , '' said her father , dimly understanding what she wanted ."
"`` Now , if mother says I may fix my room , I shall be satisfied , and I 'll do my chores without a bit of fuss , to show how grateful I am , '' said the girl , thanking her father with a kiss , and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse ."
`` You may have anything you like out of the blue chest .
"There 's a lot of things there that the moths got at after Grandma died , and I could n't bear to throw or give 'em away ."
"Trim up your room as you like , and mind you do n't forget your part of the bargain , '' answered Mrs. Grant , seeing profit in the plan ."
"`` I wo n't ; I 'll work all the morning to-morrow , and in the afternoon I 'll get ready to show you what I call a nice , pretty room , '' answered Merry , looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen ."
"She kept her word , and the very stormy afternoon when Jill got into trouble , Merry was working busily at her little bower ."
"In the blue chest she found a variety of treasures , and ignoring the moth holes , used them to the best advantage , trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance which prevailed in Mrs. Minot 's back bedroom ."
"Three faded red-moreen curtains went up at the windows over the chilly paper shades , giving a pleasant glow to the bare walls ."
"A red quilt with white stars , rather the worse for many washings , covered the bed , and a gay cloth the table , where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots ."
"The little air-tight stove was banished , and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the fire-light ."
"Grandma 's last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth , and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau , over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt , tied up with Merry 's red sash ."
"He gave me one look as much as to say , `` Well done , David ! ''"
and off he set again at his top speed .
It grew cooler and even a little darker -LRB- but not much -RRB- with the coming of the night .
"The sky was cloudless ; it was still early in July , and pretty far north ; in the darkest part of that night , you would have needed pretty good eyes to read , but for all that , I have often seen it darker in a winter mid-day ."
Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain ; and this refreshed me for a while .
"When we stopped to breathe , and I had time to see all about me , the clearness and sweetness of the night , the shapes of the hills like things asleep , and the fire dwindling away behind us , like a bright spot in the midst of the moor , anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm ."
"By what I have read in books , I think few that have held a pen were ever really wearied , or they would write of it more strongly ."
"I had no care of my life , neither past nor future , and I scarce remembered there was such a lad as David Balfour ."
"I did not think of myself , but just of each fresh step which I was sure would be my last , with despair -- and of Alan , who was the cause of it , with hatred ."
"Alan was in the right trade as a soldier ; this is the officer 's part to make men continue to do things , they know not wherefore , and when , if the choice was offered , they would lie down where they were and be killed ."
"And I dare say I would have made a good enough private ; for in these last hours it never occurred to me that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able , and die obeying ."
"Day began to come in , after years , I thought ; and by that time we were past the greatest danger , and could walk upon our feet like men , instead of crawling like brutes ."
"But , dear heart have mercy !"
"what a pair we must have made , going double like old grandfathers , stumbling like babes , and as white as dead folk ."
"Never a word passed between us ; each set his mouth and kept his eyes in front of him , and lifted up his foot and set it down again , like people lifting weights at a country play ; * all the while , with the moorfowl crying `` peep ! ''"
"in the heather , and the light coming slowly clearer in the east ."
* Village fair .
I say Alan did as I did .
"Not that ever I looked at him , for I had enough ado to keep my feet ; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself , and looked as little where we were going , or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men ."
It fell in this way .
"We were going down a heathery brae , Alan leading and I following a pace or two behind , like a fiddler and his wife ; when upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle , three or four ragged men leaped out , and the next moment we were lying on our backs , each with a dirk at his throat ."
I do n't think I cared ; the pain of this rough handling was quite swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full ; and I was too glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk .
"I lay looking up in the face of the man that held me ; and I mind his face was black with the sun , and his eyes very light , but I was not afraid of him ."
I heard Alan and another whispering in the Gaelic ; and what they said was all one to me .
"Then the dirks were put up , our weapons were taken away , and we were set face to face , sitting in the heather ."
"`` They are Cluny 's men , '' said Alan ."
`` We couldnae have fallen better .
"We 're just to bide here with these , which are his out-sentries , till they can get word to the chief of my arrival . ''"
"Now Cluny Macpherson , the chief of the clan Vourich , had been one of the leaders of the great rebellion six years before ; there was a price on his life ; and I had supposed him long ago in France , with the rest of the heads of that desperate party ."
"Even tired as I was , the surprise of what I heard half wakened me ."
"`` What , '' I cried , `` is Cluny still here ? ''"
"`` Ay , is he so ! ''"
"She slept peacefully till midnight , when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke ."
"Everything trembled and shook ; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall ; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations , it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down , and then the roof fell in with a crash ."
"Then all became still , and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep ."
"But when she awoke again in broad daylight , what a sight met her eyes !"
"She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour ; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground ; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet , and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls ."
"The maiden thought she must be dreaming , but in came three servants richly dressed , who asked what were her commands ."
"` Go , ' said the maiden , ' I will get up at once and cook the old man 's supper for him , and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow . '"
"But the door opened and in came a handsome young man , who said , ' I am a king 's son , and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants , who were transformed into a cock , a hen , and a brindled cow ."
The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts .
"You are that maiden , and last night at midnight we were freed , and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace ."
As they stood there the king 's son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden 's parents to be present at the wedding feast .
` But where are my two sisters ? '
asked the maid . '
"I shut them up in the cellar , but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved , and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry . '"
"Uraschimataro and the Turtle From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- ."
"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing ."
"They had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot ."
"This son 's name was Uraschimataro , which means in Japanese , ` Son of the island , ' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather ."
"Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ` If your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . '"
"But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him ."
"One beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle ."
"He was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life ."
"` After all , ' it said , ` what good can I do you ?"
"I am so young and small , and I would so gladly live a little longer ."
"Be merciful and set me free , and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . '"
"Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea ."
"Years flew by , and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea ."
"But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves ."
Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .
"But he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore ."
"Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' I am the turtle whose life you once saved ."
I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude .
`` But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson ? ''
"says he , when I had done ."
"`` I think so , indeed , sir , '' said I. `` Dear doctor ! ''"
"cries he , rubbing his brow ."
`` Dear doctor !
"No , Mr. David , I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible ."
"I say nothing against your friend , Mr. Thomson : I know nothing against him ; and if I did -- mark this , Mr. David !"
-- it would be my duty to lay hands on him .
Now I put it to you : is it wise to meet ?
He may have matters to his charge .
He may not have told you all .
His name may not be even Thomson ! ''
"cries the lawyer , twinkling ; `` for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws . ''"
"`` You must be the judge , sir , '' said I ."
"But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy , for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs. Rankeillor ; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine , ere he was back harping on my proposal ."
"When and where was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson ; was I sure of Mr. T. 's discretion ; supposing we could catch the old fox tripping , would I consent to such and such a term of an agreement -- these and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals , while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue ."
"When I had answered all of them , seemingly to his contentment , he fell into a still deeper muse , even the claret being now forgotten ."
"Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil , and set to work writing and weighing every word ; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber ."
"`` Torrance , '' said he , `` I must have this written out fair against to-night ; and when it is done , you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me , for you will probably be wanted as a witness . ''"
"`` What , sir , '' cried I , as soon as the clerk was gone , `` are you to venture it ? ''"
"`` Why , so it would appear , '' says he , filling his glass ."
`` But let us speak no more of business .
"The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago , when I had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh ."
"Each had gone his proper errand ; and when it came four o'clock , Torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master , and I , who had forgot my spectacles , was so blind without them , that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk . ''"
And thereupon he laughed heartily .
"I said it was an odd chance , and smiled out of politeness ; but what held me all the afternoon in wonder , he kept returning and dwelling on this story , and telling it again with fresh details and laughter ; so that I began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friend 's folly ."
"Towards the time I had appointed with Alan , we set out from the house , Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm , and Torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand ."
"All through the town , the lawyer was bowing right and left , and continually being button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business ; and I could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county ."
"At last we were clear of the houses , and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier , the scene of my misfortune ."
"I could not look upon the place without emotion , recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more : Ransome taken , I could hope , from the evil to come ; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him ; and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge ."
"All these , and the brig herself , I had outlived ; and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scath ."
My only thought should have been of gratitude ; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear .
"And now , '' said she when I had done so , `` we have to get the key off THAT ; and who 's to touch it , I should like to know ! ''"
and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words .
I went down on my knees at once .
"On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper , blackened on the one side ."
"I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT ; and taking it up , I found written on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : `` You have till ten tonight . ''"
"`` He had till ten , Mother , '' said I ; and just as I said it , our old clock began striking ."
"This sudden noise startled us shockingly ; but the news was good , for it was only six ."
"`` Now , Jim , '' she said , `` that key . ''"
"I felt in his pockets , one after another ."
"A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair ."
"`` Perhaps it 's round his neck , '' suggested my mother ."
"Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his own gully , we found the key ."
At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival .
"It was like any other seaman 's chest on the outside , the initial `` B '' burned on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long , rough usage ."
"`` Give me the key , '' said my mother ; and though the lock was very stiff , she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling ."
"A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior , but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brushed and folded ."
"They had never been worn , my mother said ."
"Under that , the miscellany began -- a quadrant , a tin canikin , several sticks of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistols , a piece of bar silver , an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compasses mounted with brass , and five or six curious West Indian shells ."
"I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunted life ."
"In the meantime , we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets , and neither of these were in our way ."
"Underneath there was an old boat-cloak , whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar ."
"My mother pulled it up with impatience , and there lay before us , the last things in the chest , a bundle tied up in oilcloth , and looking like papers , and a canvas bag that gave forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold ."
"`` I 'll show these rogues that I 'm an honest woman , '' said my mother ."
"`` I 'll have my dues , and not a farthing over ."
Hold Mrs. Crossley 's bag . ''
And she began to count over the amount of the captain 's score from the sailor 's bag into the one that I was holding .
"It was a long , difficult business , for the coins were of all countries and sizes -- doubloons , and louis d'ors , and guineas , and pieces of eight , and I know not what besides , all shaken together at random ."
"The guineas , too , were about the scarcest , and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count ."
"When we were about half-way through , I suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth -- the tap-tapping of the blind man 's stick upon the frozen road ."
"It drew nearer and nearer , while we sat holding our breath ."
"Then it struck sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter ; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without ."
"At last the tapping recommenced , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard ."
His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .
And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children .
"But though Stalo was dead , his three sons were still living , and not very far off either ."
"They had gone to their mother , who was tending some reindeer on the pastures , and told her that by some magic , they knew not what , their father 's head had rolled from his body , and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her ."
The ogress said nothing .
"Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were , so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer , while she returned to the other house to bury her husband 's body ."
"Now , three days ' journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma , who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting ."
"Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures , but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away ."
"Unluckily , however , one day , when Lyma was left by herself in the hut , the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage ."
"The country was very lonely , and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her ."
"Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way , but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos ' house ."
When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty .
Loudly they cried : ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
"But no voice answered them ; and they fell to searching all about , lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them ."
"At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow , and they set out to follow it ."
"On and on they went , and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day 's journey would bring them to the Stalos ' dwelling ."
"Of course they did not dare to approach it openly , for the Stalos had the strength of giants , and besides , there were three of them ; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well ."
"` Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here , ' they said to each other ."
"But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came , and as she let down her bucket into the well , the leaves seemed to whisper ` Lyma !"
Lyma ! '
"The girl started and looked up , but could see nothing , and in a moment the voice came again ."
"` Be careful -- take no notice , fill your buckets , but listen carefully all the while , and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also . '"
"So Lyman bent over the well lower than before , and seemed busier than ever ."
"` You know , ' said her brother , ` that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel , but throws it to his dogs ."
"Now , after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire , and the broth is nearly cooked , just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot ."
"The Stalo will soon notice this , and will call you to give all the food to the dogs ; but , instead , you must bring it straight to us , as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk ."
That is all you need do for the present . '
"Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house , and did as her brothers had told her ."
"They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking , but when there was nothing left in the pot , the eldest one said : ` Listen carefully to what I have to tell you ."
"After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper , he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him ."
"You can hear him snoring a mile off , and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him , and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot ."
I do n't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person 's mind .
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you , and your own map can become intensely interesting , but catch them trying to draw a map of a child 's mind , which is not only confused , but keeps going round all the time ."
"There are zigzag lines on it , just like your temperature on a card , and these are probably roads in the island ; for the Neverland is always more or less an island , with astonishing splashes of colour here and there , and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing , and savages and lonely lairs , and gnomes who are mostly tailors , and caves through which a river runs , and princes with six elder brothers , and a hut fast going to decay , and one very small old lady with a hooked nose ."
"It would be an easy map if that were all ; but there is also first day at school , religion , fathers , the round pond , needlework , murders , hangings , verbs that take the dative , chocolate pudding day , getting into braces , say ninety-nine , three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself , and so on ; and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through , and it is all rather confusing , especially as nothing will stand still ."
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal .
"John 's , for instance , had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting , while Michael , who was very small , had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it ."
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands , Michael in a wigwam , Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together ."
"John had no friends , Michael had friends at night , Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents ; but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance , and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other 's nose , and so forth ."
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles .
"We too have been there ; we can still hear the sound of the surf , though we shall land no more ."
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact ; not large and sprawly , you know , with tedious distances between one adventure and another , but nicely crammed ."
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth , it is not in the least alarming , but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very nearly real ."
That is why there are night-lights .
"Occasionally in her travels through her children 's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand , and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter ."
"She knew of no Peter , and yet he was here and there in John and Michael 's minds , while Wendy 's began to be scrawled all over with him ."
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words , and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance ."
"` Yes , he is rather cocky , ' Wendy admitted with regret ."
Her mother had been questioning her .
"` But who is he , my pet ? '"
"` He is Peter Pan , you know , mother . '"
"At first Mrs. Darling did not know , but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies ."
"There were odd stories about him ; as that when children died he went part of the way with them , so that they should not be frightened ."
"She had believed in him at the time , but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person ."
"` Besides , ' she said to Wendy , ` he would be grown up by this time . '"
"` Oh no , he is n't grown up , ' Wendy assured her confidently , ` and he is just my size . '"
"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body ; she did n't know how she knew it , she just knew it ."
"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling , but he smiled pooh-pooh ."
"` Mark my words , ' he said , ` it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads ; just the sort of idea a dog would have ."
"Leave it alone , and it will blow over . '"
But it would not blow over ; and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock .
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them .
"For instance , they may remember to mention , a week after the event happened , that when they were in the wood they met their dead father and had a game with him ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
` Preposterous ! '
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a plaything ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
-LSB- Illustration : ` Preposterous ! '
cried Solomon in a rage -RSB- Nor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow 's good-will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by and by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper , and a boot-lace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , ` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , ' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"` Consider , ' he said at last , ` how warm the mud makes the nest . '"
"` Consider , ' cried Mrs. Finch , ` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . '"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"` Try another drink , ' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : For years he had been quietly filling his stocking -RSB- Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"` If , ' said he , ' a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . '"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol ."
"John Trelawney Postscript -- I did not tell you that Blandly , who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we do n't turn up by the end of August , had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respects a treasure ."
"Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named Arrow ."
"I have a boatswain who pipes , Livesey ; so things shall go man-o ' - war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA ."
"I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker 's account , which has never been overdrawn ."
"He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving ."
J. T. P.P.S. -- Hawkins may stay one night with his mother .
J. T .
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me .
"I was half beside myself with glee ; and if ever I despised a man , it was old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament ."
"Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure was like law among them all ."
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble .
"The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits ."
"The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling ."
"The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar ."
He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone .
"It was on seeing that boy that I understood , for the first time , my situation ."
"I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that I was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , I had my first attack of tears ."
"I am afraid I led that boy a dog 's life , for as he was new to the work , I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and I was not slow to profit by them ."
"The night passed , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road ."
"I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted , no longer quite so dear ."
"One of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope ."
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight .
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath .
"I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time ."
`` Where are we ? ''
I asked .
"`` Bristol , '' said Tom ."
`` Get down . ''
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner .
"Thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations ."
"In one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider 's ."
"He too sprang high and well , but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat ."
"Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk , but Andras only laughed and said carelessly : ` Just a little too short , bailiff ; next time you must do better than that . '"
"The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival 's scornful words , and answered quickly : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"And turning his back on his friends , he went sulkily home ."
"Andras , putting the money he had earned in his pocket , went home also ."
The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso .
"A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off ; and the bailiff , disguising himself as a Stalo , or ogre , called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras ."
"Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands , thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump ."
"He wandered on , his eyes fixed on the sands , so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock , while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves ."
"A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself , and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage ."
` Dear me !
"I may find some use for that , ' he said ; and hastened down to the sea , waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him ."
"Suddenly -- he could not have told why -- a nameless fear seized upon him , and he fled away from the shore as if for his life ."
"As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe , such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use ; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen , but the bailiff himself ."
"It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain , where the sun never set , and it was very difficult to get to sleep , Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic , and this stood him in good stead now ."
"The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer , and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles ."
Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing .
"Nothing he could see , but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain , and ever , as he listened , it drew nearer ."
"A cold shiver shook Andras , and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf ."
For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him .
A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living .
"Yes ; but not so swift as a Stalo , as Andras found out when he stopped to rest , and heard the pipe playing !"
"For a moment his heart sank , and he gave himself up for dead , till he remembered that , not far off , were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river ."
"In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water , except in dry seasons , and as the winter rains had been very heavy , he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen ."
"The next minute , if anyone had been looking that way , he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards , and by-and-by giving a great spring , which landed him in the midst of the stream ."
"But , instead of sinking to the bottom , he paused a second to steady himself , then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore ."
"He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly , so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was ."
` Ah !
"There you are , ' cried the Stalo , appearing on the opposite bank ; ` for a moment I really thought I had lost you . '"
"` No such luck , ' answered Andras , shaking his head sorrowfully ."
By this time he had taken his own shape again .
"There was something he wanted very much , but , though he knew he wanted it , he could not think what it was ."
"What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose , but that never struck him , so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment ."
They are reputed to know a good deal .
"There were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk , with their arms round each other 's waists , and he hopped down to address them ."
"The fairies have their tiffs with the birds , but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question , and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him ."
"Another was lolling on a garden-chair , reading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall , and when he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip ."
To Peter 's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him .
"A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them ."
A milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it .
Soon the Gardens were in an uproar .
"Crowds of fairies were running this way and that , asking each other stoutly , who was afraid , lights were extinguished , doors barricaded , and from the grounds of Queen Mab 's palace came the rubadub of drums , showing that the royal guard had been called out ."
"A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk , armed with holly-leaves , with which they jog the enemy horribly in passing ."
"Peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time , but he never thought for a moment that he was the human ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though that had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
"Poor little Peter Pan , he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease forever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"`` Look at your night-gown , if you do n't believe me , '' Solomon said , and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
`` How many of your toes are thumbs ? ''
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"`` Ruffle your feathers , '' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window-ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"`` I think I shall go back to mother , '' he said timidly ."
"`` Good-bye , '' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
"There was no sign of the brig , which must have lifted from the reef and sunk ."
"The boat , too , was nowhere to be seen ."
There was never a sail upon the ocean ; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man .
"I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates , and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene ."
"What with my wet clothes and weariness , and my belly that now began to ache with hunger , I had enough to trouble me without that ."
"So I set off eastward along the south coast , hoping to find a house where I might warm myself , and perhaps get news of those I had lost ."
"And at the worst , I considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes ."
"After a little , my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea , which seemed to run pretty deep into the land ; and as I had no means to get across , I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it ."
"It was still the roughest kind of walking ; indeed the whole , not only of Earraid , but of the neighbouring part of Mull -LRB- which they call the Ross -RRB- is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among ."
At first the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see ; but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again .
"At this I scratched my head , but had still no notion of the truth : until at last I came to a rising ground , and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a little barren isle , and cut off on every side by the salt seas ."
"Instead of the sun rising to dry me , it came on to rain , with a thick mist ; so that my case was lamentable ."
"I stood in the rain , and shivered , and wondered what to do , till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable ."
Back I went to the narrowest point and waded in .
"But not three yards from shore , I plumped in head over ears ; and if ever I was heard of more , it was rather by God 's grace than my own prudence ."
"I was no wetter -LRB- for that could hardly be -RRB- , but I was all the colder for this mishap ; and having lost another hope was the more unhappy ."
"And now , all at once , the yard came in my head ."
What had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety .
"With that I set off , undaunted , across the top of the isle , to fetch and carry it back ."
"It was a weary tramp in all ways , and if hope had not buoyed me up , I must have cast myself down and given up ."
"Whether with the sea salt , or because I was growing fevered , I was distressed with thirst , and had to stop , as I went , and drink the peaty water out of the hags ."
"I came to the bay at last , more dead than alive ; and at the first glance , I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left it ."
"In I went , for the third time , into the sea ."
"The sand was smooth and firm , and shelved gradually down , so that I could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face ."
"But at that depth my feet began to leave me , and I durst venture in no farther ."
"As for the yard , I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond ."
"I had borne up well until this last disappointment ; but at that I came ashore , and flung myself down upon the sands and wept ."
"The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me , that I must pass it lightly over ."
"In all the books I have read of people cast away , they had either their pockets full of tools , or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them , as if on purpose ."
My case was very different .
"I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan 's silver button ; and being inland bred , I was as much short of knowledge as of means ."
"I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat ; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets , which at first I could scarcely strike from their places , not knowing quickness to be needful ."
"`` In honour , I do , '' said Dick ."
"`` Hear , then , '' she continued ; `` Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband ."
"Nay , now , no words ! ''"
cried she .
`` They will avail you nothing .
"For see how just it is , that you who deprived me of one home , should supply me with another ."
"And as for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , as we be dear friends , what matters it with which of us ye wed ?"
Not one whit ! ''
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to wed with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for man 's force nor yet for lady 's pleasure ."
"Pardon me if I speak my plain thoughts plainly ; but where a maid is very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . ''"
"`` Dick , '' she said , `` ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word ."
"Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I stole it ."
"And as for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye were not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it was not you that set him there ."
"But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y ' are all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . ''"
"CHAPTER VI -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS -LRB- concluded -RRB- : DICK AND JOAN The horses had by this time finished the small store of provender , and fully breathed from their fatigues ."
"At Dick 's command , the fire was smothered in snow ; and while his men got once more wearily to saddle , he himself , remembering , somewhat late , true woodland caution , chose a tall oak and nimbly clambered to the topmost fork ."
Hence he could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest .
"On the south-west , dark against the horizon , stood those upland , heathy quarters where he and Joanna had met with the terrifying misadventure of the leper ."
And there his eye was caught by a spot of ruddy brightness no bigger than a needle 's eye .
He blamed himself sharply for his previous neglect .
"Were that , as it appeared to be , the shining of Sir Daniel 's camp-fire , he should long ago have seen and marched for it ; above all , he should , for no consideration , have announced his neighbourhood by lighting a fire of his own ."
But now he must no longer squander valuable hours .
"The direct way to the uplands was about two miles in length ; but it was crossed by a very deep , precipitous dingle , impassable to mounted men ; and for the sake of speed , it seemed to Dick advisable to desert the horses and attempt the adventure on foot ."
"Ten men were left to guard the horses ; signals were agreed upon by which they could communicate in case of need ; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder , Alicia Risingham walking stoutly by his side ."
"The men had freed themselves of heavy armour , and left behind their lances ; and they now marched with a very good spirit in the frozen snow , and under the exhilarating lustre of the moon ."
"The descent into the dingle , where a stream strained sobbing through the snow and ice , was effected with silence and order ; and on the further side , being then within a short half mile of where Dick had seen the glimmer of the fire , the party halted to breathe before the attack ."
"In the vast silence of the wood , the lightest sounds were audible from far ; and Alicia , who was keen of hearing , held up her finger warningly and stooped to listen ."
"All followed her example ; but besides the groans of the choked brook in the dingle close behind , and the barking of a fox at a distance of many miles among the forest , to Dick 's acutest hearkening , not a breath was audible ."
"`` But yet , for sure , I heard the clash of harness , '' whispered Alicia ."
"`` Madam , '' returned Dick , who was more afraid of that young lady than of ten stout warriors , `` I would not hint ye were mistaken ; but it might well have come from either of the camps . ''"
`` It came not thence .
"It came from westward , '' she declared ."
"asked sly Mrs. Jo , popping the sweeties into her little spool-bag ."
"`` Yes , '' said Stuffy , with a sigh ; and pocketing the forbidden fruit , he went away to give Bess the present , that won a smile from her , and permission to escort her round the garden ."
"`` Poor Stuffy 's heart has really got the better of his stomach at last , and his efforts will be much encouraged by the rewards Bess gives him , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
`` Happy is the man who can put temptation in his pocket and learn self-denial from so sweet a little teacher ! ''
"added Mr. Bhaer , as the children passed the window , Stuffy 's fat face full of placid satisfaction , and Goldilocks surveying her sugar-rose with polite interest , though she would have preferred a real flower with a `` pitty smell . ''"
"When her father came to take her home , a universal wail arose , and the parting gifts showered upon her increased her luggage to such an extent that Mr. Laurie proposed having out the big wagon to take it into town ."
"Every one had given her something ; and it was found difficult to pack white mice , cake , a parcel of shells , apples , a rabbit kicking violently in a bag , a large cabbage for his refreshment , a bottle of minnows , and a mammoth bouquet ."
"The farewell scene was moving , for the Princess sat upon the hall-table , surrounded by her subjects ."
"She kissed her cousins , and held out her hand to the other boys , who shook it gently with various soft speeches , for they were taught not to be ashamed of showing their emotions ."
"`` Come again soon , little dear , '' whispered Dan , fastening his best green-and-gold beetle in her hat ."
"`` Do n't forget me , Princess , whatever you do , '' said the engaging Tommy , taking a last stroke of the pretty hair ."
"`` I am coming to your house next week , and then I shall see you , Bess , '' added Nat , as if he found consolation in the thought ."
"`` Do shake hands now , '' cried Jack , offering a smooth paw ."
"`` Here are two nice new ones to remember us by , '' said Dick and Dolly , presenting fresh whistles , quite unconscious that seven old ones had been privately deposited in the kitchen-stove ."
`` My little precious !
"I shall work you a book-mark right away , and you must keep it always , '' said Nan , with a warm embrace ."
"But of all the farewells , poor Billy 's was the most pathetic , for the thought that she was really going became so unbearable that he cast himself down before her , hugging her little blue boots and blubbering despairingly , `` Do n't go away !"
"oh , do n't ! ''"
"Goldilocks was so touched by this burst of feeling , that she leaned over and lifting the poor lad 's head , said , in her soft , little voice , `` Do n't cry , poor Billy !"
I will tiss you and tum adain soon . ''
"This promise consoled Billy , and he fell back beaming with pride at the unusual honor conferred upon him ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"clamored Dick and Dolly , feeling that their devotion deserved some return ."
"The others looked as if they would like to join in the cry ; and something in the kind , merry faces about her moved the Princess to stretch out her arms and say , with reckless condescension , `` I will tiss evvybody ! ''"
"Like a swarm of bees about a very sweet flower , the affectionate lads surrounded their pretty playmate , and kissed her till she looked like a little rose , not roughly , but so enthusiastically that nothing but the crown of her hat was visible for a moment ."
"Then her father rescued her , and she drove away still smiling and waving her hands , while the boys sat on the fence screaming like a flock of guinea-fowls , `` Come back !"
come back ! ''
till she was out of sight .
"They all missed her , and each dimly felt that he was better for having known a creature so lovely , delicate , and sweet ; for little Bess appealed to the chivalrous instinct in them as something to love , admire , and protect with a tender sort of reverence ."
"Many a man remembers some pretty child who has made a place in his heart and kept her memory alive by the simple magic of her innocence ; these little men were just learning to feel this power , and to love it for its gentle influence , not ashamed to let the small hand lead them , nor to own their loyalty to womankind , even in the bud ."
CHAPTER XIV .
"But there was one recess in the wall , no larger than a bird-cage , which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell ."
"It could be shut off from the rest of the home by a tiny curtain , which Tink , who was most fastidious , always kept drawn when dressing or undressing ."
"No woman , however large , could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined ."
"The couch , as she always called it , was a genuine Queen Mab , with club legs ; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season ."
"Her mirror was a Puss-in-boots , of which there are now only three , unchipped , known to the fairy dealers ; the wash-stand was Pie-crust and reversible , the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth , and the carpet and rugs of the best -LRB- the early -RRB- period of Margery and Robin ."
"There was a chandelier from Tiddly winks for the look of the thing , but of course she lit the residence herself ."
"Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house , as indeed was perhaps inevitable ; and her chamber , though beautiful , looked rather conceited , having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up ."
"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy , because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do ."
"Really there were whole weeks when , except perhaps with a stocking in the evening , she was never above ground ."
"The cooking , I can tell you , kept her nose to the pot ."
"Their chief food was roasted breadfruit , yams , cocoa-nuts , baked pig , mammee-apples , tappa rolls and bananas , washed down with calabashes of poe-poe ; but you never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe , it all depended upon Peter 's whim ."
"He could eat , really eat , if it was part of a game , but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy , which is what most children like better than anything else ; the next best thing being to talk about it ."
Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder .
"Of course it was trying , but you simply had to follow his lead , and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge ."
Wendy 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed .
"Then , as she expressed it , she had a breathing time for herself ; and she occupied it in making new things for them , and putting double pieces on the knees , for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees ."
"At this high-handed proceeding , and the threat which accompanied it , Jack 's patience gave out , and catching up Caesar , as he thought , sent him flying after the retreating tyrant with the defiant declaration , -- `` Keep them , then , and your old book , too !"
I wo n't look at it till you give all my stamps back and say you are sorry .
So now ! ''
"It was all over before Mamma could interfere , or Jill do more than clutch and cling to the gum-brush ."
"Frank vanished unharmed , but the poor book dashed against the wall to fall half open on the floor , its gay cover loosened , and its smooth leaves crushed by the blow ."
`` It 's the album !
"O Jack , how could you ? ''"
"cried Jill , dismayed at sight of the precious book so maltreated by the owner ."
`` Thought it was the other .
Guess it is n't hurt much .
"Did n't mean to hit him , any way ."
"He does provoke me so , '' muttered Jack , very red and shamefaced as his mother picked up the book and laid it silently on the table before him ."
"He did not know what to do with himself , and was thankful for the stamps still left him , finding great relief in making faces as he plucked them one by one from his mortified countenance ."
"Jill looked on , half glad , half sorry that her savage showed such signs of unconverted ferocity , and Mrs. Minot went on writing letters , wearing the grave look her sons found harder to bear than another person 's scolding ."
"No one spoke for a moment , and the silence was becoming awkward when Gus appeared in a rubber suit , bringing a book to Jack from Laura and a note to Jill from Lotty ."
"`` Look here , you just trundle me into my den , please , I 'm going to have a nap , it 's so dull to-day I do n't feel like doing much , '' said Jack , when Gus had done his errands , trying to look as if he knew nothing about the fracas ."
Aunt Susanna came down the next day and told Margaret that she would send her to college .
Also she commissioned Laura to paint her a water-color for her dining-room and said she 'd pay her five dollars for it .
"Kate and I were rather left out in the cold in this distribution of favors , but when you come to reflect that Laura and Magsie had really cooked that dinner , it was only just ."
"Anyway , Aunt Susanna has never since insinuated that we ca n't cook , and that is as much as we deserve ."
By Grace of Julius Caesar Melissa sent word on Monday evening that she thought we had better go round with the subscription list for cushioning the church pews on Tuesday .
I sent back word that I thought we had better go on Thursday .
"I had no particular objection to Tuesday , but Melissa is rather fond of settling things without consulting anyone else , and I do n't believe in always letting her have her own way ."
"Melissa is my cousin and we have always been good friends , and I am really very fond of her ; but there 's no sense in lying down and letting yourself be walked over ."
We finally compromised on Wednesday .
"I always have a feeling of dread when I hear of any new church-project for which money will be needed , because I know perfectly well that Melissa and I will be sent round to collect for it ."
"People say we seem to be able to get more than anybody else ; and they appear to think that because Melissa is an unencumbered old maid , and I am an unencumbered widow , we can spare the time without any inconvenience to ourselves ."
"Well , we have been canvassing for building funds , and socials , and suppers for years , but it is needed now ; at least , I have had enough of it , and I should think Melissa has , too ."
"We started out bright and early on Wednesday morning , for Jersey Cove is a big place and we knew we should need the whole day ."
"We had to walk because neither of us owned a horse , and anyway it 's more nuisance getting out to open and shut gates than it is worth while ."
"It was a lovely day then , though promising to be hot , and our hearts were as light as could be expected , considering the disagreeable expedition we were on ."
"I was waiting at my gate for Melissa when she came , and she looked me over with wonder and disapproval ."
I could see she thought I was a fool to dress up in my second best flowered muslin and my very best hat with the pale pink roses in it to walk about in the heat and dust ; but I was n't .
"All my experience in canvassing goes to show that the better dressed and better looking you are the more money you 'll get -- that is , when it 's the men you have to tackle , as in this case ."
"If it had been the women , however , I would have put on the oldest and ugliest things , consistent with decency , I had ."
"This was what Melissa had done , as it was , and she did look fearfully prim and dowdy , except for her front hair , which was as soft and fluffy and elaborate as usual ."
I never could understand how Melissa always got it arranged so beautifully .
Nothing particular happened the first part of the day .
"Some few growled and would n't subscribe anything , but on the whole we did pretty well ."
"If it had been a missionary subscription we should have fared worse ; but when it was something touching their own comfort , like cushioning the pews , they came down handsomely ."
"We reached Daniel Wilson 's by noon , and had to have dinner there ."
"We did n't eat much , although we were hungry enough -- Mary Wilson 's cooking is a by-word in Jersey Cove ."
"No wonder Daniel is dyspeptic ; but dyspeptic or not , he gave us a big subscription for our cushions and told us we looked younger than ever ."
"Daniel is always very complimentary , and they say Mary is jealous ."
"When we left the Wilson 's Melissa said , with an air of a woman nerving herself to a disagreeable duty : `` I suppose we might as well go to Isaac Appleby 's now and get it over . ''"
I agreed with her .
I had been dreading that call all day .
It is n't a very pleasant thing to go to a man you have recently refused to marry and ask him for money ; and Melissa and I were both in that predicament .
"He , for his part , took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity ."
"`` For thirty years , '' he said , `` I 've sailed the seas and seen good and bad , better and worse , fair weather and foul , provisions running out , knives going , and what not ."
"Well , now I tell you , I never seen good come o ' goodness yet ."
"Him as strikes first is my fancy ; dead men do n't bite ; them 's my views -- amen , so be it ."
"And now , you look here , '' he added , suddenly changing his tone , `` we 've had about enough of this foolery ."
The tide 's made good enough by now .
"You just take my orders , Cap'n Hawkins , and we 'll sail slap in and be done with it . ''"
"All told , we had scarce two miles to run ; but the navigation was delicate , the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal , but lay east and west , so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in ."
"I think I was a good , prompt subaltern , and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot , for we went about and about and dodged in , shaving the banks , with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold ."
Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us .
"The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage , but the space was longer and narrower and more like , what in truth it was , the estuary of a river ."
"Right before us , at the southern end , we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation ."
"It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed , and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers ."
"It was a sad sight , but it showed us that the anchorage was calm ."
"`` Now , '' said Hands , `` look there ; there 's a pet bit for to beach a ship in ."
"Fine flat sand , never a cat 's paw , trees all around of it , and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship . ''"
"`` And once beached , '' I inquired , `` how shall we get her off again ? ''"
"`` Why , so , '' he replied : `` you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water , take a turn about one of them big pines ; bring it back , take a turn around the capstan , and lie to for the tide ."
"Come high water , all hands take a pull upon the line , and off she comes as sweet as natur ' ."
"And now , boy , you stand by ."
"We 're near the bit now , and she 's too much way on her ."
Starboard a little -- so -- steady -- starboard -- larboard a little -- steady -- steady ! ''
"So he issued his commands , which I breathlessly obeyed , till , all of a sudden , he cried , `` Now , my hearty , luff ! ''"
"And I put the helm hard up , and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low , wooded shore ."
"The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto , sharply enough , upon the coxswain ."
"Even then I was still so much interested , waiting for the ship to touch , that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows ."
I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head .
"Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye ; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat 's ; but , sure enough , when I looked round , there was Hands , already half-way towards me , with the dirk in his right hand ."
"We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully 's ."
"At the same instant , he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows ."
"As I did so , I let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and I think this saved my life , for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment , dead ."
"Before he could recover , I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped , with all the deck to dodge about ."
"`` Yes , it 's quite true ."
And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of duty and all that .
"But now , thank goodness , there is no need of such wholesale immolation ."
So just let 's forgive each other . ''
"`` Oh , '' sighed Edith happily , `` it is almost too good to be true . ''"
"`` It is really providentially ordered , is n't it ? ''"
said Katherine .
"`` Ned and I would never have got on together in the world , and you and Sidney would have bored each other to death ."
"As it is , there will be four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones ."
I 'll tell Ned so tomorrow . ''
Four Winds Alan Douglas threw down his pen with an impatient exclamation .
"It was high time his next Sunday 's sermon was written , but he could not concentrate his thoughts on his chosen text ."
"For one thing he did not like it and had selected it only because Elder Trewin , in his call of the evening before , had hinted that it was time for a good stiff doctrinal discourse , such as his predecessor in Rexton , the Rev. Jabez Strong , had delighted in ."
"Alan hated doctrines -- `` the soul 's staylaces , '' he called them -- but Elder Trewin was a man to be reckoned with and Alan preached an occasional sermon to please him ."
"`` It 's no use , '' he said wearily ."
"`` I could have written a sermon in keeping with that text in November or midwinter , but now , when the whole world is reawakening in a miracle of beauty and love , I ca n't do it ."
"If a northeast rainstorm does n't set in before next Sunday , Mr. Trewin will not have his sermon ."
"I shall take as my text instead , ` The flowers appear on the earth , the time of the singing of birds has come . ' ''"
"He rose and went to his study window , outside of which a young vine was glowing in soft tender green tints , its small dainty leaves casting quivering shadows on the opposite wall where the portrait of Alan 's mother hung ."
"She had a fine , strong , sweet face ; the same face , cast in a masculine mould , was repeated in her son , and the resemblance was striking as he stood in the searching evening sunshine ."
"The black hair grew around his forehead in the same way ; his eyes were steel blue , like hers , with a similar expression , half brooding , half tender , in their depths ."
"He had the mobile , smiling mouth of the picture , but his chin was deeper and squarer , dented with a dimple which , combined with a certain occasional whimsicality of opinion and glance , had caused Elder Trewin some qualms of doubt regarding the fitness of this young man for his high and holy vocation ."
"The Rev. Jabez Strong had never indulged in dimples or jokes ; but then , as Elder Trewin , being a just man , had to admit , the Rev. Jabez Strong had preached many a time and oft to more empty pews than full ones , while now the church was crowded to its utmost capacity on Sundays and people came to hear Mr. Douglas who had not darkened a church door for years ."
"All things considered , Elder Trewin decided to overlook the dimple ."
There was sure to be some drawback in every minister .
"Alan from his study looked down on all the length of the Rexton valley , at the head of which the manse was situated , and thought that Eden might have looked so in its innocence , for all the orchards were abloom and the distant hills were tremulous and aerial in springtime gauzes of pale purple and pearl ."
"But in any garden , despite its beauty , is an element of tameness and domesticity , and Alan 's eyes , after a moment 's delighted gazing , strayed wistfully off to the north where the hills broke away into a long sloping lowland of pine and fir ."
"Beyond it stretched the wide expanse of the lake , flashing in the molten gold and crimson of evening ."
Its lure was irresistible .
Alan had been born and bred beside a faraway sea and the love of it was strong in his heart -- so strong that he knew he must go back to it sometime .
"Meanwhile , the great lake , mimicking the sea in its vast expanse and the storms that often swept over it , was his comfort and solace ."
"As often as he could he stole away to its wild and lonely shore , leaving the snug bounds of cultivated home lands behind him with something like a sense of relief ."
Judging from her expression she was very well satisfied with herself .
"A pale little thing , with smooth ripples of fine , silky , fawn-colored hair flowing over her shoulders , must , Anne thought , be Annetta Bell , whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district , but , by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were now in Avonlea ."
"Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were certainly Cottons ; and there was no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel eyes , who was casting coquettish looks at Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament , was Prillie Rogerson , whose father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from her grandmother 's in Grafton ."
"A tall , awkward girl in a back seat , who seemed to have too many feet and hands , Anne could not place at all , but later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come to live with an Avonlea aunt ."
She was also to find that if Barbara ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody else 's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it .
"But when Anne 's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing her own , a queer little thrill went over her , as if she had found her genius ."
She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the Avonlea children .
"More than that , Anne realized that he was unlike other children anywhere , and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so intently ."
She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight .
"He had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child ... features of exquisite delicacy and refinement , framed in a halo of chestnut curls ."
"His mouth was delicious , being full without pouting , the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled ."
"He had a sober , grave , meditative expression , as if his spirit was much older than his body ; but when Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile , which seemed an illumination of his whole being , as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame inside of him , irradiating him from top to toe ."
"Best of all , it was involuntary , born of no external effort or motive , but simply the outflashing of a hidden personality , rare and fine and sweet ."
With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends forever before a word had passed between them .
The day went by like a dream .
Anne could never clearly recall it afterwards .
It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else .
She heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically .
The children behaved quite well ; only two cases of discipline occurred .
Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle .
Anne stood Morley on the platform for an hour and ... which Morley felt much more keenly ... confiscated his crickets .
"She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free in Violet Vale ; but Morley believed , then and ever afterwards , that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement ."
"The other culprit was Anthony Pye , who poured the last drops of water from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay 's neck ."
"Anne kept Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of gentlemen , admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies ' necks ."
"She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen , she said ."
Her little lecture was quite kind and touching ; but unfortunately Anthony remained absolutely untouched .
"He listened to her in silence , with the same sullen expression , and whistled scornfully as he went out ."
"Anne sighed ; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye 's affections , like the building of Rome , was n't the work of a day ."
"In fact , it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to win ; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony , who looked as if he might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness ."
When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily into her chair .
Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged .
"There was no real reason for discouragement , since nothing very dreadful had occurred ; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching ."
"Tommy and Demi were honorary members , but were always obliged to retire unpleasantly early , owing to circumstances over which they had no control ."
"The proceedings of this club were somewhat peculiar , for it met at all sorts of places and hours , had all manner of queer ceremonies and amusements , and now and then was broken up tempestuously , only to be re-established , however , on a firmer basis ."
"Rainy evenings the members met in the schoolroom , and passed the time in games : chess , morris , backgammon , fencing matches , recitations , debates , or dramatic performances of a darkly tragical nature ."
"In summer the barn was the rendezvous , and what went on there no uninitiated mortal knows ."
"On sultry evenings the Club adjourned to the brook for aquatic exercises , and the members sat about in airy attire , frog-like and cool ."
"On such occasions the speeches were unusually eloquent , quite flowing , as one might say ; and if any orator 's remarks displeased the audience , cold water was thrown upon him till his ardor was effectually quenched ."
"Franz was president , and maintained order admirably , considering the unruly nature of the members ."
"Mr. Bhaer never interfered with their affairs , and was rewarded for this wise forbearance by being invited now and then to behold the mysteries unveiled , which he appeared to enjoy much ."
"When Nan came she wished to join the Club , and caused great excitement and division among the gentlemen by presenting endless petitions , both written and spoken , disturbing their solemnities by insulting them through the key-hole , performing vigorous solos on the door , and writing up derisive remarks on walls and fences , for she belonged to the `` Irrepressibles . ''"
"Finding these appeals in vain , the girls , by the advice of Mrs. Jo , got up an institution of their own , which they called the Cosy Club ."
"To this they magnanimously invited the gentlemen whose youth excluded them from the other one , and entertained these favored beings so well with little suppers , new games devised by Nan , and other pleasing festivities , that , one by one , the elder boys confessed a desire to partake of these more elegant enjoyments , and , after much consultation , finally decided to propose an interchange of civilities ."
"The members of the Cosy Club were invited to adorn the rival establishment on certain evenings , and to the surprise of the gentlemen their presence was not found to be a restraint upon the conversation or amusement of the regular frequenters ; which could not be said of all Clubs , I fancy ."
"The ladies responded handsomely and hospitably to these overtures of peace , and both institutions flourished long and happily ."
CHAPTER IX .
"DAISY 'S BALL `` Mrs. Shakespeare Smith would like to have Mr. John Brooke , Mr. Thomas Bangs , and Mr. Nathaniel Blake to come to her ball at three o'clock today ."
"`` P.S. Nat must bring his fiddle , so we can dance , and all the boys must be good , or they can not have any of the nice things we have cooked . ''"
"This elegant invitation would , I fear , have been declined , but for the hint given in the last line of the postscript ."
"`` They have been cooking lots of goodies , I smelt 'em ."
"Let 's go , '' said Tommy ."
"`` We need n't stay after the feast , you know , '' added Demi ."
`` I never went to a ball .
What do you have to do ? ''
asked Nat .
"`` Oh , we just play be men , and sit round stiff and stupid like grown-up folks , and dance to please the girls ."
"Then we eat up everything , and come away as soon as we can . ''"
"`` I think I could do that , '' said Nat , after considering Tommy 's description for a minute ."
"`` I 'll write and say we 'll come ; '' and Demi despatched the following gentlemanly reply , `` We will all come ."
Please have lots to eat .
J. B. Esquire . ''
"Great was the anxiety of the ladies about their first ball , because if every thing went well they intended to give a dinner-party to the chosen few ."
"`` Aunt Jo likes to have the boys play with us , if they are not rough ; so we must make them like our balls , then they will do them good , '' said Daisy , with her maternal air , as she set the table and surveyed the store of refreshments with an anxious eye ."
"`` Demi and Nat will be good , but Tommy will do something bad , I know he will , '' replied Nan , shaking her head over the little cake-basket which she was arranging ."
"Dick had crossed the greater part of the open ground between Shoreby and the forest , and had reached the bottom of the little hill , some hundred yards below the Cross of St. Bride , when , through the stillness of the black morn , there rang forth the note of a trumpet , so shrill , clear , and piercing , that he thought he had never heard the match of it for audibility ."
"It was blown once , and then hurriedly a second time ; and then the clash of steel succeeded ."
"At this young Shelton pricked his ears , and drawing his sword , ran forward up the hill ."
"Presently he came in sight of the cross , and was aware of a most fierce encounter raging on the road before it ."
"There were seven or eight assailants , and but one to keep head against them ; but so active and dexterous was this one , so desperately did he charge and scatter his opponents , so deftly keep his footing on the ice , that already , before Dick could intervene , he had slain one , wounded another , and kept the whole in check ."
"Still , it was by a miracle that he continued his defence , and at any moment , any accident , the least slip of foot or error of hand , his life would be a forfeit ."
"`` Hold ye well , sir !"
Here is help ! ''
"cried Richard ; and forgetting that he was alone , and that the cry was somewhat irregular , `` To the Arrow !"
to the Arrow ! ''
"he shouted , as he fell upon the rear of the assailants ."
"These were stout fellows also , for they gave not an inch at this surprise , but faced about , and fell with astonishing fury upon Dick ."
"Four against one , the steel flashed about him in the starlight ; the sparks flew fiercely ; one of the men opposed to him fell -- in the stir of the fight he hardly knew why ; then he himself was struck across the head , and though the steel cap below his hood protected him , the blow beat him down upon one knee , with a brain whirling like a windmill sail ."
"Meanwhile the man whom he had come to rescue , instead of joining in the conflict , had , on the first sign of intervention , leaped aback and blown again , and yet more urgently and loudly , on that same shrill-voiced trumpet that began the alarm ."
"Next moment , indeed , his foes were on him , and he was once more charging and fleeing , leaping , stabbing , dropping to his knee , and using indifferently sword and dagger , foot and hand , with the same unshaken courage and feverish energy and speed ."
But that ear-piercing summons had been heard at last .
"There was a muffled rushing in the snow ; and in a good hour for Dick , who saw the sword-points glitter already at his throat , there poured forth out of the wood upon both sides a disorderly torrent of mounted men-at-arms , each cased in iron , and with visor lowered , each bearing his lance in rest , or his sword bared and raised , and each carrying , so to speak , a passenger , in the shape of an archer or page , who leaped one after another from their perches , and had presently doubled the array ."
"The original assailants ; seeing themselves outnumbered and surrounded , threw down their arms without a word ."
`` Seize me these fellows ! ''
"said the hero of the trumpet ; and when his order had been obeyed , he drew near to Dick and looked him in the face ."
"Dick , returning this scrutiny , was surprised to find in one who had displayed such strength , skill and energy , a lad no older than himself -- slightly deformed , with one shoulder higher than the other , and of a pale , painful , and distorted countenance ."
"-LCB- 2 -RCB- The eyes , however , were very clear and bold ."
"`` Sir , '' said this lad , `` ye came in good time for me , and none too early . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , with a faint sense that he was in the presence of a great personage , `` ye are yourself so marvellous a good swordsman that I believe ye had managed them single-handed ."
"Howbeit , it was certainly well for me that your men delayed no longer than they did . ''"
`` How knew ye who I was ? ''
demanded the stranger .
"`` Even now , my lord , '' Dick answered , `` I am ignorant of whom I speak with . ''"
`` Is it so ? ''
asked the other .
`` And yet ye threw yourself head first into this unequal battle . ''
"`` I saw one man valiantly contending against many , '' replied Dick , `` and I had thought myself dishonoured not to bear him aid . ''"
"Frank was considered a remarkably well-bred and proper lad , and rather prided himself on his good reputation , for he never got into scrapes like the other fellows ."
"Well , hardly ever , for we must confess that at rare intervals his besetting sin overcame his prudence , and he proved himself an erring , human boy ."
"Steam-engines had been his idols for years , and they alone could lure him from the path of virtue ."
"Once , in trying to investigate the mechanism of a toy specimen , which had its little boiler and ran about whistling and puffing in the most delightful way , he nearly set the house afire by the sparks that dropped on the straw carpet ."
"Another time , in trying experiments with the kitchen tea-kettle , he blew himself up , and the scars of that explosion he still carried on his hands ."
"He was long past such childish amusements now , but his favorite haunt was the engine-house of the new railroad , where he observed the habits of his pets with never-failing interest , and cultivated the good-will of stokers and brakemen till they allowed him many liberties , and were rather flattered by the admiration expressed for their iron horses by a young gentleman who liked them better even than his Greek and Latin ."
"There was not much business doing on this road as yet , and the two cars of the passenger-trains were often nearly empty , though full freight-trains rolled from the factory to the main road , of which this was only a branch ."
"So things went on in a leisurely manner , which gave Frank many opportunities of pursuing his favorite pastime ."
"He soon knew all about No. 11 , his pet engine , and had several rides on it with Bill , the engineer , so that he felt at home there , and privately resolved that when he was a rich man he would have a road of his own , and run trains as often as he liked ."
"Gus took less interest than his friend in the study of steam , but usually accompanied him when he went over after school to disport himself in the engine-house , interview the stoker , or see if there was anything new in the way of brakes ."
"One afternoon they found No. 11 on the side-track , puffing away as if enjoying a quiet smoke before starting ."
"No cars were attached , and no driver was to be seen , for Bill was off with the other men behind the station-house , helping the expressman , whose horse had backed down a bank and upset the wagon ."
"`` Good chance for a look at the old lady , '' said Frank , speaking of the engine as Bill did , and jumping aboard with great satisfaction , followed by Gus ."
"`` I 'd give ten dollars if I could run her up to the bend and back , '' he added , fondly touching the bright brass knobs and glancing at the fire with a critical eye ."
"`` You could n't do it alone , '' answered Gus , sitting down on the grimy little perch , willing to indulge his mate 's amiable weakness ."
`` Give me leave to try ?
"Steam is up , and I could do it as easy as not ; '' and Frank put his hand on the throttle-valve , as if daring Gus to give the word ."
`` Fire up and make her hum ! ''
"laughed Gus , quoting Bill 's frequent order to his mate , but with no idea of being obeyed ."
`` All right ; I 'll just roll her up to the switch and back again .
"I 've often done it with Bill ; '' and Frank cautiously opened the throttle-valve , threw back the lever , and the great thing moved with a throb and a puff ."
"`` Steady , old fellow , or you 'll come to grief ."
"Here , do n't open that ! ''"
"shouted Gus , for just at that moment Joe appeared at the switch , looking ready for mischief ."
"`` Wish he would ; no train for twenty minutes , and we could run up to the bend as well as not , '' said Frank , getting excited with the sense of power , as the monster obeyed his hand so entirely that it was impossible to resist prolonging the delight ."
"`` By George , he has !"
Stop her !
Back her !
"Hold on , Frank ! ''"
"cried Gus , as Joe , only catching the words `` Open that ! ''"
"obeyed , without the least idea that they would dare to leave the siding ."
"But they did , for Frank rather lost his head for a minute , and out upon the main track rolled No. 11 as quietly as a well-trained horse taking a familiar road ."
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered, “I am fishing.” The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said, “It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.” The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own."
"They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen."
"When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, “Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant’s hut.” One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, “Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,” and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, “Good God! where am I?” He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, “My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.” Tears rose to the King’s eyes and he said, “Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,” and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living."
95 Old Hildebrand
"Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, “Listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. I’ll tell you what; on Wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and if you only complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately.”"
"“I will manage it,” said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said, “I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear the parson’s sermon that he is going to preach to-day.” On that the peasant said, “Ah, my child, do not do it—thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look, I will go to the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell thee everything the parson says.”"
"“Well,” said the woman, “go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that thou hearest.” So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer."
"Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, “Hurrah! dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well! The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster,” and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly."
"But now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs. “May you be blessed,” said the gossip, “where are you off to so fast?”"
"“To all eternity, my friend,” said the peasant, “my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson’s sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage.” “But listen, gossip,” said the egg-merchant to the peasant, “are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that? Don’t you know what it means? The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.”"
“My word!” said the peasant. “How I’d like to know if that’s true!”
"“Come, then,” said the gossip, “I’ll tell you what to do. Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself.” So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home."
"When they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there. “It is I, gossip,” said the egg-merchant, “give me shelter this night; I have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it, for it is dark already.”"
"“Indeed, my friend,” said the woman, “thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me, but as thou art here it can’t be helped, come in, and take a seat there on the bench by the stove.” Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said, “Listen, my dear friend, thou canst sing beautifully; sing something to me.” “Oh,” said the woman, “I cannot sing now, in my young days indeed I could sing well enough, but that’s all over now.”"
"“Come,” said the parson once more, “do sing some little song.”"
"On that the woman began and sang,"
“I’ve sent my husband away from me To the Göckerli hill in Italy.”
"Thereupon the parson sang,"
"“I wish ’twas a year before he came back, I’d never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.”"
Hallelujah.
"Then the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,"
"“What art thou doing, my Hildebrand dear, There on the bench by the stove so near?”"
Hallelujah.
"And then the peasant sang from his basket,"
"“All singing I ever shall hate from this day, And here in this basket no longer I’ll stay.”"
Hallelujah.
"And he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house."
96 The Three Little Birds
"About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, “If I do not get that one, I will have none.” Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King’s right hand, “Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.”"
"These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said, “Yes,” and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax."
"But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, “We are quarrelling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other. The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to thee.” “How can you dispute about an old cap?” said the youth. “Thou dost not know what properties it has! It is a wishing-cap; whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there.” “Give me the cap,” said the youth, “I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.” He put it on and went away, and thought of the King’s daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward. At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, “Ah, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,” and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle."
"He entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the King’s daughter. But how shocked he was when he saw her. She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. “Are you the King’s daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?” cried he."
"“Ah,” she answered, “this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.” She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, “How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.” She said, “He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,” she added, “so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.”"
"“Nothing can keep me from doing it,” said he, “but tell me what I must do.” “Thou shalt know everything,” said the King’s daughter; “when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.”"
"The youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him. After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal’s body, and it fell down. Instantly a fiery bird arose from it, and was about to fly away, but the young man’s brother, the eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down, hunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in its extremity, it let the egg fall. The egg did not, however, fall into the sea, but on a fisherman’s hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house, they streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire. The other brother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the water up on high. When the fire was extinguished, the youth sought for the egg and happily found it; it was not yet melted, but the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the water, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt."
"When the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him, the latter said, “My power is destroyed, and from this time forth thou art the King of the Castle of the Golden Sun. With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form.” Then the youth hastened to the King’s daughter, and when he entered the room, she was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other."
198 Maid Maleen
"There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful."
"As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.” Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.” Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls."
"What else could they do but lament and complain? Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.” She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out. The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible. When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants."
"They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles. When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them. At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions."
"The son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked."
"The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen. When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen thee. I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!” Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.” It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold. At last she said angrily, “If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life. I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.” Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.” The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.” He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"“What art thou saying?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” “Dost thou know Maid Maleen?” “No,” she answered, “how should I know her; I have only heard of her.” When they came to the church-door, she said once more,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked he. “Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way. When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom."
"When the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince’s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception. As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”"
“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”
"“If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,” said he."
"So she bethought herself, and said,"
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me.”"
"She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?” “I said nothing but,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"The bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard."
“But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?”
asked the King’s son. “To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”
"She again said,"
"“Nothing is wanting, not even a hair, Be sure the Devil himself is there.”"
"Then it was Jergli’s turn to speak,"
"“If it be not, it’s at least his mother, Or else it’s the Devil’s own step-brother.”"
"And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,"
"“Advance, Veitli, advance, advance, And I behind will hold the lance.”"
"Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,"
"“Tis Schulz’s place the first to be, No one deserves that honor but he.”"
"Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,"
"“Then let us boldly advance to the fight, And thus we shall show our valour and might.”"
"Hereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God’s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed “Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!” in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy."
"“Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there, The monster’s nothing but a hare!”"
"But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said “What? what?” in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, “Wade, wade through the water,” and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked “Wat, wat, wat.” The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, “Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?” So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again."
120 The Three Apprentices
"There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said, “What shall we do? We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate.” And that seemed best to the others also."
"They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were. “We are apprentices looking for work; Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate.” “There is no need for that,” said the man, “if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work; nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages!” One of them said, “If our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it.” “They will not,” replied the man, “I have no claim on you.” One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse’s foot and a man’s foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said, “Be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full.” As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer, “All three of us,” to every question; the second was to say, “For money,” and the third, “And quite right too!” They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied, “All three of us.” “Yes,” said the host, “that is what I mean.” The second said, “For money.” “Of course,” said the host. The third said, “And quite right too!”"
"“Certainly it is right,” said the host."
"Good meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, “All three of us,” the second said, “For money,”"
"and the third, “and quite right too!” “Indeed it is right,” said the host, “all three pay, and without money I can give nothing.” They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said, “These people must be mad.” “Yes, indeed they are,”"
"said the host, “they are not very wise.” So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but, “All three of us,” “For money,” and “And quite right too!” But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, “Sir host, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices who might steal it from me.” The host did as he was asked."
"As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said, “The three crazy apprentices have done this;” the lodgers confirmed it, and said, “It can have been no one else.” The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them, “Have you killed the merchant?” “All three of us,” said the first, “For money,” said the second; and the third added, “And quite right too!”"
"“There now, you hear,” said the host, “they confess it themselves.”"
"They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, “Bear it just one day longer, and do not play away your luck, not one hair of your head shall be hurt.”"
"The next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said, “Are you the murderers?” “All three of us.” “Why did you kill the merchant?”"
"“For money.” “You wicked wretches, you have no horror of your sins?”"
"“And quite right too!” “They have confessed, and are still stubborn,”"
"said the judge, “lead them to death instantly.” So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner’s men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman, “It is a pardon coming,” and “Pardon! pardon!” was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said, “You three are innocent; you may now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.” Then said the eldest, “We did not kill the merchant, the murderer is standing there in the circle,” and he pointed to the innkeeper. “In proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he has killed are still hanging.” Then the judge sent the executioner’s men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, “Now I have got the soul which I wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the rest of your lives.”"
121 The King’s Son Who Feared Nothing
"There was once a King’s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father’s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, “I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.” So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him. It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant’s playthings lying in the yard. These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man. After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it. The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins. “Little worm,” cried he, “why art thou playing with my balls? Who gave thee strength to do it?” The King’s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, “Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.” The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, “Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.” “What dost thou want with it?” said the King’s son. “I do not want the apple for myself,” answered the giant, “but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it. I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.” “I will soon find it,” said the King’s son, “and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.” The giant said, “Thou really believest it to be so easy! The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.” “They will be sure to let me in,” said the King’s son. “Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.” “That luck will be mine,” said the King’s son."
"Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden."
"The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep. Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden. There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches. He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple. The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins. When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master."
"The King’s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, “Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.” The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, “I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.” The giant said, “I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,” and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King’s son refused it. “Where the apple is, the ring must be also,” said the giant; “if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.”"
"They wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King’s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring. Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, “I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou. We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.” The King’s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river."
"But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear: ""How can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some new artifice."" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman, ""Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do you great honour to-day."" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of ""Froggie"" which his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out: ""This is a fine pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless self."" The people there, when they heard him say that, raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the object presented to him, and murmured, ""Ah! a great sage, he knows even about the frog!"" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world."
The Charmed Ring
"A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill."
"""Please do not kill the dog,"" pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Then and there, of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog, and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. ""Oh!"
"please do not kill it,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money."
"He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but others did not. ""Please do not kill the snake,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees."" Of course the people agreed, and were highly delighted."
What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went home.
"""You fool! You scamp!"" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. ""Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my house."""
"So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head, and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its tail on the other."
"One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, ""I am the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's preserver!"""
"""Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,"" said the young man."
"""Well said!"" continued the snake. ""Do you see yonder mountain? At the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's country. Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too. But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and spoon which you possess.' With these in your possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of the rarest and most delicious foods."""
"Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. ""O master!"""
"exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do."
"""What shall we do? Where shall we go?"""
"""Wait for me here,"" he replied. ""I am not going far. I shall not be long away."" On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to sight."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the dog to the cat."
"""We must remain here,"" replied the cat, ""as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food. I will go to the people's houses and get plenty of food for both of us."" And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till their master came again and joined them."
"The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja's right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness's gratitude to him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the top of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting for him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and pot and spoon."
"The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for several years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his father, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir. At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the beautiful woman for his son's wife."
"She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful princess and said, ""I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before, because I left the country just after your birth."" She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress thought to herself, ""I shall soon accomplish my errand."" When she had been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring, and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring, and he readily gave it to her."
"The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of death. ""Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,"" she said to him. ""The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm, whereby you may bring her before you."" The prince was almost mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her."
"Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only, just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. ""O master!"" they said, ""stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your wife and house."""
"""Go,"" said he, ""and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my wife, and I shall live."""
"So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken."
"""We may have some difficulty here,"" said the cat. ""Look, the king has taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go to the house and try to see her."" So the dog sat down, and the cat climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them."
"""But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?"" she asked."
"""Yes,"" replied the cat, ""if you can tell me where the charmed ring is."""
"""The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,"" she said."
"""All right,"" said the cat, ""I will recover it. If we once get it, everything is ours."" Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down."
"The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and pounced down on him. ""Oh! let me go, let me go,"" cried the terrified rat. ""Oh! let him go,"" squealed all the company. ""It is his wedding day."""
"""No, no,"" replied the cat. ""Not unless you do something for me."
"And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone. She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune. Beautiful dresses were hanging in the wardrobes, the chests were filled with gold or silver, or with pearls and jewels, and she never felt a desire that she was not able to gratify. And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world. Wooers presented themselves daily, but none pleased her. At length the son of the King came and he knew how to touch her heart, and she betrothed herself to him. In the garden of the castle was a lime-tree, under which they were one day sitting together, when he said to her, “I will go home and obtain my father’s consent to our marriage. I entreat thee to wait for me here under this lime-tree, I shall be back with thee in a few hours.” The maiden kissed him on his left cheek, and said, “Keep true to me, and never let any one else kiss thee on this cheek. I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest.”"
"The maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset, but he did not return. She sat three days from morning till evening, waiting for him, but in vain. As he still was not there by the fourth day, she said, “Some accident has assuredly befallen him. I will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have found him.” She packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered with bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with golden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief, and set out. She inquired everywhere for her betrothed, but no one had seen him; no one knew anything about him."
"Far and wide did she wander through the world, but she found him not."
"At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd, and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone."
"And now she lived as a herdswoman, guarded her herd, and was very sad and full of longing for her beloved one; she had a little calf which she taught to know her, and fed it out of her own hand, and when she said,"
"“Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side, And do not forget thy shepherd-maid, As the prince forgot his betrothed bride, Who waited for him ’neath the lime-tree’s shade.”"
"the little calf knelt down, and she stroked it."
"And when she had lived for a couple of years alone and full of grief, a report was spread over all the land that the King’s daughter was about to celebrate her marriage. The road to the town passed through the village where the maiden was living, and it came to pass that once when the maiden was driving out her herd, her bridegroom travelled by. He was sitting proudly on his horse, and never looked round, but when she saw him she recognized her beloved, and it was just as if a sharp knife had pierced her heart. “Alas!” said she, “I believed him true to me, but he has forgotten me.”"
"Next day he again came along the road. When he was near her she said to the little calf,"
"“Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side, And do not forget thy shepherd-maid, As the prince forgot his betrothed bride, Who waited for him ’neath the lime-tree’s shade.”"
"When he was aware of the voice, he looked down and reined in his horse."
"He looked into the herd’s face, and then put his hands before his eyes as if he were trying to remember something, but he soon rode onwards and was out of sight. “Alas!” said she, “he no longer knows me,” and her grief was ever greater."
"Soon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at the King’s court, and the whole country was invited to it."
"“Now will I try my last chance,” thought the maiden, and when evening came she went to the stone under which she had buried her treasures."
"She took out the dress with the golden suns, put it on, and adorned herself with the jewels. She let down her hair, which she had concealed under a handkerchief, and it fell down in long curls about her, and thus she went into the town, and in the darkness was observed by no one. When she entered the brightly-lighted hall, every one started back in amazement, but no one knew who she was. The King’s son went to meet her, but he did not recognize her. He led her out to dance, and was so enchanted with her beauty, that he thought no more of the other bride."
"When the feast was over, she vanished in the crowd, and hastened before daybreak to the village, where she once more put on her herd’s dress."
"Next evening she took out the dress with the silver moons, and put a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair. When she appeared at the festival, all eyes were turned upon her, but the King’s son hastened to meet her, and filled with love for her, danced with her alone, and no longer so much as glanced at anyone else. Before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening."
"When she appeared for the third time, she wore the star-dress which sparkled at every step she took, and her hair-ribbon and girdle were starred with jewels. The prince had already been waiting for her for a long time, and forced his way up to her. “Do but tell who thou art,”"
"said he, “I feel just as if I had already known thee a long time.”"
"“Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me?” Then she stepped up to him, and kissed him on his left cheek, and in a moment it was as if scales fell from his eyes, and he recognized the true bride. “Come,”"
"said he to her, “here I stay no longer,” gave her his hand, and led her down to the carriage. The horses hurried away to the magic castle as if the wind had been harnessed to the carriage. The illuminated windows already shone in the distance. When they drove past the lime-tree, countless glow-worms were swarming about it. It shook its branches, and sent forth their fragrance. On the steps flowers were blooming, and the room echoed with the song of strange birds, but in the hall the entire court was assembled, and the priest was waiting to marry the bridegroom to the true bride."
187 The Hare and the Hedgehog
"This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really is true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always, when relating it, to say complacently, “It must be true, my son, or else no one could tell it to you.” The story is as follows. One Sunday morning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom, the sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was blowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing in the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people were all going in their Sunday clothes to church, and all creatures were happy, and the hedgehog was happy too."
"The hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms akimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a little song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than the songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed Sunday morning."
"Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself, it suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and drying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field, and see how his turnips were going on. The turnips were, in fact, close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own. No sooner said than done. The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the path to the field. He had not gone very far from home, and was just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the field, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his cabbages. When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him a friendly good morning. But the hare, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return the hedgehog’s greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same time a very contemptuous manner, “How do you happen to be running about here in the field so early in the morning?” “I am taking a walk,” said the hedgehog. “A walk!” said the hare, with a smile. “It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose.” This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he can bear anything but an attack on his legs, just because they are crooked by nature. So now the hedgehog said to the hare, “You seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine.” “That is just what I do think,” said the hare."
"“That can be put to the test,” said the hedgehog. “I wager that if we run a race, I will outstrip you.” “That is ridiculous! You with your short legs!” said the hare, “but for my part I am willing, if you have such a monstrous fancy for it. What shall we wager?” “A golden louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy,” said the hedgehog. “Done,” said the hare. “Shake hands on it, and then we may as well come off at once.”"
"“Nay,” said the hedgehog, “there is no such great hurry! I am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little breakfast. In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place.”"
"Hereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied with this. On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, “The hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him. He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow, and he shall pay for what he has said.” So when the hedgehog reached home, he said to his wife, “Wife, dress thyself quickly, thou must go out to the field with me.”"
"“What is going on, then?” said his wife. “I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy. I am to run a race with him, and thou must be present.” “Good heavens, husband,” the wife now cried, “art thou not right in thy mind, hast thou completely lost thy wits? What can make thee want to run a race with the hare?” “Hold thy tongue, woman,” said the hedgehog, “that is my affair. Don’t begin to discuss things which are matters for men. Be off, dress thyself, and come with me.” What could the hedgehog’s wife do? She was forced to obey him, whether she liked it or not."
"So when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog said to his wife, “Now pay attention to what I am going to say. Look you, I will make the long field our race-course. The hare shall run in one furrow, and I in another, and we will begin to run from the top. Now all that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow, on the other side of thee, thou must cry out to him, ‘I am here already!’”"
"Then they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife her place, and then walked up the field. When he reached the top, the hare was already there. “Shall we start?” said the hare. “Certainly,” said the hedgehog. “Then both at once.” So saying, each placed himself in his own furrow. The hare counted, “Once, twice, thrice, and away!” and went off like a whirlwind down the field. The hedgehog, however, only ran about three paces, and then he stooped down in the furrow, and stayed quietly where he was. When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field, the hedgehog’s wife met him with the cry, “I am here already!” The hare was shocked and wondered not a little, he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him, for the hedgehog’s wife looked just like her husband. The hare, however, thought to himself, “That has not been done fairly,” and cried, “It must be run again, let us have it again.” And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so that he seemed to fly. But the hedgehog’s wife stayed quietly in her place. So when the hare reached the top of the field, the hedgehog himself cried out to him, “I am here already.” The hare, however, quite beside himself with anger, cried, “It must be run again, we must have it again.” “All right,” answered the hedgehog, “for my part we’ll run as often as you choose.” So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and the hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog or his wife said, “I am here already.”"
"At the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer reach the end. In the middle of the field he fell to the ground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on the spot. But the hedgehog took the louis-d’or which he had won and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow, and both went home together in great delight, and if they are not dead, they are living there still."
"Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful things there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing beside her little boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him. But she said, ""My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; I will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is grown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings of his father. Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you."""
"At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into a little black dog, and led her away; saying, ""Since you will not come with me of your own free will, I will make you."" So the poor Princess was dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or of letting her sisters know what had become of her. As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the servants said to him, ""Where did you get that pretty little dog?"" And he answered, ""One of the Princesses gave it to me as a present."" At hearing which they let him go without further questioning."
"Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their nephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much surprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then they questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the little black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every direction seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again, and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of their little nephew."
"Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one day, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did he hear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his father and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bring them home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were much alarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, ""We have lost our husbands, and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if you go away, what shall we do?"" But he replied, ""I pray you not to be discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my father and mother and uncles with me."" So he set out on his travels; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search."
"At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents, he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, and trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower; hard by which was a Malee's little house."
"As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the house and said, ""My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this dangerous place?"" He answered, ""I am a Raja's son, and I come in search of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked enchanter bewitched."""
"Then the Malee's wife said, ""This country and this palace belong to a great enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he can turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see here were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what they now are. Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwards came his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees; and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower lives a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there for twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him."""
"Then the little Prince thought, ""These must be my parents and my uncles. I have found what I seek at last."" So he told his story to the Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned; and she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himself lest the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone. To this the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree, and pretended that he was her daughter."
"One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his garden he saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her who she was. She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magician said, ""You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the tower."""
"The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went immediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise, and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for establishing some communication with his mother, if it were indeed she."
"Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a small gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on her little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was older his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able to wear it. The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-known treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust to her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as such a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her ever establishing communication with her friends), that though the supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day, the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time."
"At last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one was looking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna's feet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers. On recognising it, she at once believed the story her son told her of his long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by trying to rescue her. She told him that for twelve long years the Magician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry him, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release."
"Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, ""Do not fear, dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the Magician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my father and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now rather speak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing to marry him. Then endeavour to find out what his power consists in, and whether he is immortal, or can be put to death."""
"Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent for Punchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested."
"The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible."
"But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, after being enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by degrees. ""And do tell me,"" she said, ""are you quite immortal? Can death never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?"""
"""Why do you ask?"" said he."
"""Because,"" she replied, ""if I am to be your wife, I would fain know all about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, or if possible to avert it."""
"""It is true,"" he added, ""that I am not as others. Far, far away, hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrot depends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,"" he added, ""impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place."""
Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.
"The Prince, however, replied, ""Mother, unless I can get hold of that parrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not afraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in good humour still putting off your marriage with him on various pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here."""
"So saying, he went away."
"Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick jungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep."
"He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a large serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in the tree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The Prince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killed the serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air, and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for their young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, ""Dear boy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; whenever you are in need, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as for these little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants."""
"At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their wings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over the thick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water. It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All round the trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were such countless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped the strong-winged eaglets down jumped the Prince; in an instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little green parrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted again into the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasure gone, set up a wild and melancholy howl."
"Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the great tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, ""Take back your little ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in need of help, I will not fail to come to you."" He then continued his journey on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace, where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot."
"Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, ""My boy, where did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you."""
"But the Prince answered, ""Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a great pet of mine; I have had it many years."""
"Then the Magician said, ""If it is an old favourite, I can understand your not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?"""
"""Sir,"" replied the Prince, ""I will not sell my parrot."""
"Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, ""Anything, anything; name what price you will, and it shall be yours."" The Prince answered, ""Let the seven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated."""
"""It is done as you desire,"" said the Magician, ""only give me my parrot."" And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and his brothers resumed their natural shapes. ""Now, give me my parrot,"""
157 The Sparrow And His Four Children
"A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow’s nest. When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind. Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each. In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him. “Ah, my dear sons, what pain I have been in about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching; listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard. Little birds have to encounter great dangers!” And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself? “I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries got ripe.” “Ah, my son,” said the father, “tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.”"
"“Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax?” said the son. “Where hast thou seen that?” “In a merchant’s garden,” said the youngster. “Oh, my son, merchant folks are quick folks,” said the father. “If thou hast been among the children of the world, thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough, only see that thou usest it well, and do not be too confident.” After this he asked the next, “Where hast thou passed thy time?” “At court,” said the son."
"“Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place—there one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armour, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and hen-harriers; keep to the horses’ stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace.” “Yes, father,” said the son, “but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught fast.” “Where hast thou seen that?” said the old bird."
"“At court, among the stable-boys.” “Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys! If thou hast been to court and among the lords, and hast left no feathers there, thou hast learnt a fair amount, and wilt know very well how to go about the world, but look around thee and above thee, for the wolves devour the wisest dogs.” The father examined the third also:"
"“Where didst thou seek thy safety?” “I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.” “That is indeed dainty fare,” said the father, “but take care what thou art about and look carefully around, especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone, there is not much time to stay then.” “That is true,” said the son, “but what if any one should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket?” “Where hast thou seen that?” “Among the mountaineers, dear father; when they go out, they generally take little bits of ore with them.” “Mountain folks are working folks, and clever folks. If thou hast been among mountain lads, thou hast seen and learnt something, but when thou goest thither beware, for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy.” At length the father came to the youngest son: “Thou, my dear chirping nestling, wert always the silliest and weakest; stay with me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them. Keep with those of thine own kind, and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the house, and then thou wilt live long in peace.” “My dear father, he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well, and no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to God, who is the Creator and Preserver of all forest and village birds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will.” “Where hast thou learnt this?” The son answered, “When the great blast of wind tore me away from thee I came to a church, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached. The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through, and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds.”"
"“In sooth, my dear son, if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies, and criest unto God like the young ravens, and commendest thyself to the eternal Creator, all will be well with thee, and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.”"
"“He who to God commits his ways, In silence suffers, waits, and prays, Preserves his faith and conscience pure, He is of God’s protection sure.”"
158 The Story of Schlauraffen Land
"In the time of Schlauraffen I went there, and saw Rome and the Lateran hanging by a small silken thread, and a man without feet who outran a swift horse, and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge. There I saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two fleet hares, and a lime-tree that was very large, on which hot cakes were growing. There I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body, and sixty loads of salt. Have I not told enough lies? There I saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow, and a child of one year threw four millstones from Ratisbon to Treves, and from Treves to Strasburg, and a hawk swam over the Rhine, which he had a perfect right to do. There I heard some fishes begin to make such a disturbance with each other, that it resounded as far as heaven, and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep valley at the top of a high mountain, and these were strange things. There were two crows which were mowing a meadow, and I saw two gnats building a bridge, and two doves tore a wolf to pieces; two children brought forth two kids, and two frogs threshed corn together. There I saw two mice consecrating a bishop, and two cats scratching out a bear’s tongue. Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions. There stood a barber and shaved a woman’s beard off; and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue. There I saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the water; and a sorry old horse was beside it, and said it was right. And four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn with all their might, and two goats were heating the stove, and a red cow shot the bread into the oven."
"Then a cock crowed, Cock-a-doodle-doo! The story is all told,—Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
159 The Ditmarsch Tale of Wonders
"I will tell you something. I saw two roasted fowls flying; they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the Rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at Whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare. Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts; one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step. Do you want to know how it was done?"
"First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck."
"There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields. Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned. A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there. In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here. Open the window, that the lies may fly out."
160 A Riddling Tale
"Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband, “If thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee.” And he did so. Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference? Answer: as she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her."
161 Snow-White and Rose-Red
"There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do."
"The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will not leave each other,” Rose-red answered, “Never so long as we live,” and their mother would add, “What one has she must share with the other.”"
"They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew."
"No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account."
"Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children."
"Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin."
"The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings."
"One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said, “Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.” Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door."
"Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm!"
"I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.”"
"“Poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.” Then she cried, “Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.” So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said, “Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;” so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave me alive, children,"
"“Snowy-white, Rosy-red, Will you beat your lover dead?”"
"When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, “You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.” As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest."
"Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived."
"The snake-king said: ""I sincerely condole with you in your calamity; the tiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell you so, as he cannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our small ones. The king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food. We would now do what we can for your release."
"From this day we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the subjects of this kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall increase a hundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall continue to increase till your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you had better bawl out so as to be heard by them: 'The wretched prince imprisoned me on the false charge of having killed his father, while it was a tiger that killed him. From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions. If I were released I would save all by my powers of healing poisonous wounds and by incantations.' Some one may report this to the king, and if he knows it, you will obtain your liberty."" Thus comforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to pluck up courage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and serpents, acting under the orders of their kings, united in killing as many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years."
"Gangazara sat in the dark cellar, without the sun's light falling upon him, and feasted upon the breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so kindly supplied him with. These delicacies had completely changed his body into a red, stout, huge, unwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full ten years, as prophesied in the horoscope."
"Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber of the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was the only daughter of the king. The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers. He promised half his kingdom and his daughter's hand to him who would restore her to life. Now a servant of the king who had several times overheard Gangazara's cries, reported the matter to him. The king at once ordered the cell to be examined. There was the man sitting in it. How had he managed to live so long in the cell?"
"Some whispered that he must be a divine being. Thus they discussed, while they brought Gangazara to the king."
The king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years'
"imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre to his body. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen. The king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested him to revive his daughter."
"""Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and dead, that remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your dominions; I shall revive them all,"" were the only words that Gangazara spoke."
Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.
"Even graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or two before were taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all were ready, Gangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it over them all, thinking only of his snake-king and tiger-king. All rose up as if from deep slumber, and went to their respective homes."
"The princess, too, was restored to life. The joy of the king knew no bounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself for having believed the word of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand of his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he promised. Gangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to assemble all his subjects in a wood near the town. ""I shall there call in all the tigers and serpents, and give them a general order."""
"When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening, Gangazara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and the Serpent King, who came with all their armies. People began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers. Gangazara assured them of safety, and stopped them."
"The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the holy ashes scattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and snakes humbling themselves at his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god Gangazara. For who else by a single word could thus command vast armies of tigers and serpents, said some among the people. ""Care not for it; it may be by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,"" said others."
"""Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of Ujjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages."" Thus said the Soothsayer's son, and the following reply came from the king of the tigers: ""Why should this base king imprison your honour, believing the mere word of a goldsmith that your honour killed his father? All the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a tiger. I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck."
"I did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The prince makes no inquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect justice from such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of justice we will go on with our destruction."""
"The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a goldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his crime, asked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from that day. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their oath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The goldsmith fled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the king, and was pardoned by the generous Gangazara, whose voice now reigned supreme. All returned to their homes."
The king again pressed Gangazara to accept the hand of his daughter.
"He agreed to do so, not then, but some time afterwards. He wished to go and see his elder brother first, and then to return and marry the princess. The king agreed; and Gangazara left the city that very day on his way home."
"It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to pass near a sea-coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares by that very same route. They met and recognised each other, even at a distance. They flew into each other's arms. Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so great that he died of joy."
"The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a Friday, a day very sacred to that god. The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him. The god came, and asked him what he wanted. ""My poor brother is dead and gone; and this is his corpse. Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing the rites I shall burn him."" Thus said the elder brother, and, giving the corpse to the god Ganesa, he went to prepare himself for that deity's ceremonials. Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas, asking them to watch over it carefully. But instead of that they devoured it."
"The elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother's corpse of the god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front blinking, and fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly enraged. The elder brother was very angry. When the corpse was not forthcoming he cuttingly remarked, ""Is this, after all, the return for my deep belief in you? You are unable even to return my brother's corpse."" Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by his divine power, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life."
"The brothers had a long talk about each other's adventures. They both went to Ujjaini, where Gangazara married the princess, and succeeded to the throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring several benefits upon his brother. And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled."
Harisarman
"There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in a former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bridegroom, and merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron."
"While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him."
"Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his wife at night, ""It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge."" He said this to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on which his master's son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find the horse, though they searched in every direction. Then, while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him, ""My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences; he can get the horse back for you; why do you not ask him?"" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who said, ""Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen, I am called to mind,"" and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words ""I forgot you, forgive me"" and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of pretended diagrams, and said: ""The horse has been placed by thieves on the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring it."" When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman."
"Then Harisarman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta."
"Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his reputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to gain time, and said, ""I will tell you to-morrow,"" and then he was placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the palace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was about. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said: ""O Tongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment in full."" When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard:"
"""Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession."""
"When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: ""Depart, I know all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me."" When he said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But Harisarman reflected in his astonishment: ""Fate brings about, as if in sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear."" Thus thinking, he passed the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the king, by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden, and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate tree, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages."
abandoned by God?  Have we no punishments nor prophets from the Lord?
"Who then will teach us?"" Tyapa spoke strongly and plainly, and there"
"was faith in his words.  He had been speaking a long time, and the"
"teacher, who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition, could"
"not stand it any longer.  He looked at the dry, wrinkled old man, felt"
"the great force of these words, and suddenly began to pity himself.  He"
wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that
Tyapa would be disposed in his favour; he did not wish to speak in such
"a serious, earnest way, but in a soft and fatherly tone.  And the"
teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his
throat ...  But he could not find any powerful words.
"""What kind of a man are you? ...  Your soul seems to be torn away--and"
you still continue speaking ... as if you knew something ...  It would
"be better if you were silent."""
"""Ah, Tyapa, what you say is true,"" replied the teacher, sadly. ""The"
people ... you are right ... they are numberless ... but I am a
stranger to them ... and they are strangers to me ... Do you see where
the tragedy of my life is hidden? ... But let me alone!  I shall suffer
"... and there are no prophets also ...  No.  You are right, I speak a"
great deal ...  But it is no good to anyone.  I shall be always silent
"...  Only don't speak with me like this ...  Ah, old man, you do not"
"know ...  You do not know ...  And you cannot understand."""
"And in the end the teacher cried.  He cried so easily and so freely,"
"with such torrents of flowing tears, that he soon found relief."
"""You ought to go into a village ... become a clerk or a teacher ..."
"You would be well fed there.  What are you crying for?"" asked Tyapa,"
sadly.
"the water for him to fetch, this being in his view the only reason why"
anything was carried in the hand.
"She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened"
windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""I thought you were not coming!  You look pale; are you"
"not well?  Is it the heat?  Or""--he looked hard into her face--""has"
"someone hurt you, my little friend?""  Gyp shook her head. ""Ah, yes,"" he"
"went on irritably; ""you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing!  You"
"close up your pretty face like a flower at night.  At your age, my child,"
one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
"to the stomach.  Put off your mask for once.""  He came close to her."
"""Tell me your troubles.  It is a long time since I have been meaning to"
"ask. Come!  We are only once young; I want to see you happy."""
But Gyp stood looking down.  Would it be relief to pour her soul out?
Would it?  His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not
want to hurt one so kind.  And yet--impossible!
Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano.  Resting his hands on
"the keys, he looked round at her, and said:"
"""I am in love with you, you know.  Old men can be very much in love, but"
"they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to"
feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth.  Come; tell
"me your grief!""  He waited a moment, then said irritably: ""Well, well, we"
"go to music then!"""
"It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood"
"as if prepared to be exceptionally severe.  And Gyp played, whether from"
"overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had"
The Lady’s Maid
_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._
"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?"
"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup"
"over, I thought, perhaps...."
"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She"
drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on
"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much"
of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my
"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and"
they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the
names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to
"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red"
"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping"
"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you"
"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something"
"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve"
"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me"
"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,"
"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,"
"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to"
"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,"
"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her"
hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help
"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her"
out!”
Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated itself from its fellows
and rolled down her withered cheek and dropped upon her withered hand.
"She looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed it across"
her eyes.
"""I swum, I'm cryin'. Don't know as I know when I've cried before. And"
"cryin' before I have anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I"
set such a lot on that boy--it's like I was his mother and his father
"and his brothers and his sisters all mixed up in one--gran'ma, too. He"
"was such a little mite when I took him, y'see and then he's not like"
other boys and I've had to do a heap of lovin' to make up to him. I've
prayed every day of my life for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of
things and that was a pretty big prayer for I don't suppose the Lord
"wants us all to be happy all the time, that ain't His way of bringing"
"us up. But I thought He might make an exception for Lav. Land sakes,"
"how I go on--and you nigh to cryin' yourself."" For she had caught"
Sidney blinking back something glistening from her own eyes.
"""Aunt Achsa, Lavender is wonderful. He's talked to me a lot and he's"
"going to be a great man some day, I know. He has the grandest plans"
"shut away in his heart and he _is_ happy--"""
"Aunt Achsa looked at her, startled. ""Plans--how _can_ he when he's--"""
She bit off the words. Her lips trembled.
"""Aunt Achsa, it doesn't matter what one's like on the outside!"" Now"
Sidney floundered for the second time in one day under the pressure of
"her own thoughts. ""I mean--Lav can do anything he wants to do, anyway."
"And he's working hard reading and studying and some day, after awhile,"
"he'll go away somewhere and study more--"""
my rifle and hopped towards the dressing-station. I think it was the
happiest moment in my life. I lost the sensation of weariness for the
time being. But my foot began to hurt very badly and I got someone to
help me along. My wound was dressed. I got on to a stretcher and I
didn't know anything more until I was taken out of the motor ambulance
"here at the C.C.S. Anyhow, I'm all right now and I'm going to try and"
"get across to Blighty and swing the lead as long as I can."""
There was silence for a while. It had grown dark outside. But the call
from the theatre sounded again. Gradually the waiting-room emptied
itself until at last there were only two men left sitting in front of
the fire. They both seemed depressed and gloomy. Then one of them broke
the silence and said:
"""We was goin' over when a 'eavy one burst. I didn't 'alf cop a packet in"
"me shoulder. It's the third time too, an' I've got the wind up about"
"goin' up the line agin when I'm out o' dock. The third time's yer last,"
"yer know. Fritz'll send one over with me number on it, that's a bloody"
"cert!"""
"""If yer number's up it's up,"" said the other, who had a big patch over"
"his right ear. ""If yer've got ter die yer've got ter die, an' it's no"
"use worryin' about it."""
Their turn came before long and I helped each one to get on to a table.
Then I went over to the Prep. to see if any more walking wounded had
"arrived, but there were none at all."
I stood out in the open for a few minutes in order to breathe the fresh
air. There was a roar and rumble of distant drum-fire. The trees behind
the C.C.S. stood out blackly against the pallid flashes that lit up the
entire horizon.

"was that before me. I was brought up, educated, thrived on thieves'"
"money, I suppose, but until six months ago when my father died, I did"
not know it. I lived much in Monterey--I lived there as a gentleman.
When we met that day I wasn't the thing I am to-day. I only learned the
truth when my father died and left me with a rancho and a band of
"thieves--nothing else--nothing for us all, and I--but what's the good of"
going into it--the circumstances. You wouldn't understand if I did. I
"was my father's son; I have no excuse; I guess, perhaps, it was in"
"me--in the blood. Anyhow, I took to the road, and I didn't mind it much"
after the first time. But I drew the line at killing--I wouldn't have

"raised his eyes and said with a voice that was charged with feeling--""I"

"change, I meant to--"""
"""The devil you did!"" broke from the Girl's lips, but with a sound that"
was not unlike a sob.
"""I did, believe me, I did,"" insisted the man. ""I meant to go straight"
and take you with me--but only honestly--when I could honestly. I meant
"to work for you. Why, every word you said to me to-night about being a"
thief cut into me like a knife. Over and over again I have said to
"myself, she must never know. And now--well, it's all over--I have"
"finished."""
"""An' that's all?"" questioned the Girl with averted face."
"""No--yes--what's the use . . .?"""
The Girl's anger blazed forth again.
plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at
"him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance"
"by me. If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act,"
"say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes. If yer does know"
"him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he"
sent yer.”
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
"“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed"
to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. “A new
"idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose. I—used to know the gentleman"
"who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the"
"police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too"
"loudly. It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might"
attract attention.”
"“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know"
"what I mean, lady. ’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind. He told me to tell yer"
he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to
’Frisco. Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer
told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de
"garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise. He says yer"
"refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick"
"at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.
Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the
"snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against"
the ordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue
"assuring myself that there was no other body near, and peered into her"
"face, I saw that it was seamed and wrinkled. She was barefoot, and her"
clothes were foul and mean. She had the reek of one who slept in
ditches and washed seldom. Her toothless gums grinned at me. She was a
horrible mockery of all that men love in women.
"When I had marked so much, I stood up again, my head reeling. Where"
was the man I had seen scouting up and down? Where was Marie? For a
"moment the wild idea that she had become this thing, that death or"
"magic had transformed the fair young girl into this toothless hag, was"
"not too wild for me. An owl hooted in the distance, and I started and"
shivered and stood looking round me fearfully. Such things were; and
"Marie was gone. In her place this woman, grim and dead and unsightly,"
lay at my feet. What was I to think?
"I got no answer. I raised my voice and called, trembling, on Marie. I"
"ran to one side of the road and the other and called, and still got no"
"answer. I climbed the mound on which the ash-tree stood, and sent my"
voice thrilling through the darkness of the bottom. But only the owl
"answered. Then, knowing nothing else I could do, I went down wringing"
"my hands, and found my lady standing over the body in the road. She"
had come back with Steve and the others.
"I had to listen to their amazement, and a hundred guesses and fancies,"
"which, God help me! had nothing certain in them, and gave me no help."
"The men searched both sides of the road, and beat the moor for a"
"distance, and tried to track the horse--for that was missing too, and"
there lay my only hope--but to no purpose. At last my lady came to me
and said sorrowfully that nothing more could be done.
'In the morning!' I cried jealously.
"70-71, 74-77, 82; as to the general and prolonged resistance of the"
people). During that reign Torquemada is credited with burning ten
"thousand persons in eighteen years (Prescott, _History of Ferdinand"
"and Isabella_, Kirk's ed. 1889, p. 178, citing Llorente. But see p."
"746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;"
"Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of"
scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La
"Rigaudière, _Histoire des persécutions religieuses en Espagne_,"
"1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed"
"furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom"
"(Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in"
"Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,"

"testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist."
"of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136)."
Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels
"his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the"
Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His
"father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only"
"multitudes of Anabaptists but ""thousands and tens of thousands of"
"virtuous and well-disposed men and women"" had then been ""butchered"
"in cold blood"" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on"
"the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In"
"1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,"
"ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the"
"Protestants ""never, and least of all in these days, formed the"
"mass."" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that"
"""nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their"
"opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long"
"absence of Charles, and the slackness of the reins of government"
face had lighted at the girl’s words.
"""Methought I had come to a world where naught was dreamed of save"

"""Oh, and I too—I too!"" breathed the girl softly: and he flashed at her a"
"quick, keen glance of sympathy and interest."
"""I was bred in the country; my grandam brought me up.  I lived with my"
"books, amid silvan solitudes, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers."
This great glittering world of folly and fashion is like a fiery wheel
"going round in my head.  Ofttimes I could cry aloud for mercy, the pain"
and bewilderment are so great.  I know there must be noble men and good
"in this strange Pandemonium; but I know not where to find them, and my"
heart grows sick.  Would that I could go back to my books and my dreams!
"But alas! a maiden may not choose for herself."""
"""Still there is life here,"" spoke Grey quickly, ""and it behoves us to"
know men as well as books.  I have studied both.  I will study them
"again.  I would fain learn all that life has to teach, whether for weal"
or woe.  No hermit-monk was ever truly a man. Yet there be times when
"one shrinks in amaze from all one sees and hears."""
The chord of sympathy was struck.  They passed from one thing to
another.  She found one at last who knew and loved the poets of her
"childhood’s dreams—who could talk of Spenser and Sidney, of Watson,"
"Greville, and Drayton, quoting their verses, and often lighting upon her"
"favourite passages.  Here was a man who knew Milton and Clarendon,"
"Hobbes, Herbert, Lovelace and Suckling, Lord Herbert of Cherbury and"
"Izaak Walton.  He had read eagerly, like herself, poetry and prose,"
"back of her hand with a most unchildlike gesture, and forthwith"
concealed it in her silken _faja_. Then she laid her hand once more on
the Sergeant's arm.
"""You will lead us, will you not, José Maria?"" she said pleadingly. ""I"
can trust you. You have done many great deeds. My nurse was a woman of
Ronda and told me of your exploits on the road from Madrid to Sevilla.
You will lead us to-night. Only you must leave these three in the palace
"to me. If you will, you shall have also my share of the plunder. But"
"what do I say, I know you are too noble to think only of that--as these"
"wolves do!"""
She cast a haughty glance around upon the gipsies at their card-play.
"""I, that am of Old Castile and noble by four descents, have demeaned"
"myself to mix with _Gitanos_,"" she said, ""but it has only been that I"
might work out my revenge. I told Pépe there of my plan. I showed him
"the way. He was afraid. He told ten men, and they were afraid. Fifty,"
"and they were afraid. Now there are a hundred and more, and were it not"
"that they know that all lies open and unguarded, even I could not lead"
"them thither. But they will follow you, because you are José Maria of"
"Ronda."" The Sergeant took the girl's hand in his. She was shaking as"
"with an ague fit, but her eyes, blue and mild as a summer sky, had that"
within them which was deadlier than the tricksome slippery demon that
"lurks in all black orbs, whether masculine or feminine."
"""Chica,"" he said, ""your wrongs are indeed bitter. I would give much to"
help you to set the balance right. Perhaps I may do so yet. But I cannot
be the commander of these men. They are not of my folk or country. They
have not even asked me to lead them. They are jealous of me! You see it
"as well as I!"""
Nelson. More than once Sidney donned the cherry crêpe de chine and
"dined with Mrs. Allan and Pola and Dugald at the hotel, feeling very"
grand and traveled.
But to Sidney's deep regret Pola professed an abhorrence of swimming.
"""Just please don't _ask_ me,"" she had begged, shuddering. ""I loathe it!"
It's one of my complexes. Of course I've gone swimming in almost every
"body of water on the globe, but I hate it. You'll spoil my fun"
"_utterly_ if you even try to make me!"" After that Sidney could not"
"urge. She did not know what complexes were, but Pola had made them"
sound real and convincing and a little delicate. Though Sidney missed
the jolly swims with Lavender and Mart she refrained from even a hint
of her feelings.
Often when they were together Pola waxed confidential over her cousin.
"""He's a thorn in Aunt Lucy's side,"" she explained one day as the girls"
"lounged in Pola's room at the hotel, a huge box of candy on a stool"
"between them. ""She always wants him to go in for society and to go"
"abroad with her and do all the fashionable resorts on the Continent,"
"but couldn't you _see_ him? Not for Duggie boy, ever! When she starts"
planning something like that he bolts off somewhere and the next thing
you hear is that he's painted a wonderful picture and sold it or had
first mention or a gold medal. Of course that makes him terribly
interesting and there are dozens of single ladies from forty to
fourteen itching to catch him. And Dug's such a simple old dear that he
doesn't know it. But his mother does and she has them all sorted over
and the eligible ones ticketed. You see Dug will be dreadfully rich
some day and goodness knows what he'll do with the money for he hasn't
the brains of a child where business is concerned. His father's even
"richer than Dad."""
"""Please don't make scenes in the street, and don't follow me like this."
"If you want to talk to me, you can--at home."""
"Then, very calmly, she turned and walked on.  But he was still following"
"her, some paces off.  She did not quicken her steps, and to the first"
"taxicab driver that passed she made a sign, and saying:"
"""Bury Street--quick!"" got in.  She saw Fiorsen rush forward, too late to"
"stop her.  He threw up his hand and stood still, his face deadly white"
under his broad-brimmed hat.  She was far too angry and upset to care.
"From the moment she turned to the window at Monsieur Harmost's, she had"
determined to go to her father's.  She would not go back to Fiorsen; and
the one thought that filled her mind was how to get Betty and her baby.
"Nearly four!  Dad was almost sure to be at his club.  And leaning out,"
"she said: ""No; Hyde Park Corner, please."""
"The hall porter, who knew her, after calling to a page-boy: ""Major"
"Winton--sharp, now!"" came specially out of his box to offer her a seat"
and The Times.
"Gyp sat with it on her knee, vaguely taking in her surroundings--a thin"
"old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner, a white-calved"
footman crossing with a tea-tray; a number of hats on pegs; the
"green-baize board with its white rows of tapelike paper, and three"
"members standing before it.  One of them, a tall, stout,"
"good-humoured-looking man in pince-nez and a white waistcoat, becoming"
"conscious, removed his straw hat and took up a position whence, without"
"staring, he could gaze at her; and Gyp knew, without ever seeming to"
"glance at him, that he found her to his liking.  She saw her father's"
"unhurried figure passing that little group, all of whom were conscious"
"now, and eager to get away out of this sanctum of masculinity, she met"
"for nine millions of square miles over half Asia, much of Persia,"
and now claim to control the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor? If
England might claim a large section of Persia as her sphere of
"influence, and Egypt likewise and a fourth part of Africa, much of"
"Arabia, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, why might not Germany and"
Austria expect to have their little spheres of influence in the
"Balkans, in Asia Minor, in Mesopotamia? We had helped France to"
Morocco and Italy to Tripoli; why should we bother about Servia? It
"might be unkind, but then were we not unkind towards her father's"
"country, Ireland? Were we very tender towards national independence"
"in Egypt, in Persia?"
"Yet this brutal invasion of France, this unprovoked attack on Liège"
were ugly things. France had shown no disposition to egg Servia on
"against Austria, and Sir Edward Grey in the last days of June--she"
"now learnt for the first time, for she had seen no newspapers in"
"prison, where it is part of the dehumanizing policy of the Home"
"Office to prevent their entry, or the dissemination of any"
information about current events--Sir Edward Grey had clearly shown
Great Britain did not approve of Servian intrigues in Bosnia. Well:
let the best man win. Germany was just as likely to give the Vote to
her women as was Britain. The Germans were first in Music and in
"Science. She for her part didn't wish to become a German subject,"
but once the War was over she would willingly naturalize herself
Belgian or Swiss.
And the War must soon be over. Europe as a whole could not allow
this devastation of resources. America would intervene. Already the
Germans realized their gigantic blunder in starting the attack.
Their men were said to be--she read--much less brave than people had
expected. The mighty German Armies had been held up for ten days by
a puny Belgian force and the forts of Liège and Namur. There would
"autumn use, but he keeps putting it off, and probably it will not be done"
"at all. So far it hasn't mattered, but this morning's first wet snow has"
covered the hay outdoors and the maltreated land. And so it will remain
"till next spring. Poor Paul! He is an easygoing man at heart, but he"
"pushes doggedly on against a whirlwind; sometimes he smiles to himself,"
knowing how useless it is to struggle--a distorted smile.
"His father, the old man alone in his room, stands sometimes on his"
"threshold, as he used to do, and reflects. He is lost in memories, for he"
has ninety years behind him. The many houses on the farm confuse him a
"little; the roofs are all too big for him, and he is afraid they might"
come down and carry him off. Once he asked Josephine if it was right that
his hands and fingers should run away from him every day across the
"fields. So they put mittens on his hands, but he took to chewing them; in"
"fact he ate everything he was given, and enjoyed a good digestion. So they"
"must be thankful he had his health, Josephine said, and could be up and"
about.

"I did not follow the others across the field, but returned the way I had"
"come last spring, down toward the woods and the sea. It is fitting that I"
"should go back, always back, never forward again."
"I passed the hut where Solem and I had lived together, and then the"
"Lapps--the two old people and Olga, this strange cross between a human"
"being and a dwarf birch. A stove stood against the peat wall, and a"
paraffin lamp hung from the roof of their stone-age dwelling. Olga was
"kind and helpful, but she looked tiny and pathetic, like a ruffled hen; it"
"pained me to watch her flit about the room, tiny and crooked, as she"
looked for a pair of reindeer cheeses for me.
"nothing is wasted.  But a baby!""  And he chirruped his lips. ""Well;"
"courage!  We shall do things yet!"""
Gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips.  The scent of
"latakia tobacco that had soaked into things, and of old books and music,"
"a dark smell, like Monsieur Harmost's complexion; the old brown curtains,"
"the sooty little back garden beyond, with its cat-runs, and its one"
stunted sumach tree; the dark-brown stare of Monsieur Harmost's rolling
"eyes brought back that time of happiness, when she used to come week"
"after week, full of gaiety and importance, and chatter away, basking in"
"his brusque admiration and in music, all with the glamourous feeling that"
"she was making him happy, and herself happy, and going to play very"
finely some day.
"The voice of Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, as if he knew what she was"
"feeling, increased her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird"
"blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered."
He was saying:
"""Come, come!  The only thing we cannot cure is age.  You were right to"
"come, my child.  Music is your proper air.  If things are not all what"
"they ought to be, you shall soon forget.  In music--in music, we can get"
"away.  After all, my little friend, they cannot take our dreams from"
"us--not even a wife, not even a husband can do that.  Come, we shall have"
"good times yet!"""
"And Gyp, with a violent effort, threw off that sudden weakness. From"
those who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour.  She left
"Monsieur Harmost that afternoon, infected by his passion for music."
Poetic justice--on which all homeopathy is founded--was at work to try
"and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it.  To music, she now"
"gave all the hours she could spare. She went to him twice a week,"
"Before the curtains of history lifted, one feels the world was like"
this--this Celtic bareness and sombreness and _air_. But perhaps it is
not Celtic at all: Iberian. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than our
conception of what is Celtic and what is not Celtic. I believe there
"never were any Celts, as a race.--As for the Iberians--!"

"Wonderful to go out on a frozen road, to see the grass in shadow bluish"
"with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams"
"melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and"
"things standing up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with"
"roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in"
"the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad,"
"on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk"
"down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk"
"on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is"
"built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all"
"so familiar to my _feet_, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if"
"I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on"
lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are
"dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is"
much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under
"the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and"
"I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and"
withers.

After coming to a deep well in a grassy plot in a wide space of the
"road, I go back, across the sunny naked upland country, towards the pink"

"Gyp produced her card.  The maid looked at it, at Gyp, and at two"
"brown-painted doors, as much as to say, ""Where will you have it?"" Then,"
"opening the first of them, she said:"
"""Tyke a seat, please; I'll fetch her."""
"Gyp went in.  In the middle of what was clearly the dining-room, she"
tried to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea. The table
"against which her hand rested was covered with red baize, no doubt to"
keep the stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood. On the mahogany
sideboard reposed a cruet-stand and a green dish of very red apples.  A
bamboo-framed talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood
before a fireplace filled with pampas-grass dyed red.  The chairs were of
"red morocco, the curtains a brownish-red, the walls green, and on them"
hung a set of Landseer prints.  The peculiar sensation which red and
green in juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to Gyp's
"distress. And, suddenly, her eyes lighted on a little deep-blue china"
"bowl. It stood on a black stand on the mantel-piece, with nothing in it."
"To Gyp, in this room of red and green, with the smell of mutton creeping"
"in, that bowl was like the crystallized whiff of another world.  Daphne"
"Wing--not Daisy Wagge--had surely put it there! And, somehow, it touched"
"her--emblem of stifled beauty, emblem of all that the girl had tried to"
pour out to her that August afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago.
"Thin Eastern china, good and really beautiful!  A wonder they allowed it"
to pollute this room!
"A sigh made her turn round.  With her back against the door and a white,"
"scared face, the girl was standing.  Gyp thought: 'She has suffered"
"horribly.'  And, going impulsively up to her, she held out her hand."
"""I shall just see the elections through, and Perry well started--at"
"least, I suppose it'll be Perry--and then we'll be off. Shan't you be"
"glad to see the old home again, Al?"""
"""It's so sudden,"" she said. ""I shall be sorry to leave here."""
"""Oh, so shall I--very sorry to leave some of the people too. Still, it's"
"a good thing. Where's Eleanor? I must tell her. I say, Dick gets here"
"to-morrow."""
"""Oh, I'm so glad."""
"The Governor hurried out again, and Alicia returned to the sofa. The"
knot of her troubles had been rudely cut. Perhaps this summary ending
"was best. She herself would not, she knew, have had the strength to tear"
"herself away from that place, but if fate tore her--perhaps well and"
good. Nothing but unhappiness waited there for her; it seemed to her
"that nothing but unhappiness waited anywhere now; but at least, over at"
"home, she would not have to fear the discovery of her secret, the secret"
"she herself kept so badly, nor to endure the torture of gossip, hints,"
"and clumsy pity. No one, over at home, would think of Medland; they"
"might just know his name, might perhaps have heard him rumoured for a"
dangerous man and a vexatious opponent of good Sir Robert. Certainly
they would never think of him as the cause of bruising of heart to a
young lady in fashionable society. So he would pass out of her life; she
"would leave him to his busy, strenuous, happy-unhappy life, so full of"
"triumphs and defeats, of ups and downs, of the love of many and the hate"
"of many. Perhaps she, like the rest, would read his name in the _Times_"
"now and then, unless indeed he were utterly vanquished. No, he was not"
finally beaten. Of that she was sure. His name would be read often in
"cold print, but the glow of the life he lived would be henceforth"
"leave her lying in Genoa!"""
"""I'll attend to my own end of the business,"" said Captain Dove with"
"angry decision. ""If you're going to London by train to-night, so am I."
"If you like to come back on board with me, I'll sail you round. But I'm"
"not the only man on the _Olive Branch_ who can sail a ship. Why, I've"
half a dozen broken captains--and most of 'em with extra masters'
"certificates, too--among my crew."
"""I've left Brasse and Da Costa in charge, and they'll work her across"
the Bay if I tell them to. I've only to send them a wire. And all you
have to do now is to say which way you want to travel--with me; for I'm
"going to stick to you like a leech till the day you pay me off."""
"Slyne walked to the window, humming a tune. But it was obviously costing"
him all of his refreshed fortitude to refrain from expressing his real
"sentiments toward Captain Dove. His face, as he stood glaring blindly"
"out at the beautiful scene before him, was like that of a wild beast"
"balked of its fair prey. But from between his bared, set teeth the"
careless hum came unbroken.
"""I think you're foolish,"" was all he said when he turned again,"
convinced that it would be a waste of time to argue the matter with the
"old man, ""but--suit yourself. Jobling and I _must_ get to London with"
Sal--Lady Josceline at the earliest possible moment. If you insist on
travelling with us to-night--so be it. All I want you to understand is
"that there's to be no more drinking, and that you must be advised by me"
in every other particular. This isn't really the sort of game you're
liable to shine in. It would be far better for all of us if you'd stay
"on board your ship."""
Captain Dove's weather-beaten countenance was turning slowly purple. He
"Several voices muttered ""Thank God,"" but one man's teeth were still"
chattering as though he was so absorbed by his own fear that he had not
noticed the disappearance of its cause. Soon there was complete silence
and one by one we fell asleep.
Another clear day and another clear night. We lay awake listening
anxiously to the bursting of bombs and the muttering of anti-aircraft
fire. But we went to sleep in the end and felt drowsy all the following
day--a clear day. Casualties came in from a camp that had been bombed
"overnight, and we saw shattered limbs, smashed heads, and lacerated"
flesh. Several of our men were looking pale through lack of sleep and
had dark rings round their eyes.
"Another clear night. The agonizing vigil began again, but I was so weary"
that I went to sleep a few minutes after lights out. Sullen thunders
mingled with my dreams and did not wake me up.
Another clear day. Would the fine weather never end? Late in the
"afternoon, however, a few clouds collected on the horizon. In the"
evening the entire sky was overcast and not a star was to be seen. And
as we went to bed we heard the rain swishing down upon the canvas roof.
The unspeakable joy we all felt at the prospect of an untroubled night!
"""Bloody fine, this rain: we'll get some proper sleep now, thank God. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life, and I've been out here"
"since '15 and in some pretty hot places too."""
"""I reckon the longer yer out 'ere the windier yer get. I joined up in"
'14 like a bloody fool. At first I didn't care a damn for anything. Then
I was wounded on the Somme an' sent across to Blighty. I dreaded comin'
"back agin. I only 'ad a little wound in me 'and, an' I used ter plug it"
"wi' dubbin' an' boot-polish ter keep it raw. It didn't 'alf 'urt, but it"

"""So you've turned into a hotelkeeper,"" I said."
"""Well, you can joke about it,"" he returned, ""but all I do is to give"
shelter to the people who come here. That's all the hotel there is to it.
"My neighbor Olaus can't do any more either, even if he builds a place"
that's ten times as big. Look over there--now he's building another
"house--a shed, I'd call it--and he's got three grown men working on it so"
he can get it done by next summer. But it won't be much bigger than my
"place at that, and anyhow, the gentry don't want to be bothered walking"
all that distance to his place when here's my house right at the car stop.
"And besides it was me that started it, and if I was Olaus I wouldn't have"
wanted to imitate me like a regular monkey and started keeping boarders
which I didn't know the first thing about. But he can't make himself any
"different from what he is, so he puts up a few old bits of canvas and rugs"
and cardboard inside his barn and gets people to sleep there. But I'd
"never ask the gentry to sleep in a barn, a storehouse for fodder and hay"
"for dumb beasts, if you'll excuse my mentioning it! But of course if"
"you've no shame in you and don't know how to behave in company--"""
"""Lucky I've met you,"" I said. ""Why, I might have gone on down the road to"
"his place!"""
"We walked on together, with Eilert talking and explaining all the way, and"
assuring me over and over again that Olaus was a good-for-nothing for
copying him as he did.
"If I had known what was awaiting me, I should certainly have passed by"
"Eilert's house. But I did not know. I was innocent, though I may not have"
appeared so. It cannot be helped.

honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his
"Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of"
Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity

"POUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"On August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of"
"Boston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,"
five other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took
"command, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The"
first vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.
"Pound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed"
"him, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised"
fishermen.
"He then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the"
guard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his
"crew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,"
"the _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and"
"several other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of"
"Pound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him."
"The pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight"
"took place before the pirates struck their ""Red flagg."" The prisoners were"
"cast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being"
Of course I ought to be old enough to understand what all sensible

"From old habit, I still take an interest in the few of us who are left;"
Miss Torsen is still here.
"Miss Torsen--what more is there to be said about her? Well, she does not"
"leave; she stays here to complete the picture of the woman Torsen, child"
of the middle class who has read schoolbooks all through her formative
"years, who has learned all about _Artemis cotula_, but undernourished"
her soul. That is what she is doing here.
"I remember a few weeks ago, when we were infested with Englishmen, a young"
sprout coming down from the mountain top with a bloodstained rag which he
"threw on the ground, saying, ""Here's what's left of your lawyer that fell"
"off!"" Miss Torsen heard it, and never moved a muscle. No, she never"
"mourned the death of the lawyer very keenly; on the contrary, she wrote"
"off at once to ask another friend to come. When he came, he turned out to"
"be a swaggering scatterbrain--a ""free lance,"" he called himself in the"
visitors' book. I have not mentioned him before because he was less
"important than she; less important, in fact, than any of us. He was"
beardless and wore his collar open; heaven knows if he wasn't employed at
"a theater or in the films. Miss Torsen went to meet him when he came, and"
"said, ""Welcome to our mountains,"" and ""Thanks for coming."" So evidently"
she had sent for him. But why did she not leave? Why did she seem to
"strike root in the place, and even ask others to come here? Yet she had"
been the first to want to leave last summer! There was something behind
this.
soon found it; but there I came to a check. Round the churchyard stood
"a number of quiet family houses, many-gabled and shaded by limes, and"
doubtless once occupied by reverend canons and prebendaries. But no
"one of these held such a position that it could shoulder Herr Krapp's,"
or be by any possibility the house I wanted. The churchyard lay too
far from the street for that.
I walked up the row twice before I would admit this; but at last I
"made it certain. Still Herr Krapp must know his own premises, and not"
"much cast down, I was going to knock at a chance door and put the"
"question, when my eyes fell on a man who sat at work in the"
"churchyard. He wore a mason's apron, and was busily deepening the"
inscription on a tablet let into the church wall. He seemed to be the
"very man to know, and I went to him."
"'I want a house which looks into the Neu Strasse,' I said. 'It is the"
next house to Herr Krapp's. Can you direct me to the door?'
"He looked at me for a moment, his hammer suspended. Then he pointed to"
"the farther end of the row. 'There is an alley,' he said in a hoarse,"
croaking voice. 'The door is at the end.'
"I thought his occupation an odd one, considering the state of the"
"city; but I had other things to dwell on, and hastened off to the"
"place he indicated. Here, sure enough, I found the mouth of a very"
"narrow passage which, starting between the last house and a blind"
"wall, ran in the required direction. It was a queer place, scarcely"
"wider than my shoulders, and with two turns so sharp that I remember"
wondering how they brought their dead out. In one part it wound under
"the timbers of a house; it was dark and somewhat foul, and altogether"
so ill-favoured a path that I was glad I had brought my arms.

"representative to be unsustainable. For various reasons, the German"
"Government would not permit it, and he was afraid neither Vivie nor"
her mother would get enough backing from the British authorities to
strengthen the American demand. She must stop on in Brussels till
the War came to an end.
"""But how are we to live?"" asked Vivie, with a catch in her throat."
"""Our supply of Belgian money is coming to an end. My mother has"
considerable funds invested in England. These she can't touch. She
"has other sums in German securities, but soon after the War they"
stopped sending her the interest on the plea that she was an
"'enemy.' As to the money we have in Belgium, the bank in Brussels"
"can tell me nothing. What are we to do?"" The rather cold-mannered"
American diplomatist--it was one of the Secretaries of Legation and
"he knew all about Mrs. Warren's past, and regarded Vivie as an"
outlaw--said he would try to communicate with her friends in England
"and see if through the American Relief organization, funds could be"
transmitted for their maintenance. She gave him the addresses of
"Rossiter, Praed, and her mother's London bankers."
Vivie now tried to settle down to a life of usefulness. To increase
their resources she gave lessons in English to Belgians and even to
German officers. She offered herself to various groups of Belgian
ladies who had taken up such charities as the Germans permitted. She
also asked to be taken on as a Red Cross helper. But in all these
directions she had many snubs to meet and little encouragement.
Scandal had been busy with her name--the unhappy reputation of her
"mother, the peculiar circumstances under which she had left England,"
the two or three months shut up at Tervueren with Colonel von
"Giesselin, and the very protection he now accorded her and her"
mother at the Hotel Impérial. She felt herself looked upon almost as
"been there, and had secured all the little snakes. There were seven of"
them.
"We asked the boys what they intended to do with the snakes, and they"
answered that they would show them to their friends in the village. 'And
then?' we asked. And then they would let them go in the water. My friend
"killed all the hamadryads on the spot, and gave the boys some coppers,"
and we went on. Can you imagine this happening anywhere else? Can you
"think of any other schoolboys sparing any animal they caught, much less"
poisonous snakes? The extraordinary hold that this tenet of their
religion has upon the Burmese must be seen to be understood. What I
"write will sound like some fairy story, I fear, to my people at home. It"
is far beneath the truth. The belief that it is wrong to take life is a
belief with them as strong as any belief could be. I do not know
"anywhere any command, earthly or heavenly, that is acted up to with such"
earnestness as this command is amongst the Burmese. It is an abiding
principle of their daily life.
Where the command came from I do not know. I cannot find any allusion to
it in the life of the great teacher. We know that he ate meat. It seems
to me that it is older even than he. It has been derived both by the
Burmese Buddhists and the Hindus from a faith whose origin is hidden in
the mists of long ago. It is part of that far older faith on which
"Buddhism was built, as was Christianity on Judaism."
But if not part of his teaching--and though it is included in the sacred
"books, we do not know how much of them are derived from the Buddha"
himself--it is in strict accordance with all his teaching. That is one
"of the most wonderful points of Buddhism, it is all in accordance; there"
are no exceptions.
I have heard amongst Europeans a very curious explanation of this
"said ""with all her own private grudge against the present ministry"
she felt _au fond_ she was _British_; she must range herself in time
"of war with her own people."""
Mrs. Warren went much farther. She was not very voluble nowadays.
The German occupation of her villa had given her a mental and
physical shock from which she never recovered. She often sat quite
silent and rather huddled at meal times and looked the old woman
now. In such a conversation as this she roused herself and her voice
"took an aggressive tone. ""My daughter write to her friends to ask"
them to obstruct the government at such a time as this? _Never!_ I'd
"disown her if she did, I'd repudiate her! She may have had her own"
"turn-up with 'em. I was quite with her there. But that, so to"
"speak, was only a domestic quarrel. We're British all through, and"
don't you forget it--sir--(she added deprecatingly): British _all
"through_ and we're goin' to beat Germany yet, _you'll_ see. The"
"British navy never _has_ been licked nor won't be, this time."""
Colonel von Giesselin did not insist. He seemed depressed himself at
"times, and far from elated at the victories announced in his own"
newspapers. He would in the dreary autumn evenings show them the
photographs of his wife--a sweet-looking woman--and his two
"solid-looking, handsome children, and talk with rapture of his home"
"life. Why, indeed, was there this War! His heart like his Emperor's"
bled for these unhappy Belgians. But it was all due to the
"Macchiavellian policy of ""Sir Grey and Asquiss."" If Germany had not"
felt herself surrounded and barred from all future expansion of
trade and influence she would not have felt forced to attack France
"and invade Belgium. Why, see! All the time they were talking,"
"barbarous Russia, egged on by England, was ravaging East Prussia!"
"Then, in other moods, he would lament the war and the policy of"
"full of rocks, but it is straight. It will lead us somewhere, not round"
and round and round again--it will take us somewhere. And there is a
"light,' they said, 'before us, the light of a star. It is very small"
"now, but it is always steady; it never flickers or wanes. It is the star"
of Truth. Under that star we shall find that which we seek.'
"And so they went upon their road, toiling upon the rocks, falling now"
"and then, bleeding with wounds from the sharp points, sore-footed, but"
strong-hearted. And ever as they went they were farther and farther from
"the forest, farther and farther from the glades and the flowers with"
deadly scents; they heard less and less the crack of the whip of Time
falling upon the wanderers' shoulders.
"The star grew nearer and nearer, the light grew greater and greater, the"
"false lights died behind them, until at last they came out of the"
"forest, and there they found the lake that washes away all desire under"
the sun of Truth.
They had won their way. Time and Life and Fight and Struggle were behind
"them, could not follow them, as they came, weary and footsore, into the"
Great Peace.
"And of those who were left behind, of those who stayed in the glades to"
"gather the deadly flowers, to be driven ever forward by the whip of"
Time--what of them? Surely they will learn. The kindly whip of Time is
behind: he will never let them rest in such a deadly forest; they must
"go ever forward; and as they go they grow more and more weary, the"
"glades are more and more distasteful, the heavy-scented blossoms more"
and more repulsive. They will find out the thorns too. At first they
"forgot the thorns in the flowers. 'The blossoms are beautiful,' they"
"said; 'what care we for the thorns? Nay, the thorns are good. It is a"
pleasure to fight with them. What would the forest be without its
confinement of Sicily. Room--give me room--give me room for my spirit:
and you can have all the toppling crags of romance.
"So we ran on through the gold of the afternoon, across a wide, almost"
"Celtic landscape of hills, our little train winding and puffing away"
"very nimbly. Only the heath and scrub, breast-high, man-high, is too big"
"and brigand-like for a Celtic land. The horns of black, wild-looking"
cattle show sometimes.
"After a long pull, we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness."
"Each time, it looks as if there were nothing beyond--no more"
habitations. And each time we come to a station.
Most of the people have left the train. And as with men driving in a
"gig, who get down at every public-house, so the passengers usually"
alight for an airing at each station. Our old fat friend stands up and
"tucks his shirt-tail comfortably in his trousers, which trousers all the"
"time make one hold one's breath, for they seem at each very moment to be"
"just dropping right down: and he clambers out, followed by the long,"
brown stalk of a wife.
"So the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes, in the way the"
"trains have. At last we hear whistles and horns, and our old fat friend"
running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it
sets off. At the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from
"outside. We all jump up. There, down the line, is the long brown stork"
"of a wife. She had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off,"
"for a few words, and has now seen the train moving."
"Now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek"
"""Madonna!"" through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees,"
and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after
"corrected by him and all those divines, whom he distrusted, would watch"
him at close quarters. But it was only to be for a few months. 'I have
"removed to Louvain', he writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 'till I"
"shall decide which residence is best suited to old age, which is already"
knocking at the gate importunately.'
"As it turned out, he was to spend four years (1517-21) at Louvain. His"
"life was now becoming more stationary, but because of outward"
circumstances rather than of inward quiet. He kept deliberating all
"those years whether he should go to England, Germany or France, hoping"
at last to find the brilliant position which he had always coveted and
never had been able or willing to grasp.
The years 1516-18 may be called the culmination of Erasmus's career.
Applauding crowds surrounded him more and more. The minds of men were
seemingly prepared for something great to happen and they looked to
"Erasmus as the man! At Brussels, he was continually bothered with visits"
"from Spaniards, Italians and Germans who wanted to boast of their"
"interviews with him. The Spaniards, with their verbose solemnity,"
particularly bored him. Most exuberant of all were the eulogies with
which the German humanists greeted him in their letters. This had begun
"already on his first journey to Basle in 1514. 'Great Rotterdamer',"
"'ornament of Germany', 'ornament of the world' were some of the simplest"
"effusions. Town councils waited upon him, presents of wine and public"
banquets were of common occurrence. No one expresses himself so
hyperbolically as the jurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg. 'I am pointed
"out in public', he asserts, 'as the man who has received a letter from"
"Erasmus.' 'Thrice greatest hero, you great Jove' is a moderate"
"apostrophe for him. 'The Swiss', Zwingli writes in 1516, 'account it a"
great glory to have seen Erasmus.' 'I know and I teach nothing but
"Erasmus now,' writes Wolfgang Capito. Ulrich von Hutten and Henry"
"Glareanus both imagine themselves placed beside Erasmus, as Alcibiades"
ghost-like.  I had wronged her; I felt confident that I had.  All came
"back to me now--that cruel, scandalous denunciation I had uttered in the"
heat of my mad jealousy--the false tale which had struck her dumb by its
"circumstantial accuracy.  Ah! how bitter it all was, now that punishment"
"was upon me!  I remembered how, in the hour of my worldly triumph and of"
her highest hope--at the very moment when she had spoken words of
greater affection to me than she had ever used before--I had made the
"charge against her, and she had fallen back with her young heart crushed"
"within her.  My ring was there, still glittering mockingly upon her dead"
hand.  By the unfounded charge I had made against her I had sinned.  My
"sin at that moment arose from its grave, and barred the way for ever to"
all hope--to all happiness.
"The summer twilight was stealing on apace, and in the silence of the"
room there sounded the roar of life from the boulevard below.  Men were
"crying _Le Soir_ with strident voices, and all Paris was on its way to"
"dine, and afterwards to enjoy itself in idleness upon the terraces of"
the cafes or at those al-fresco variety performances in the Avenue des
"Champs Elysees, where the entrance fee includes a consommation."
"Deane still held my old love's hand, bending in the dim light until his"
"eyes were close to it, watching intently.  But I took no notice, for my"
"eyes were fixed upon that face that had held me in such fascination, and"
had been so admired at those brilliant receptions given by King Leopold
"and the Countess of Flanders.  The doctor stretched forth his hand, and"
of a sudden switched on the electric light.  The next instant I was
startled by his loud ejaculation of surprise.
"""Thank God!"" he cried.  ""She's not dead, after all!"""
"""Not dead!""  I gasped, unable fully to realise his meaning."
"1915; H. Wildon Carr, _The Philosophy of B. Croce_, London, 1917. The"
"first is an able, but very cursory sketch; the second examines Croce's"
philosophy from the standpoint of neoscholasticism; the third is an
ample summary written by a distinguished writer well acquainted with
the various currents of modern thought. Each of them ought to be read
with a critical and discriminating eye.
"In the English-speaking world, Croce's fame rests emphatically on his"
"Ã¦sthetics, and its applications to literary criticism. His influence"
on English and American critical thought has already gone much deeper
than a mere list of writings on his theories would show; especially in
"England, his ideas are, so to speak, in the air, and appear in many"
writers who have no direct knowledge of his work. The best exposition
of this phase of his philosophy is to be found in E. F. Carritt's
"book, _The Theory of Beauty_, 1914, chap. XIV. The writings of A. B."
"Walkley, and of J. E. Spingam, contain the most vigorous prosecution"
"of his thought as applied, respectively, to English and to American"
scholarship and criticism.
"For the general history of Italian thought, to which many a reference"
"is made in the course of this book, the best helps, besides Croce's"
"essay on Vico, and B. Spaventa, _La filosofia italiana_, recently"
"reprinted, Bari, 1909, are the historical works of Giovanni Gentile,"
"and especially his _Storia della filosofia italiana_, Milano, n."
d. Gentile is one of the most profound and earnest modern European
"thinkers, and it is desirable that his theoretical works, similar in"
"tendency to, but widely divergent in temper from those of Croce, should"
"become better known to the Anglo-Saxon world. Two of his books, _La"
"Riforma dell' Educazione_ and _Teoria generale dello Spirito_, are soon"
to appear in English. Croce's judgment on Gentile's Actual Idealism is
"expressed in _Una discussione tra filosofi amici_, in _Conversazioni"
"Critiche_, II, pp. 67-95. But a complete understanding of the vital"
mother had better pursue: leave Tervueren and seek a lodging in
Brussels; or retreat as far as Ghent or Bruges or even Holland? The
clerk reassured her. The Germans had certainly occupied the
"south-east of Belgium, but dared not push as far to the west and"
north as Brussels. They risked otherwise being nipped between the
Belgian army of Antwerp and the British force marching on Mons....
He directed her attention to the last _communiqué_ of the Ministry
"of War: ""La situation n'a jamais été meilleure. Bruxelles, à l'abri"
"d'un coup de main, est défendue par vingt mille gardes civiques"
"armés d'un excellent fusil,"" etc."
Vivie returned therefore a trifle reassured. At the same time she
and her mother spent some hours in packing up and posting valuable
"securities to London, via Ostende, in packing for deposit in the"
strong rooms of a Brussels bank Mrs. Warren's jewellery and plate.
The tram service from Tervueren had ceased to run. So they induced a
neighbour to drive them into Brussels in a chaise: a slow and
wearisome journey under a broiling sun. Arrived in Brussels they
found the town in consternation. Placarded on the walls was a notice
signed by the Burgomaster--the celebrated Adolphe Max--informing the
Bruxellois that in spite of the resistances of the Belgian army it
was to be feared the enemy might soon be in occupation of Brussels.
"In such an event he adjured the citizens to avoid all panic, to give"
"no legitimate cause of offence to the Germans, to renounce any idea"
of resorting to arms! The Germans on their part were bound
"by the laws of war to respect private property, the lives of"
"non-combatants, the honour of women, and the exercise of religion."
Vivie and her mother found the banks closed and likewise the railway
station. They now had but one thought: to get back as quickly as
"possible to Villa Beau-séjour, and fortunately for their dry-mouthed"
impatience their farmer friend was of the same mind. Along the
"""Kyrie Eleison! Christe Eleison! Kyrie Eleison!"""
"A faint cold tremor crept through his veins,--his heart beat"
"violently,--again he vainly strove to open the great door. Was there a"
choir practising inside at this hour of the night? Surely not!
"Then,--from whence had this music its origin? Stooping, he bent his ear"
"to the crevice of the closed portal,--but, as suddenly as they had"
"begun, the harmonies ceased; and all was once more profoundly still."
"Drawing a long, deep breath, he stood for a moment amazed and lost in"
"thought--these sounds, he felt sure, were not of earth but of heaven!"
they had the same ringing sweetness as those he had heard on the Field
"of Ardath! What might they mean to him, here and now? Quick as a flash"
the answer came--DEATH! God had taken pity upon his solitary earth
"wanderings,--and the prayers of Edris had shortened his world-exile and"
"probation! He was to die! and that solemn singing was the warning,--or"
"the promise,--of his approaching end!"
"Yes! it must be so, he decided, as, with a strange, half-sad peace at"
"his heart, he quietly descended the steps of the Dom,-he would perhaps"
"be permitted to finish the work he was at present doing,--and"
"then,--then, the poet-pen would be laid aside forever, chains would be"
"undone, and he would be set at liberty! Such was his fixed idea. Was he"
"glad of the prospect, he asked himself? Yes, and No! For himself he was"
glad; but in these latter days he had come to understand the thousand
"wordless wants and aspirations of mankind,--wants and aspirations to"
which only the Poet can give fitting speech; he had begun to see how
much can be done to cheer and raise and ennoble the world by even ONE
"true, brave, earnest, and unselfish worker,--and he had attained to"
such a height in sympathetic comprehension of the difficulties and
"drawbacks of others, that he had ceased to consider himself at all in"
"the question, either with regard to the Present or the immortal"

All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This
means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia. The
"shallow upland valleys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the"
"riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But"
"not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September"
being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any
"malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the"
_trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is
"moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the"
woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no
malaria there!
"The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it"
were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives
over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous
"woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of"
"hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us"
out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;
"and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the"
"black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking"
caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle
"scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The"
big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these
parts.
"Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding"
"lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the"
proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its
background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A
"black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond"
"foundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was"
"slightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern"
facilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.
"Latterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent"
control.
In recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a
fairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over
"deaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for"
"Sweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its"
"maximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving"
"Norway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,"
"though fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of"
"1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in"
"1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,"
"while the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is"
clear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.
"Norway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from"
"23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908"
"to 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,"
"as shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in"
1896.
In Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births
"over deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986"
"in a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly"
"decreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while"
"emigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in"
"1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births"
"over deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In"
"1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus"
"of births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in"
"juste_. If you would kindly lock me up, say, for three years or the"
duration of the war I should be your debtor. I have often thought that
"a prison, provided that one were allowed unlimited paper and the use"
"of a typewriter, would be the most charming of holidays--a perfect"
rest cure. There are three books in my head which I should like to
"write. Arrest me, Dawson, I implore you! Put on the handcuffs--I have"
"never been handcuffed--ring up a taxi, and let us be off to jail. You"
"will, I hope, do me the honour of lunching with me first and meeting"
my wife. She will be immensely gratified to be quit of me. It cannot
"often have happened in your lurid career, Dawson, to be welcomed with"
"genuine enthusiasm."""
"""Why did that man say that he prepared the description of the ship for"
"you?"""
"""That is what we are going to find out, and I will help you all I can."
"My reputation is like the bloom upon the peach--touch it, and it is"
gone for ever. There is a faint glimmer of the truth at the back of my
mind which may become a clear light. Did he say that he had given it
"to me personally, into my own hand?"""
"""No. He said that he was approached by a man whom he had known off and"
"on for years, a man who was employed by you in connection with"
shipyard inquiries. He was informed that this man was still employed
"by you for the same purpose now as in the past."""
"""Your case against me is thinning out, Dawson. At its best it is"
"second-hand; at its worst, the mere conjecture of a rather careless"
draughtsman. I have two things to do: first to find out the real
"seducer, who is probably also the despatcher of the parcels to the"
"late lieutenant of Northumberland Fusiliers, and second, to save if I"
can this poor fool of a shipyard draughtsman from punishment for his
dedication of Suetonius two years before; but his real purpose is to say
"something about Luther. Luther's writings, he says, have given the"
Louvain obscurants plenty of reason to inveigh against the _bonae
"literae_, to decry all scholars. He himself does not know Luther and has"
"glanced through his writings only cursorily as yet, but everyone praises"
his life. How little in accordance with theological gentleness it is to
"condemn him offhand, and that before the indiscreet vulgar! For has he"
"not proposed a dispute, and submitted himself to everybody's judgement?"
"No one has, so far, admonished, taught, convinced him. Every error is"
not at once heresy.
"The best of Christianity is a life worthy of Christ. Where we find that,"
we should not rashly suspect people of heresy. Why do we so uncharitably
"persecute the lapses of others, though none of us is free from error?"
"Why do we rather want to conquer than cure, suppress than instruct?"
"But he concludes with a word that could not but please Luther's friends,"
who so hoped for his support. 'May the duke prevent an innocent man from
being surrendered under the cloak of piety to the impiety of a few. This
"is also the wish of Pope Leo, who has nothing more at heart than that"
innocence be safe.'
At this same time Erasmus does his best to keep Froben back from
"publishing Luther's writings, 'that they may not fan the hatred of the"
_bonae literae_ still more'. And he keeps repeating: I do not know
"Luther, I have not read his writings. He makes this declaration to"
"Luther himself, in his reply to the latter's epistle of 28 March. This"
"letter of Erasmus, dated 30 May 1519, should be regarded as a newspaper"
"leader[17], to acquaint the public with his attitude towards the Luther"
question. Luther does not know the tragedies which his writings have
caused at Louvain. People here think that Erasmus has helped him in
composing them and call him the standard bearer of the party! That
"The husband died, and Mary once again donned male attire and enlisted in a"
"regiment in Holland. Soon tiring of this, she deserted, and shipped"
herself aboard a vessel bound for the West Indies. This ship was taken by
"an English pirate, Captain Rackam, and Mary joined his crew as a seaman."
"She was at New Providence Island, Bahama, when Woodes Rogers came there"
"with the royal pardon to all pirates, and she shipped herself aboard a"
privateer sent out by Rogers to cruise against the Spaniards. The crew
"mutinied and again became pirates. She now sailed under Captain Rackam,"
"who had with him another woman pirate, Anne Bonny. They took a large"
"number of ships belonging to Jamaica, and out of one of these took"
"prisoner ""a young fellow of engaging behaviour"" with whom Mary fell deeply"
"in love. This young fellow had a quarrel with one of the pirates, and as"
the ship lay at anchor they were to go to fight it out on shore according
"to pirate law. Mary, to save her lover, picked a quarrel with the same"
"pirate, and managed to have her duel at once, and fighting with sword and"
pistol killed him on the spot.
"She now married the young man ""of engaging behaviour,"" and not long after"
was taken prisoner with Captain Rackam and the rest of the crew to
"Jamaica. She was tried at St. Jago de la Vega in Jamaica, and on November"
"28th, 1720, was convicted, but died in prison soon after of a violent"
fever.
That Mary Read was a woman of great spirit is shown by her reply to
"Captain Rackam, who had asked her (thinking she was a young man) what"
"pleasure she could find in a life continually in danger of death by fire,"
"sword, or else by hanging; to which Mary replied ""that as to hanging, she"
"thought it no great Hardship, for were it not for that, every cowardly"
"Fellow would turn Pirate and so unfit the Seas, that Men of Courage must"
"starve."""
"the girls seeking orchids, nor the hunter after his prey, dared to"
trespass upon that enchanted ground.
"'What would happen,' I asked once, 'if anyone went into that wood? Would"
"he be killed, or what?'"
"And I was told that no one could tell what would happen, only that he"
"would never be seen again alive. 'The Nats would confiscate him,' they"
"said, 'for intruding on their privacy.' But what they would do to him"
after the confiscation no one seemed to be quite sure. I asked the
"official who was with me, a fine handsome Burman who had been with us in"
"many fights, whether he would go into the wood with me, but he declined"
"at once. Enemies are one thing, Nats are quite another, and a very much"
"more dreadful thing. You can escape from enemies, as witness my"
"companion, who had been shot at times without number and had only once"
"been hit, in the leg, but you cannot escape Nats. Once, he told me,"
"there were two very sacrilegious men, hunters by profession, only more"
"abandoned than even the majority of hunters, and they went into this"
"wood to hunt 'They didn't care for Nats,' they said. They didn't care"
"for anything at all apparently. 'They were absolutely without reverence,"
"worse than any beast,' said my companion."
"So they went into the wood to shoot, and they never came out again. A"
"few days later their bare bones were found, flung out upon the road near"
the enchanted wood. The Nats did not care to have even the bones of such
"scoundrels in their wood, and so thrust them out. That was what happened"
"to them, and that was what might happen to us if we went in there. We"
did not go.
Though the Nats of the forest will not allow even one of their beasts to
"be slain, the Nats of the rivers are not so exclusive. I do not think"
fish are ever regarded in quite the same light as animals. It is true
beliefs remain.
It is true that the taking of life is against Buddhist commands. No life
at all may be taken by him who adheres to Buddhistic teaching. Neither
"for sport, nor for revenge, nor for food, may any animal be deprived of"
the breath that is in it. And this is a command wonderfully well kept.
"There are a few exceptions, but they are known and accepted as breaches"
"of the law, for the law itself knows no exceptions. Fish, as I have"
"said, can be obtained almost everywhere. They are caught in great"
"quantities in the river, and are sold in most bazaars, either fresh or"
salted. It is one of the staple foods of the Burmese. But although they
"will eat fish, they despise the fisherman. Not so much, perhaps, as if"
"he killed other living things, but still, the fisherman is an outcast"
from decent society. He will have to suffer great and terrible
punishment before he can be cleansed from the sins that he daily
"commits. Notwithstanding this, there are many fishermen in Burma."
A fish is a very cold-blooded beast. One must be very hard up for
something to love to have any affection to spare upon fishes. They
"cannot be, or at all events they never are, domesticated, and most of"
them are not beautiful. I am not aware that they have ever been known to
"display any attachment to anyone, which accounts, perhaps, for the"
comparatively lenient eye with which their destruction is contemplated.
"For with warm-blooded animals it is very different. Cattle, as I have"
"said, can never be killed nor their meat sold by a Burman, and with"
other animals the difficulty is not much less.
"I was in Upper Burma for some months before the war, and many a time I"
could get no meat at all. Living in a large town among prosperous
"people, I could get no flesh at all, only fish and rice and vegetables."
"When, after much trouble, my Indian cook would get me a few fowls, he"
shameful secret.
A sound--the sound of a man in great pain checked her hysterical sobs.
"Dazed, she passed her hand over her face as if to clear away the dark"
shades that were obstructing her vision. Another groan--and like a flash
she was down on her knees lavishing endearments upon the road agent.
"Never before, it is true, had the Girl had any experience in gun-shot"
"wounds. She had played the part of nurse, however, more than once when"
the boys met with accidents at the mines. For the women of the
California camps at that time had endless calls upon them. It was a
"period for sacrifices innumerable, and help and sympathy were never"
"asked that they were not freely given. So, if the Girl did not know the"
"very best thing to do, she knew, at least, what not to do, and it was"
only a few minutes before she had cut the coat from his back.
The next thing to be done--the dragging of the unconscious man to the
"bed--was hard work, of course, but being strong of arm, as well as stout"
"of heart, she at last accomplished it."
"Now she cut away his shirt in order to find the wound, which proved to"
be in his breast. Quickly then she felt with her fingers in an endeavour
"to find the ball, but in this she was unsuccessful. So after a moment's"
deliberation she made up her mind that the wound was a flesh one and
that the ball was anywhere but in the man's body--a diagnosis that was
"largely due to the cheerful optimism of her nature and which,"
"fortunately, proved to be true."
Presently she went to a corner of the room and soon returned with a
basin of water and some hastily torn bandages. For a good fifteen
"minutes after that she washed the gash and, finally, bandaged it as well"
"as she knew how. And now, having done all that her knowledge or instinct"
know more of this man and his life held Grey’s soul in thrall.  He had
"always experienced a vivid curiosity to taste life in its various forms,"
"to know and understand the thoughts, the feelings, the aspirations, the"
ambitions of other men.  His travels had given him insight into many
matters; but he felt that these new experiences were likely to be more
"searching, more exciting, more full of keen personal interest.  He had"
"been, as it were, a spectator heretofore; now he was to be a"
participator.
He had not meant to be any man’s guest; he had meant to take a modest
"lodging of his own, and look about him for something in the way of"
"employment, but Lord Sandford had roared with laughter over such a"
notion.
"""What!  Sir Grey Dumaresq going cap in hand to some proud place-giver to"
"ask for patronage, or I know not what!  Gadzooks, man, with that face,"
"that figure, that horse, and a purse full of guineas, you can do better"
than that!  Trust yourself to me. I’ll show you where fame and fortune
lie.  You shall redeem your rat-infested old house in a very brief
"while, if you will but trust yourself to my guidance.  You be Damon to"
"my Pythias—or is it t’other way round, eh?—and I’ll show you the royal"
"road to the goal you want."""
"For lack of any definite plans, Grey had consented for the nonce to"
"accept Lord Sandford’s advice, and had quickly found himself installed"
"in some gloomy and stately yet luxurious chambers in a vast house, of"
"which only a portion was open for use, and the rest given over to a"
neglect and decay that Hartsbourne itself could scarcely rival.
"""But we shall change all that some day,"" spoke Lord Sandford, with a"
"careless laugh, as Grey expressed his surprise at the vast rooms and"
"long galleries shut up and infested by rats and spiders. ""Oh yes, we"
The change in the aspect of affairs would have made a greater difference
to most companies of adventurers than it did to that of which Master
Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the shire of Fife was the leader. In the
morning they had all risen with the expectation of being shot with the
sun-rising. At ten of the clock they were speeding southward on good
"horses, holding acknowledged rank and position in the army of the only"
Catholic and religious sovereign.
But they were a philosophic quartette. Rollo drew in the morning air and
blew it back again through his nostrils without thinking much of how
nearly he had come to kissing the brown earth of Luis Fernandez's garden
with a dozen bullets through his heart. Mortimer meditated somewhat
"sulkily upon his lost onions, rustling pleasantly back there in the cool"
_patio_ of the nunnery. Etienne sorrowed for his latest love idyll
"ruthlessly cut short, and as to El Sarria, he thought of nothing save"
that Dolóres had come back to him and that he had yet to reckon with the
Fernandez family. The next time he would attend to the whole matter
"himself, and there would be no mistakes."
It was not without sadness that Rollo looked his last on the white
walls of the convent of the Holy Innocents. He was glad indeed to have
"placed Dolóres in safety--glad that she and her child were together, and"
that the good sisters were responsible for them. Between them the four
"had made up a purse to be sent by Concha to the Mother Superior, to be"
"applied for the behoof of her guests till the better days should come,"
and Ramon Garcia be able to claim his wife and first-born son.
But Concha had refused point-blank.
"""The babe came through the wicket. The mother arrived by night, a"
"fugitive asking pity, like the Virgin fleeing down to Egypt in the"
"pictures,"" said Concha. ""The convent needs no alms, nor does the Lady"
"“Thank you,” said the girl, softly but heartily. “I am sure you need"
not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe
heels are horridly common-sense; I can’t blame them at all.”
Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.
She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.
She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a
sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair
showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament
was a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the
self-respecting working girl of the best type.
A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask
this girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but
solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury
would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady’s society. This
"girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that. And in"
spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to
sit at table with her.
"These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask"
"her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes"
wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They
were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own
"judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars,"
"discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The"
dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull
routine of the girl’s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add
to his own triumph and pleasure.
"“I think,” he said to her, with frank gravity, “that your foot needs a"
"longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which"
"After reading the letter, I felt sure that the Abbé du Boise was George"
Hamilton. I could hardly bring myself to believe that he would be so
"foolhardy as to visit Whitehall, though I knew the adventure was of a"
nature likely to appeal to his reckless disregard of consequences. I
"knew also that, if successful, he would win the reward without which"
life had little value to him.
I was sure that Hamilton had fully weighed the danger of his perilous
"mission, and that he was deliberately staking his life on a last"
desperate chance to win fortune and Frances Jennings.
"Though perhaps Lilly was a charlatan in many respects, he was to be"
trusted; still I did not feel that it was my place to impart George's
"secret to him, though I had in mind a plan whereby he might be of great"
help to the Abbé du Boise in influencing King Charles. The king consulted
"him secretly in many important affairs, and I was sure that if the good"
"Doctor should be called in by his Majesty in the Dunkirk affair, the"
stars would tell a story in accord with our desires if we made it to
Lilly's interest.
"However, all of that must wait for the Abbé du Boise. Of one thing I was"
sure; I must tell Frances at once so that she might be paving the way to
"the king with her smiles. It would be a disagreeable task, but I knew she"
"would do it gladly, and I also knew that no woman could do it better."
While I had expressed my doubts to Frances concerning Hamilton's
"emigration to Canada, I had not felt entirely sure there was nothing in"
"it, and she, womanlike, taking the worst for granted, had accepted it as"
"true. But the coming of the Abbé du Boise changed everything, and when I"
"saw her at her father's house and told her of my suspicions, and showed"
"her Le Blanc's letter, she was so greatly alarmed that she said she would"
Edward refuses hot bread at breakfast. His hostess asks whether he
"likes it. “Yes, I am extremely fond of it.” “Why did you refuse it?”"
“Because I know that my papa does not approve of my eating it. Am I to
"disobey a Father and Mother I love so well, and forget my duty, because"
"they are a long way off? I would not touch the cake, were I sure nobody"
"could see me. I myself should know it, and that would be sufficient.”"
"“Nobly replied!” exclaimed Mrs. C. “Act always thus, and you must be"
"happy, for although the whole world should refuse the praise that is"
"due, you must enjoy the approbation of your conscience, which is beyond"
anything else.”
Here is a quotation of the same kind from Mrs. Sherwood:
"“Tender-souled little creatures, desolated by a sense of sin, if"
they did but eat a spoonful of cupboard jam without Mamma's express
"permission.... Would a modern Lucy, jealous of her sister Emily's doll,"
break out thus easily into tearful apology for her guilt?--‘I know
"it is wicked in me to be sorry that Emily is happy, but I feel that"
I cannot help it.’ And would a modern mother retort with heartfelt
"joy?--'My dear child, I am glad you have confessed. Now I shall tell"
you why you feel this wicked sorrow'--proceeding to an account of the
depravity of human nature so unredeemed by comfort for a childish mind
of common intelligence that one can scarcely imagine the interview
ending in anything less tragic than a fit of juvenile hysteria.”
Description of a Good Boy. “A good boy is dutiful to his Father and
"Mother, obedient to his master and loving to his playfellows. He is"
"diligent in learning his book, and takes a pleasure in improving"
himself in everything that is worthy of praise. He rises early in
"the morning, makes himself clean and decent, and says his prayers."
"He loves to hear good advice, is thankful to those who give it and"
"But what wonder is it that little Concha, in her passionate Spanish"
"fashion understanding but one way of love, and being little interested"
"in brothers, felt the tears come to her eyes as Rollo's step waxed"
"fainter in the distance, and said over and over to herself with smiling"
"pleasure, ""He loves me--he loves me! Oh, if only my mother had lived, I"
might have been worthier of him. Then I would not have played with men's
"hearts for amusement to myself, as alas, I have too often done. God"
"forgive me, there was no harm, indeed. But--but--I am not worthy of"
"him--I know I am not!"""
So Rollo's hasty kiss on the dark balcony was provocative of a healthy
self-reproach on both sides--which at least was so much to the good.
Concha peered out into the darkness towards the south where a few stars
were blinking sleepily through the ground-mist. She could dimly discern
"the outline of the town lying piled beneath her, without a light,"
"without a sound, without a sign of life. From beyond the hills came a"
"weird booming as of a distant cannonade. But Concha, the careless maiden"
"who had grown into a woman in an hour, did not think of these things."
"For to the Spanish girl, whose heart is touched to the core, there is"
"but one subject worthy of thought. Wars, battles, sieges, the distresses"
"of queens, the danger of royal princesses--all are as nothing, because"
her lips have been kissed.
"""All the same,"" she muttered to herself, ""he ought not have done it--and"
"when I have a little recovered I will tell him so!"""
"But at that moment, poised upon the topmost spike of the great gate in"
"front of her, she saw the silhouette of a man. He was climbing upwards,"
"with his hand on the cross-bar of the railing, and cautiously"
"insinuating a leg over the barrier, feeling meanwhile gingerly for a"
foothold on the palace side.
window is playing in the middle of the square. A _jet d'eau_ indeed!!
"It may do very well for a Frenchman to call it that, but we must call"
it a perfect volcano of water. A huge column goes hissing up as high as
"a steeple, with the speed and force of a rocket, and comes down in"
"thunder, and little rainbows are flitting about in the showery spray."
"It being Sunday, every thing and person is gayer than usual. Bands are"
"playing and soldiers are parading all through the town; everything,"
"indeed, is military, and yet little is foppish--a statement which to"
English ears will sound like a direct contradiction.'
Our traveller had been given letters to certain Berlin Professors from
"young Blackie, afterwards Professor of Greek in Edinburgh University,"
who had just translated Goethe's _Faust_ into the English tongue. 'I
went about half an hour ago to call upon a sort of Professor here to
whom I had a letter and a _Faust_ to present from Blackie--found him
"ill and confined to bed--was admitted, however, very well received, and"
shall call again when I think there is a chance of his being better. I
have still another Professor to call on with a letter and book from
"Blackie, and there my acquaintance with the society of Berlin is likely"
to terminate.' One other introduction to Ferrier on this expedition to
"Germany is mentioned in a note from his aunt, Miss Susan Ferrier, the"
only letter to her nephew that has apparently been preserved: whether
"or not he availed himself of the offer, history does not record. It"
runs as follows:--
"'EDINR., _1st August_."
'I could not get a letter to Lord Corehouse's German sister
"(Countess Purgstall), as it seems she is in bad health, and not fit"
to entertain vagabonds; but I enclose a very kind one from my
"friend, Mrs. Erskine, to the ambassadress at Munich, and if you"
"don't go there you may send it by post, as it will be welcome at"
up with a typewriter at which the military clerk sat tapping. The
Colonel's personal luggage had been placed in his bedroom. A soldier
was even sweeping up all traces of the invasion of armed men and
making everything tidy. It all seemed like a horrid dream that was
going to end up happily after all. Presently Vivie would wake up
"completely and there would even be no Oberst, no orderly; only the"
peaceful life of the farm that was going on yesterday. Here a sound
of angry voices interrupted her musings. The cows returning by
themselves from the pasture were being intercepted by soldiers who
were trying to secure them. Vivie in her indignation ran out and
"ordered the soldiers off, in English. To her surprise they obeyed"
"silently, but as they sauntered away to their quarters she was"
saddened at seeing them carrying the bodies of most of the turkeys
and fowls and even the corpse of the poor tailless peacock. They had
waited for sundown to rob the hen-roosts.
Very much disillusioned she ran to the morning room and burst in on
"the Colonel's dictation to his clerk. ""Excuse me, but if you don't"
keep your soldiers in better order you will have very little to eat
whilst you are here. They are killing and carrying off all our
"poultry."""
The Colonel flushed a little at the peremptory way in which she
"spoke, but without replying went out and shouted a lot of orders in"
German. His orderly summoned soldiers from the barn and together
they drove the cows into the cow-sheds. All the Flemish servants
"having disappeared in a panic, the Germans had to milk the cows that"
"evening; and Vivie, assisted by the orderly, cooked the evening"
"meal in the kitchen. He was, like his Colonel, a Saxon, a"
"pleasant-featured, domesticated man, who explained civilly in the"
Thuringian dialect--though to Vivie there could be no discrimination
"between varieties of High German--that the Sachsen folk were ""Eines"
"The Captain's eyes were alight with happiness, and his face red with"
"excitement.  He worked upon Vaviloff's greed, and urging upon him the"
"importance of immediate action in the matter, went away in a very"
joyful and happy frame of mind.
*      *      *      *      *
"In the evening everyone was told of the Captain's discovery, and they"
"all began to discuss Petunikoff's future predicament, painting in vivid"
colours his excitement and astonishment on the day the court messenger
handed him the copy of the summons.  The Captain felt himself quite a
hero.  He was happy and all his friends highly pleased. The heap of
dark and tattered figures that lay in the courtyard made noisy
"demonstrations of pleasure. They all knew the merchant, Petunikoff, who"
"passed them very often, contemptuously turning up his eyes and giving"
them no more attention than he bestowed on the other heaps of rubbish
"lying on the ground.  He was well fed, and that exasperated them still"
more; and now how splendid it was that one of themselves had struck a
hard blow at the selfish merchant's purse!  It gave them all the
greatest pleasure.  The Captain's discovery was a powerful instrument
in their hands.  Every one of them felt keen animosity towards all
"those who were well fed and well dressed, but in some of them this"
feeling was only beginning to develop. Burning interest was felt by
"those ""creatures that once were men"" in the prospective fight between"
"Kuvalda and Petunikoff, which they already saw in imagination."
For a fortnight the inhabitants of the dosshouse awaited the further
"development of events, but Petunikoff never once visited the building."
It was known that he was not in town and that the copy of the petition
had not yet been handed to him.  Kuvalda raged at the delays of the
civil court.  It is improbable that anyone had ever awaited the
merchant with such impatience as did this bare-footed brigade.
"There was a woman once who loved a young man, not of her village, very"
"dearly. And he loved her, too, as dearly as she loved him, and he"
demanded her in marriage from her parents; but they refused. Why they
"refused I do not know, but probably because they did not consider the"
young man a proper person for their daughter to marry. Then he tried to
"run away with her, and nearly succeeded, but they were caught before"
they got clear of the village.
The young man had to leave the neighbourhood. The attempted abduction of
"a girl is an offence severely punishable by law, so he fled; and in"
"time, under pressure from her people, the girl married another man; but"
she never forgot. She lived with her husband quite happily; he was good
"to her, as most Burmese husbands are, and they got along well enough"
together. But there were no children.
"After some years, four or five, I believe, the former lover returned to"
his village. He thought that after this lapse of time he would be safe
"from prosecution, and he was, moreover, very ill."
"He was so ill that very soon he died, without ever seeing again the girl"
he was so fond of; and when she heard of his death she was greatly
"distressed, so that the desire of life passed away from her. It so"
happened that at this very time she found herself enceinte with her
"first child, and not long before the due time came for the child to be"
born she had a dream.
"She dreamt that her soul left her body, and went out into space and met"
there the soul of her lover who had died. She was rejoiced to meet him
"again, full of delight, so that the return of her soul to her body, her"
"awakening to a world in which he was not, filled her with despair. So"
"she prayed her lover, if it was now time for him again to be incarnated,"

better until they put a real computer on every ship and tell the

"""I hope so--but say, Steve, I'm worried about using that much plus"

"""I'll say they will. I know just how the passengers will howl if we"
"hold them weightless for half an hour, waiting for those two moons to get"
"out of the way, and I know just what the manager will do if we check in"
"minus thirty-one minutes. Wow! He'll swell up and bust, sure. But don't"
"worry, Breck--if we don't check in all right, anybody can have my head"
"that wants it, and I'm taking full responsibility, you know."""
"""You're welcome to it."" Breckenridge shrugged and turned the"
"conversation into a lighter vein. ""Speaking of weightlessness,"
"it's funny how many weight-fiends there are in the world, isn't"
it? You'd think the passengers would enjoy a little weightlessness
"occasionally--especially the fat ones--but they don't. But say, while"
"I think of it, how come you were here and loose to make this check-up?"
"I thought you were out with the other two of the Big Three, solving"
"all the mysteries of the Universe?"""
found herself skirting the high-paled ironwork which confines the
"palace. She pursued her way towards the town, taking care, however, to"
look sharply about her so that she might miss nothing.
"The palace grounds seemed utterly deserted. The fountains slept; ""Fame"""
drove no longer her waters fifty yards into the air; the Frogs rested
from their ungrateful labours open-mouthed and gasping for breath. Not
"even a gardener was to be seen scratching weeds on a path, or in the"
dimmest distance passing at random across one of the deep-shaded
"avenues. An unholy quiet seemed to have settled upon the place, the"
"marvel of Castile, the most elevated of earthly palaces, broken only by"
"the sombre tolling of the chapel bell, which would cease for five"
"minutes without apparent reason, and then, equally without cause, begin"
all over again its lugubrious chime.
"Down the zigzags towards the town went La Giralda, the goats taking"
"advantage of the wider paths to stray further afield, and needing more"
"frequently the touch of the wand, which the old woman had taken from the"
donkey's load in order to induce them to proceed.
"As the gipsy passed along, a small shrill voice called upon her to stop,"
"and from a side walk, concealed by roses and oleander bushes, late"
"flowering because of the great elevation, a richly-dressed little girl"
came running. She ran at the top of her speed towards the gilt railings
which towered high above her head. Her age appeared to be about that of
the little girl whom La Giralda had buried among the pottery shards in
that other meaner garden up on the mountain side.
"""Stop,"" she cried imperiously, ""I bid you stop! I am the Queen, and you"
must obey me. I have not seen any one for five days except stupid old

no evil.
"The king was rather abashed that his design had been discovered, but he"
was firm in his purpose. He assured the queen that the blacksmith should
"come to no harm, but rather good; and he ordered the queen to obey him,"
threatening her that if she refused he would be sure that she was
"disloyal also, and there would be no alternative but to send and arrest"
"the blacksmith by force, and punish her, the queen, too. Then the queen"
said that if the king swore to her that her brother should come to no
"harm, she would write as ordered. _And the king swore._"
"So the queen wrote to her brother, and adjured him by his love to her to"
"come down to the Golden City. She said she had dire need of him, and she"
told him that the king had sworn that no harm should come to him.
The letter was sent off by a king's messenger. In due time the
"blacksmith arrived, and he was immediately seized and thrown into prison"
to await his trial.
"When the queen saw that she had been deceived, she was in despair. She"
"tried by every way, by tears and entreaties and caresses, to move the"
"king, but all without avail. Then she tried by plotting and bribery to"
"gain her brother's release, but it was all in vain. The day for trial"
"came quickly, and the blacksmith was tried, and he was condemned and"
sentenced to be burnt alive by the river on the following day.
On the evening of the day of trial the queen sent a message to the king
"to come to her; and when the king came reluctantly, fearing a renewal of"
"entreaties, expecting a woman made of tears and sobs, full of grief, he"
found instead that the queen had dried her eyes and dressed herself
"still more beautifully than ever, till she seemed to the king the very"

Dawson in the office and the genuine article will be out on the
"rampage. He is a man who couldn't sit still, not even if you tied him"
"in his chair and sealed the knots."""
We spent a pleasant hour pulling Dawson to pieces and leaving to him
"not a rag of virtue, except intense professional zeal. We exchanged"
"experiences of him, those of the chief assistant being particularly"
rich and highly flavoured. It appeared that Dawson when off duty loved
to occupy the platform at meetings of his religious connection and to
"hold forth to the elect. The privilege of ""sitting under him"" had been"
"enjoyed more than once by the assistant, who retailed to us extracts"
"from Dawson's favourite sermon on ""Truth."" His views upon Truth were"
"unbending as armour plate. ""Under no circumstances, not to save"
"oneself from imminent death, not to shield a wife or a child from the"
"penalties for a lapse from virtue, not even to preserve one's country"
"from the attacks of an enemy, was it permissible to a Peculiar Baptist"
to diverge by the breadth of a hair from the straight path of Truth.
Hell yawned on either hand; only along the knife edge of Truth could
"salvation be reached."""
"""He made me shiver,"" said the chief assistant, ""and he drove me to"
thinking of one or two little deceptions of my own. When Dawson
"preaches, his eyes blaze, his voice breaks, and he will fall on his"
knees and pray for the souls of those who heed not his words. You
can't look at him then and not believe that he means every word he
"says. Yet it's all humbug."""
"""No, it is not,"" said I. ""Dawson in the pulpit, or on the tub--or"
whatever platform he uses--is absolutely genuine. He is the finest

He did. Fortunately Tweedy held his power of attorney with the right to
"sign checks and execute papers of any sort, so it was possible for him"
to put through these deals without his returning to Bangor. That another
note for nearly as much as the first fell due in little more than a

miles or so above Bangor. And it is always possible to raise money on
"timber, even in the rough."
"Of course, if the trust continued their campaign of cutting prices Bob’s"
"plans would be materially affected. He could not believe, however, that"
they would do such a thing for any great length of time. A dollar meant
"as much to them as to any one, and even the pleasure of ruining a"
competitor would scarcely compensate for the loss of so much money.
A long letter of instruction and explanation was written to Tweedy that
"night, and despatched the first thing in the morning by the trusty hand"
"of Joe Moose, the Indian. That off his mind, Bob returned to his drive"
"with renewed vigor, for the necessity for haste was now even greater"
than before. It was a question of getting the logs down in double-quick
time or being dragged into the bankruptcy court; and that sort of
notoriety did not appeal in the least to the young man.
It was this feeling of necessity which got Bob up next morning before
the blackness of the night was more than faintly tinged by streaks of
pale gray in the east. He wanted to be off and doing; even necessary
inaction chafed. It seemed an eternity before the men had finished
"narrow one in Harpe Alley, leading from Shoe Lane.  It was not an old"
"house, for it came within the area of the great fire of fifty years"
"back, and had been rebuilt, like the whole of the surrounding buildings,"
with greater speed than discretion.  Grey had once come across Sir
"Christopher Wren in his other life, and had talked with him of the"
short-sighted policy observed in the rebuilding of the city.  The great
"architect declared that had his plans been carried out, London would"
have been the finest city in the world: but the haste and false economy
"of the citizens and city companies had thwarted his plans, and the old"
"lines of narrow and crooked streets were kept as before, to the cost of"
succeeding generations.
"This house had been hastily run up, like those surrounding it, and the"
tempest from without rattled and shook the walls and windows as though
"to drive them in.  But the room itself, though no more than an attic,"
"bore an air of comfort very pleasant to the eyes of the homeless Grey,"
whose own quarters only contained the barest necessities of life; for
"there were some rough shelves full of books in one corner, and a rug"
before the fire gave a look of comfort to the place.  Two armchairs of
"rude pattern, but furnished with down cushions, seemed to invite repose;"
"and everything was scrupulously clean, even to the boards of the floor."
"""’A poor thing, but mine own,’"" spoke the Old Lion, with his grim smile,"
"as he motioned to Grey to take one chair, and he himself pulled up the"
"other. ""I have dwelt here two years and more now, and I have not been"
"unhappy; albeit I never thought to end my days in a garret, as belike I"
"shall do now."""
"""Fortune has been hard upon you,"" spoke Grey earnestly.  ""You have the"
gifts and the powers; it is cruel that your limbs should have become
"crippled."""
"I knew then, if never before, that there could be no happiness in this"
world for her away from him. Whether she would find it with him was
"impossible for me to know, but I saw that she was in the grip of a mighty"
"passion, and I could only hope that a way would open to save her."
Hamilton's fortunes would need to mend a great deal before he could
"or would ask her to be his wife, for now he was at the bottom of the"
ladder. He lost no opportunity to impress this disagreeable truth upon
"her, but his honest efforts to hold himself aloof only increased her"
respect and love for him. It not only convinced her that notwithstanding
"his past life, he was a man of honor capable of resisting himself and of"
"protecting her, but it gave him the quality so irresistible to a"
woman--unattainability.
"Taking it all in all, my poor beautiful cousin was falling day by"
day deeper into an abyss of love from which she could in no way
"extricate herself. In short, level-headed Frances had got far out"
"of plumb, and, though she struggled desperately, she could not right"
"herself, nor could any one help her. I fully realized that the small"
amount of self-restraint and passivity she still retained would give
way to disastrous activity when the time should come for her to part
with George and lose him forever. But I could see no way to save her
"unless I could induce George to leave England at once, for good and"
all.
"At times the fates seem to fly to a man's help, and in this instance they"
"came to me most graciously that same day in Whitehall, in the person of"
my friend the Count de Grammont.
"Soon after leaving Frances in the maids' apartments, I met that most"
"interesting gentleman roué, his Grace de Grammont, coming from the king's"
"closet. As already stated, he had been banished from the French court by"
"a gardener, not a dog, not even a soldier on guard to salute me or let"
"me examine his sword-bayonet. And now when this dear, this sweet old"
"Señora comes by with her lovely, lovely goats, you must perforce try to"
pull me off as if I were a village child that had played truant from the
"monks' school and must be birched for its fault!"""
"All the while she was speaking, the young Princess directed a shower of"
"harmless blows at the skirts of her attendant, which Doña Susana"
"laughingly warded off, begging all the while for pity, and instancing"
"the direct commands of the little girl's mother, apparently a very"
"exalted personage indeed, as a reason for her interference."
"But Isabel of Spain was not to be appeased, and presently she had"
recourse to tears in the midst of her fury.
"""You hate me--I know you do--that is what it means,"" she cried, ""you"
"would not have me happy even for a moment. But one day I shall be Queen,"
"and do as I like! Yes, and drink as much warm goat's milk as I want, in"
"spite of all the stupid, wicked, cruel Susanas in the world. And I shall"
throw you into a dungeon with nothing but mice and rats and serpents and
"centipedes--yes, and snails that leave a white slimy trail over you"
"when they crawl! Ugh! And I will have your hands tied, so that you shall"
"not be able to brush them off when they tickle your neck. Yes, I will,"
"Susana! I swear it, and I am growing big--so big! And soon I shall be"
"old enough to have you put in prison with the mice and snails, bad"
"Susana! Oh, wicked Susana!"""
"Now, whether these childish threats actually had some effect, or whether"
"the old lady was so soft-hearted as her comfortable appearance denoted,"
certain it is that she took a key from her pocket and passed it through
the tall gilt railings to La Giralda.
involved in a series of polemics. To let the opposition of opponents
"pass unnoticed was forbidden not only by his character, for ever"
"striving to justify himself in the eyes of the world, but also by the"
"custom of his time, so eager for dispute."
"There were, first of all, his polemics with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples,"
"or in Latinized form, Faber Stapulensis, the Parisian theologian, who as"
"a preparer of the Reformation may, more than anyone else, be ranked with"
Erasmus. At the moment when Erasmus got into the travelling cart which
"was to take him to Louvain, a friend drew his attention to a passage in"
"the new edition of Faber's commentary on St. Paul's epistles, in which"
"he controverted Erasmus's note on the Second Epistle to the Hebrews,"
"verse 7. Erasmus at once bought Faber's book, and soon published an"
"_Apologia_. It concerned Christ's relation to God and the angels, but"
"the dogmatic point at issue hinged, after all, on a philological"
interpretation of Erasmus.
"Not yet accustomed to much direct wrangling, Erasmus was violently"
"agitated by the matter, the more as he esteemed Faber highly and"
considered him a congenial spirit. 'What on earth has occurred to the
man? Have others set him on against me? All theologians agree that I am
"right,' he asserts. It makes him nervous that Faber does not reply again"
at once. Badius has told Peter Gilles that Faber is sorry about it.
Erasmus in a dignified letter appeals to their friendship; he will
suffer himself to be taught and censured. Then again he growls: Let him
be careful. And he thinks that his controversy with Faber keeps the
world in suspense: there is not a meal at which the guests do not side
with one or the other of them. But finally the combat abated and the
friendship was preserved.
"Towards Easter 1518, Erasmus contemplated a new journey to Basle, there"
"to pass through the press, during a few months of hard labour, the"
"it than anybody else except God 'lmighty. If the fish hug the shore,"
"then we're up against it, but I think they strike in about here; that's"
"why I chose this site. We can't tell, though, till the run starts. All"
"we can do now is see that them people keep their distance."""
"The ""lead"" of a salmon-trap consists of a row of web-hung piling that"
"runs out from the shore for many hundred feet, forming a high, stout"
fence that turns the schools of fish and leads them into cunningly
"contrived enclosures, or ""pounds,"" at the outer extremity, from which"
"they are ""brailed"" as needed. These corrals are so built that once the"
fish are inside they cannot escape. The entire structure is devised
"upon the principle that the salmon will not make a short turn, but will"
swim as nearly as possible in a straight line. It looked to Boyd as if
"Marsh, by blocking the line of progress above and below, had virtually"
"destroyed the efficiency of the new trap, rendering the cost of its"
construction a total loss.
"""Sometimes you can cork a trap and sometimes you can't,"" Balt went on."
"""It all depends on the currents, the lay of the bars, and a lot of"
things we don't know nothing about. I've spent years in trying to
"locate the point where them fish strike in, and I think it's just below"
"here. It'll all depend on how good I guessed."""
"""Exactly! And if you guessed wrong--"""
"""Then we'll fish with nets, like we used to before there was any traps."""
"That evening, when he had seen the night-shift started, Emerson decided"
"to walk up to Cherry's house, for he was worried over the day's"
developments and felt that an hour of the girl's society might serve to
clear his thoughts. His nerves were high-strung from the tension of the
"past weeks, and he knew himself in the condition of an athlete trained"

"are apt to be associated with somnambulism, points out that when the"

"(_British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899, p. 465). An interesting"
study of movement in normal and morbid sleep has been contributed by
"Segre ('Contributo alla Conoscenza dei Movimenti del Sonno,' _Archivio di"
"Psichiatria_, 1907, fasc. 1.).]"
"[Footnote 78: This question is, for instance, asked by F. H. Bradley ('On"
"the Failure of Movement in Dreams,' _Mind_, 1894, p. 373). The explanation"
he prefers is that the dream vision is out of relation to the very dimly
"conscious actual position of the body, so that the information necessary"
to complete the idea of the movement is wanting. Only as regards the less
"complicated movements of lips, tongue, or finger, when the motor idea is"
"in harmony with the actual position of the body movements, does movement"
take place. We have no means of distinguishing the real world from the
world of our vision; 'our images thus move naturally to realise themselves
in the world of our real limbs. But the world and its arrangement is for
"the moment out of connection with our ideas, and hence the attempt at"
motion for the most part must fail.' It is quite true that this conflict
"is an important factor in dreaming, but it fails to apply to the large"
number of movements which we dream of actually doing.]
[Footnote 79: The action of some drugs produces a state in this respect
resembling that which prevails in dreams. 'Under the influence of a large
"dose of haschisch,' Professor Stout remarks (_Analytic Psychology_, vol."
"i. p. 14), 'I found myself totally unable to distinguish between what"
"I actually did and saw, and what I merely thought about.' Not only are"
"the motor and sensory activities relatively dormant, but the central"
"activity is perfectly able, and content, to dispense with their services."
"'Thought,' as Jastrow says (_Fact and Fable in Psychology_, p. 386), 'is"
"that fate which should transform it into a chaos of rotting remains,"
and finally into dust.
"The gates were open, one half of them displaced and lying on the ground"
"at the entrance, while between its bars had grown the grass, which also"
covered the large and empty court-yard.  In the depths of this yard
"stood a low, iron-roofed, smoke-begrimed building.  The house itself"
"was of course unoccupied, but this shed, formerly a blacksmith's forge,"
"was now turned into a ""dosshouse,"" kept by a retired Captain named"
Aristid Fomich Kuvalda.
"In the interior of the dosshouse was a long, wide and grimy board,"
measuring some 28 by 70 feet.  The room was lighted on one side by four
"small square windows, and on the other by a wide door.  The unpainted"
"brick walls were black with smoke, and the ceiling, which was built of"
"timber, was almost black.  In the middle stood a large stove, the"
"furnace of which served as its foundation, and around this stove and"
"along the walls were also long, wide boards, which served as beds for"
"the lodgers.  The walls smelt of smoke, the earthen floor of dampness,"
and the long wide board of rotting rags.
"The place of the proprietor was on the top of the stove, while the"
boards surrounding it were intended for those who were on good terms
with the owner and who were honoured by his friendship.  During the day
"the captain passed most of his time sitting on a kind of bench, made by"
"himself by placing bricks against the wall of the courtyard, or else in"
"the eating house of Egor Vavilovitch, which was opposite the house,"
where he took all his meals and where he also drank vodki.
"Before renting this house, Aristid Kuvalda had kept a registry office"
for servants in the town.  If we look further back into his former
"life, we shall find that he once owned printing works, and previous to"
"I do not know if this be a paradox, I know that it is a truth."
There was one point that puzzled me for a time in some of these stories
"of transmigration, such as the one I told about the man and wife being"
"reborn twins. It was this: A man dies and leaves behind children, let us"
"say, to whom he is devoutly attached. He is reborn in another family in"
"the same village, maybe. It would be natural to suppose that he would"
"love his former family as much as, or even more than, his new one."
Complications might arise in this way which it is easy to conceive would
cause great and frequent difficulties.
"I explained this to a Burman one day, and asked him what happened, and"
"this is what he said: 'The affection of mother to son, of husband to"
"wife, of brother to sister, belongs entirely to the body in which you"
"may happen to be living. When it dies, so do these affections. New"
"affections arise from the new body. The flesh of the son, being of one"
"with his father, of course loves him; but as his present flesh has no"
"sort of connection with his former one, he does not love those to whom"
he was related in his other lives. These affections are as much a part
of the body as the hand or the eyesight; with one you put off the
other.'
"Thus all love, to the learned, even the purest affection of daughter to"
"mother, of man to his friend, is in theory a function of the body--with"
"the one we put off the other; and this may explain, perhaps, something"
"of what my previous chapter did not make quite clear, that in the"
hereafter[2] of Buddhism there is no affection.
"When we have put off all bodies, when we have attained Nirvana, love and"
"hate, desire and repulsion, will have fallen from us for ever."
"Meanwhile, in each life, we are obliged to endure the affections of the"
very name of Elleray breathes of poetry and romance. Our father and
"mother had, of course, known it in its glorious prime, when our"
"grandfather, ""Christopher North,"" wrestled with dalesmen, strolled in"
his slippers with Wordsworth to Keswick (a distance of seventeen
"miles), and kept his ten-oared barge in the long drawing-room of"
"Elleray. In these days they had ""rich company,"" and the names of"
"Southey, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and Coleridge were to them familiar"
"household words. The cottage my mother was born in still stands,"
overshadowed by a giant sycamore.'
We can easily imagine the effect which society such as this would have
"on a young man's mind. But more than that, the friendship with the"
"attractive cousin, Margaret Wilson, developed into something warmer,"
"and an engagement was finally formed, which culminated in his marriage"
in 1837. Not many of James Ferrier's letters to his cousin during the
long engagement have been preserved; the few that are were written from
"Germany in 1834, the year in which he went to Heidelberg; they were"
"addressed to Thirlstane House, near Selkirk, where Miss Wilson was"
"residing, and they give a lively account of his adventures."
"The voyage from Leith to Rotterdam, judging from the first letter"
"written from Heidelberg, and dated August 1834, would appear to have"
begun in inauspicious fashion. Ferrier writes: 'I have just been here a
"week, and would have answered your letter sooner, had it not been that"
I wished to make myself tolerably well acquainted with the surrounding
"scenery before writing to you, and really the heat has been so"
"overwhelming that I have been impelled to take matters leisurely, and"
have not even yet been able to get through so much _view-hunting_ as I
should have wished. What I have seen I will endeavour to describe to
"you. This place itself is most delightful, and the country about it is"
"magnificent. But this, as a reviewer would say, _by way of"
"anticipation_. Have patience, and in the meantime let me take events in"
of Press Censor and officer in charge of Publicity. After the
"occupation of Brussels and the fall of Antwerp, the ""patriotic"""
Belgian Press had withdrawn itself to France and England or had
stopped publication. Its newspapers had been invited to continue
"their functions as organs of news-distribution and public opinion,"
but of course under the German Censorate and martial law. As one
"editor said to a polite German official: ""If I were to continue the"
"publication of my paper under such conditions, my staff and I would"
"all be shot in a week."""
But the large towns of Belgium could not be left without a Press.
"Public Opinion must be guided, and might very well be guided in a"
direction favourable to German policy. The German Government had
"already introduced the German hour into Belgian time, the German"
"coinage, the German police system, and German music; but it had no"
"intention, seemingly, of forcing the German speech on the old"
"dominions of the House of Burgundy. On the contrary, in their tenure"
"of Belgium or of North-east France, the Germans seemed desirous of"
"showing how well they wrote the French language, how ready they were"
under a German regime to give it a new literature. Whether or not
"they enlisted a few recreants, or made use of Alsatians or"
"Lorrainers to help them, it is never-the-less remarkable how free as"
a rule their written and printed French was from mistakes or German
idioms; though their spoken French always remained Alsatian. It
suffered from that extraordinary misplacement and exchange in the
upper and lower consonants which has distinguished the German
people--that nation of great philologists--since the death of the
"Roman Empire. German officers still said ""Barton, die fous brie,"""
"instead of ""Pardon, je vous prie"" (if they were polite), but they"
were quite able to contribute _articles de fond_ to a pretended
national Belgian press. Besides there was a sufficiency of Belgian
"""Sans-Patries"" ready to come to their assistance: Belgian nationals"
facing these two villages. But the specimens found in Sanaroa are
"much better in colour, and I think more easily procured. The fishing"
"in this latter locality, however, is done by the Sinaketans only."
"Whether the fishing is done in their own Lagoon, near an uninhabited"
"island called Nanoula, or in Sanaroa, it is always a big, ceremonial"
"affair, in which the whole community takes part in a body. The"
"magic, or at least part of it, is done for the whole community by"
"the magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma), who also fixes the"
"dates, and conducts the ceremonial part of the proceedings. As the"
spondylus shell furnishes one of the essential episodes of a Kula
"expedition, a detailed account both of fishing and of manufacturing"
"must be here given. The native name, kaloma (in the Southern Massim"
districts the word sapi-sapi is used) describes both the shell and
"the manufactured discs. The shell is the large spondylus shell,"
"containing a crystalline layer of a red colour, varying from dirty"
"brick-red to a soft, raspberry pink, the latter being by far the most"
"prized. It lives in the cavities of coral outcrop, scattered among"
shallow mud-bottomed lagoons.
"This shell is, according to tradition, associated with the village"
"of Sinaketa. According to a Sinaketan legend, once upon a time, three"
"guya'u (chief) women, belonging to the Tabalu sub-clan of the Malasi"
"clan, wandered along, each choosing her place to settle in. The eldest"
selected the village of Omarakana; the second went to Gumilababa;
"the youngest settled in Sinaketa. She had kaloma discs in her basket,"
"and they were threaded on a long, thin stick, called viduna, such"
as is used in the final stage of manufacture. She remained first
"in a place called Kaybwa'u, but a dog howled, and she moved further"
"on. She heard again a dog howling, and she took a kaboma (wooden plate)"
and went on to the fringing reef to collect shells. She found there
"the momoka (white spondylus), and she exclaimed: ""Oh, this is the"
"""Oh, if I could only save him, Lois! He was the first man I had ever"
"met whom I trusted, the first to trust me. I owe him everything, the"
little that is good in me. It had to come to life when he believed in
"it so implicitly. And he owes me ruin, outward and inward ruin."""
"Lois made no answer. With a warm, impulsive gesture she put her arms"
"about the taller woman's neck and, drawing the beautiful face down to"
"her own, kissed her. Beatrice responded, and thus a friendship was"
"sealed--not for life but for death, whose grim cordon was with every"
moment being drawn closer about them.
The sound of firing had now grown incessant. One report followed
"another at swift, irregular intervals, and each sounded like a clap of"
"thunder in the silent room. Mrs. Cary stirred uneasily in her sleep, a"
"low, scarcely audible groan escaped the parted lips, as though even in"
her dreams she was being pursued by fear's pitiless phantom. Her
"self-appointed nurse continued to fan her with the energy of despair,"
the poor livid face twitching at every fresh threatening sound. Mrs.
"Carmichael still pretended to be absorbed in her pinafore, but the"
"revolver lay on the table, ready to hand, and there was a look in the"
steady eyes which boded ill for the first enemy who should confront
her. Lois and Beatrice continued their fruitless task.
A woman's courage is the supreme victory of mind over matter. It is no
easy thing for a hero to sit still and helpless while death rattles
his bullet fingers against the walls and screams in voices of hate and
fury from a distance which every minute diminishes. For a woman
"burdened with the disability of a high-strung nervous system, it is a"
"martyrdom. Yet these women, brought up on the froth of an enervating,"
"pleasure-seeking society, held out--held out with a martyr's courage"
"and constancy--against the torture of inactivity, of an imagination"
[her trained nurse] says I am tucked up for the night and can have no
"receptions, levees, or interviews. I tell her she will lose her title"
"and become the Kommon Kat; but she does n't seem to mind. Oh, it's just"
lovely to feel that you 're in the house again. S._
"Risca looked round the dainty room, his whenever he chose to occupy it,"
"and knew how much, especially of late, it held of Stellamaris. It had"
"been redecorated a short while before, and the colours and the patterns"
and all had been her choice and specification.
"The castle architect, a young and fervent soul called Wratislaw, a"
"member of the Art Workers' Guild, and a friend of Herold's, who had"
"settled in Southcliff-on-Sea, and was building, for the sake of a"
"precarious livelihood, hideous bungalows which made his own heart sick,"
"but his clients' hearts rejoice, had been called in to advise. With"
"Stellamaris, sovereign lady of the house, aged fifteen, he had spent"
hours of stupefied and aesthetic delight. He had brought her armfuls of
"designs, cartloads of illustrated books; and the result of it all was"
"that, with certain other redecorations in the house with which for"
"the moment we have no concern, Risca's room was transformed from"
late-Victorian solidity into early-Georgian elegance. The Adam Brothers
"reigned in ceiling and cornice, and the authentic spirit of Sheraton,"
"thanks to the infatuated enterprise of Wratislaw, pervaded the"
"furniture. Yet, despite Wratislaw, although through him she had spoken,"
the presence of Stellamaris pervaded the room. On the writing-table lay
"a leather-covered blotter, with his initials, J. R., stamped in gold. In"
"desperate answer to a childish question long ago, he had described the"
bedspread on his Parian marble bed in the palace as a thing of rosebuds
and crinkly ribbons tied up in true-lovers' knots. On his bed in
Stella's house lay a spread exquisitely Louis XV in design.
"Risca looked about the room. Yes, everything was Stella. And behold"
imagination by linking her life finally with his?--It is a perfectly
simple explanation of what some credulous souls might be inclined to
"consider a mystery,--and let the dear, wise, oracular people who cannot"
"admit any mystery in anything, and who love to trace all seeming"
"miracles to clever imposture, accept this elucidation by all"
"means,--they will be able to fit every incident of the story into such"
"an hypothesis, with most admirable and consecutive neatness! Al-Kyris"
"was truly a Vision,--the rest was,--What? Merely the working of a"
poetic imagination under mesmeric influence!
"So be it! The Poet knows the truth,--but what are Poets? Only the"
"Prophets and Seers! Only the Eyes of Time, which clearly behold"
"Heaven's Fact beyond this world's Fable. Let them sing if they choose,"
"and we will hear them in our idle hours,--we will give them a little of"
"our gold,--a little of our grudging praise, together with much of our"
private practical contempt and misprisal! So say the unthinking and
"foolish--so will they ever say,--and hence it is, that though the fame"
"of Theos Alwyn widens year by year, and his sweet clarion harp of Song"
"rings loud warning, promise, hope, and consolation above the noisy"
"tumult of the whirling age, people listen to him merely in vague"
"wonderment and awe, doubting his prophet utterance, and loth to put"
"away their sin. But he, never weary in well-doing, works on, ... ever"
"regardless of Self, caring nothing for Fame, but giving all the riches"
"of his thought for Love. Clear, grand, pure, and musical, his writings"
"fill the time with hope and passionate faith and courage,--his"
"inspiration fails not, and can never fail, since Edris is his fount of"
"ecstasy,--his name, made glorious by God's blessing, shall never, as in"
"his perished Past, be again forgotten!"
"And what of Edris? What of the ""Flower-crowned Wonder"" of the Field of"
"Ardath, strayed for a while out of her native Heaven? Does the world"
"know her marvellous origin? Perhaps the mystic Heliobas knows,--perhaps"
"anything, risk anything, and suffer anything to shield her from the"
"filthy Germans, I rejoice that she has in her service such supremely"
efficient guardians as this most wickedly unscrupulous Dawson. There
"is, at any rate, not a trace of our English muddle about him."""
"""Ours is a righteous cause,"" cried poor Cary desperately. ""We are"
"fighting for right against wrong, for defence against aggression, for"
civilisation against utter barbarism. We are by instinct clean
"fighters. If in the stress of conflict we stoop to foul methods, can"
we ever wash away the filth of them from our souls? We shall stand
before the world nakedly confessed as the nation of hypocrites we have
"always been declared to be."""
"""Cary,"" I said, ""you make me tired. We cannot be too thankful that we"
"possess Dawsons to counterplot against the Germans, and that"
personally we are in no way responsible for the morality of their
methods. Come off the roof and get back to this most interesting
"affair of the _Antinous_. I presume one of Dawson's men was working,"
"unknown to his fellows, with the care and maintenance party, and"
"another, equally unknown, with the engineers who were busy upon the"
gearing of the turbines. Many of the regular ship's officers and men
would also have been on board. Had our remarkable friend his agents
among them too? Everything is possible with Dawson; I should not be
"surprised to hear that he had police officers in the Fleet flagship."""
"""You are almost right. One of his men, a temporary petty officer of"
"R.N.V.R., was certainly on board, and he tells me that down in the"
engine room was another--a civilian fitter. They were both first-class
"men. The electric wires, as you know, are carried about the ship under"
"the deck beams, where they are accessible for examination and repairs."
"They are coiled in cables from which wires are led to the switch room,"
"and thence to all parts of the ship. There are thousands of wires, and"
"nursing, not to speak of some excellent whisky that she happened to have"
"stored away in her cabin, had pulled him through. With a sigh of relief"
she threw herself down on the rug for a much-needed rest.
"The man woke just before the sun rose. His first thought, that he was"
"home in the foothills, was dissipated by the sight of the snow ranges."
"Through the window of the cabin, as far as the eye could see, nothing of"
"green was visible. Snow was everywhere; everything was white, save at"
the eastern horizon where silver was fast changing into rose and rose to
a fiery red as the fast-rising sun sent its shafts over the snow-coated
mountains.
And now there came to him a full realisation of what had happened and
"where he was. To his amazement, though, he was almost without pain. That"
"his wound had been dressed he was, of course, well aware for when he"
attempted to draw back still further the curtain at the window the
"movement strained the tight bandage, and he was instantly made conscious"
of a twinge of pain.
"Nevertheless, he persevered, for he wisely decided that it would be well"
"to reconnoitre, to familiarise himself, as much as possible, with the"
lay of the land and find out whether the trail that he had followed to
"reach the cabin which, he recalled, was perched high up above a ravine,"
was the only means of communication with the valley below. It was a
"useless precaution, for the snow would have wholly obliterated any such"
"trail had there been one and, soon realising the fact, he fell back"
exhausted by his effort on the pillows.
"A half hour passed and the man began to grow restless. He had, of"
"course, no idea whatever of the length of time he had been in the cabin,"
and he knew that he must be thinking of an immediate escape. In
"desperation, he tried to get out of bed, but the task was beyond his"
"breakfast, and were ready for the day’s work. As a matter of fact, they"
"took less time than usual, for something of Bainbridge’s intense"
eagerness for speed seemed to have made itself felt.
All morning Bob worked like a Trojan getting the drive out into the
"Katahdin River. He did not storm and swear at his men, as many bosses"
do. Instead he had a way of jollying them along in a manner which might
"sound superficially like fun, but which held more than an undercurrent"
"of seriousness. He treated them as human beings, not as if they were"
"slaves from whom every last atom of work was to be extracted. And yet,"
"when the need arose, he could hand out a rebuke, the caustic sting of"
which was enough to make a man’s hair stand on end. The result was that
"the crew soon admired him, and when they found how urgent was the need"
"for haste they fell to with a will, and gave the best that was in them."
"Bainbridge was not long in perceiving their attitude, and it gratified"
him intensely. He had never actually had charge of a drive before. He
"knew the theory, of course, but that is very different from the"
practical operation; and the discovery that he could handle a
rough-and-ready crowd like this in a manner so totally different from
that generally practiced by bosses of crews gave him no small
satisfaction.
"By dint of constant labor, at which Bob spared neither himself nor his"
"men, the drive was successfully swung into the slightly larger river by"
two o’clock. There was no real respite even then. The stream was almost
"as difficult as the Megantic, and constant watchfulness was necessary to"
prevent fresh jams at a number of points. Consequently the men snatched
a hurried dinner in relays and hustled back to work again.
"It was about three, and Bob had just left the spot where only the most"
strenuous personal labor on the part of himself and four river jacks had
"and throwing down great loops of rope. Under the trees, growing along"
"the ground, were smaller creepers full of thorns, that tore the wayfarer"
"and barred his progress. The forest, too, was full of snakes that crept"
"along the ground, so like in their gray and yellow skins to the earth"
they travelled on that the traveller trod upon them unawares and was
bitten; and some so beautiful with coral red and golden bars that men
would pick them up as some dainty jewel till the snake turned upon them.
Here and there in this forest were little glades wherein there were
"flowers. Beautiful flowers they were, with deep white cups and broad"
glossy leaves hiding the purple fruit; and some had scarlet blossoms
"that nodded to and fro like drowsy men, and there were long festoons of"
white stars. The air there was heavy with their scent. But they were all
"full of thorns, only you could not see the thorns till after you had"
plucked the blossom.
"This wood was pierced by roads. Many were very broad, leading through"
"the forest in divers ways, some of them stopping now and then in the"
"glades, others avoiding them more or less, but none of them were"
"straight. Always, if you followed them, they bent and bent until after"
"much travelling you were where you began; and the broader the road, the"
"softer the turf beneath it; the sweeter the glades that lined it, the"
quicker did it turn.
"One road there was that went straight, but it was far from the others."
It led among the rocks and cliffs that bounded one side of the valley.
"It was very rough, very far from all the glades in the lowlands. No"
"flowers grew beside it, there was no moss or grass upon it, only hard"
"sharp rocks. It was very narrow, bordered with precipices."
"There were many lights in this wood, lights that flamed out like sunsets"
"and died, lights that came like lightning in the night and were gone."
"for the erudite, who are few; we shall bark to stir up the people. After"
1520 he writes again and again: 'I am stoned every day'.
"But Erasmus, however much he might see himself, not without reason, at"
"the centre, could, in 1519 and 1520, no longer be blind to the fact that"
the great struggle did not concern him alone. On all sides the battle
"was being fought. What is it, that great commotion about matters of"
spirit and of faith?
The answer which Erasmus gave himself was this: it is a great and wilful
conspiracy on the part of the conservatives to suffocate good learning
and make the old ignorance triumph. This idea recurs innumerable times
"in his letters after the middle of 1518. 'I know quite certainly', he"
"writes on 21 March 1519 to one of his German friends, 'that the"
barbarians on all sides have conspired to leave no stone unturned till
they have suppressed _bonae literae_.' 'Here we are still fighting with
the protectors of the old ignorance'; cannot Wolsey persuade the Pope to
stop it here? All that appertains to ancient and cultured literature is
called 'poetry' by those narrow-minded fellows. By that word they
"indicate everything that savours of a more elegant doctrine, that is to"
"say all that they have not learned themselves. All the tumult, the whole"
tragedy--under these terms he usually refers to the great theological
struggle--originates in the hatred of _bonae literae_. 'This is the
source and hot-bed of all this tragedy; incurable hatred of linguistic
"study and the _bonae literae_.' 'Luther provokes those enemies, whom it"
"is impossible to conquer, though their cause is a bad one. And meanwhile"
"envy harasses the _bonae literae_, which are attacked at his (Luther's)"
"instigation by these gadflies. They are already nearly insufferable,"
when things do not go well with them; but who can stand them when they
"triumph? Either I am blind, or they aim at something else than Luther."
They are preparing to conquer the phalanx of the Muses.'
"monthly, which arose fairly directly out of erudite correspondence. It"
"was, as in antiquity--which in this respect was imitated better and more"
"profitably, perhaps, than in any other sphere--an art. Even before 1500"
"Erasmus had, at Paris, described that art in the treatise, _De"
"conscribendis epistolis_, which was to appear in print in 1522. People"
"wrote, as a rule, with a view to later publication, for a wider circle,"
"or at any rate, with the certainty that the recipient would show the"
"letter to others. A fine Latin letter was a gem, which a man envied his"
neighbour. Erasmus writes to Budaeus: 'Tunstall has devoured your letter
to me and re-read it as many as three or four times; I had literally to
tear it from his hands.'
Unfortunately fate did not always take into consideration the author's
"intentions as to publicity, semi-publicity or strict secrecy. Often"
"letters passed through many hands before reaching their destination, as"
did Servatius's letter to Erasmus in 1514. 'Do be careful about
"letters,' he writes more than once; 'waylayers are on the lookout to"
"intercept them.' Yet, with the curious precipitation that characterizes"
"him, Erasmus was often very careless as to what he wrote. From an early"
"age he preserved and cared for his letters, yet nevertheless, through"
"his itinerant life, many were lost. He could not control their"
publication. As early as 1509 a friend sent him a manuscript volume of
"his own (Erasmus's) letters, that he had picked up for sale at Rome."
Erasmus had it burnt at once. Since 1515 he himself superintended the
publication of his letters; at first only a few important ones;
"afterwards in 1516 a selection of letters from friends to him, and after"
"that ever larger collections till, at the end of his life, there"
appeared a new collection almost every year. No article was so much in
"demand on the book market as letters by Erasmus, and no wonder. They"
"were models of excellent style, tasteful Latin, witty expression and"
elegant erudition.
self. I’m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.”
"When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a"
"promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience"
the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.
The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down
"Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables"
"were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good"
"orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible"
"pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His"
"companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air"
that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.
"And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but"
"self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with"
something not far from admiration in her own charming face.
"Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and"
"Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized"
"upon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style,"
and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had
assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an
"idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good"
angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.
"So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and"
riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints
of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly
"impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random"
"insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few"
names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler’s
"short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be"
calls himself in writing to Colet. But again he cannot help giving
"himself credit for acknowledging that quality, nay, converting that"
"quality itself into a virtue: it is modesty, the opposite of boasting"
and self-love.
This bashfulness about himself is the reason that he does not love his
"own physiognomy, and is only persuaded with difficulty by his friends to"
sit for a portrait. His own appearance is not heroic or dignified enough
"for him, and he is not duped by an artist who flatters him: 'Heigh-ho,'"
"he exclaims, on seeing Holbein's thumbnail sketch illustrating the"
"_Moria_: 'if Erasmus still looked like that, he would take a wife at"
once'. It is that deep trait of dissatisfaction that suggests the
inscription on his portraits: 'his writings will show you a better
image'.
Erasmus's modesty and the contempt which he displays of the fame that
fell to his lot are of a somewhat rhetorical character. But in this we
should not so much see a personal trait of Erasmus as a general form
"common to all humanists. On the other hand, this mood cannot be called"
"altogether artificial. His books, which he calls his children, have not"
turned out well. He does not think they will live. He does not set store
by his letters: he publishes them because his friends insist upon it. He
writes his poems to try a new pen. He hopes that geniuses will soon
"appear who will eclipse him, so that Erasmus will pass for a stammerer."
What is fame? A pagan survival. He is fed up with it to repletion and
would do nothing more gladly than cast it off.
Sometimes another note escapes him. If Lee would help him in his
"endeavours, Erasmus would make him immortal, he had told the former in"
"their first conversation. And he threatens an unknown adversary, 'If you"
"go on so impudently to assail my good name, then take care that my"
"gentleness does not give way and I cause you to be ranked, after a"
"""I promise you, Colonel, the maid will be worth her billet,"" said the"
"Sergeant, ""or else she is no true Andaluse. To such an one in old days I"
"have often trusted----"""
Thus far Cardono had proceeded when suddenly he broke off his
"reminiscence, and with a paternal gesture patted Concha's arm as she was"
bending over to transfer a second helping of the _puchero_ to his dish.
"The party was now in excellent marching order, well-provisioned,"
"well-fed, rested, and provided with the best and most recent"
information. Even John Mortimer's slow English blood developed some
"latent Puritanic fire, and he said, ""Hang me if I do not fight for the"
"little girl who was willing to pay for the _whole_ of the goat-milk!"""
"To fight for a Queen, who at the early age of five was prepared to give"
"a wholesale order like that, appeared to John Mortimer a worthy and"
laudable deed of arms. He was free indeed to assist in taking her
"captive, if by so doing he could further the shipping of the Priorato he"
himself had paid for. But to make over to a set of thieves and murderers
a girl who had about her the makings of a good customer and a woman of
"business habits, stirred every chivalric feeling within him."
The night was so dark that it was resolved that the party should leave
their horses behind them in the stables of the deserted farm. They could
then proceed on foot more softly and with more safety to themselves. To
"this La Giralda, knowing that they must return that way, readily"
assented. For the thought of the dead woman she had left in the
"first-floor room haunted her, and even in the darkness of the night she"
could see the stark outlines of the sheet she had spread over the body.
"So it came to pass that once more horseshoe iron clattered, and there"
was a flashing of lights and a noise of voices about the lonely and
men. The light had not been abandoned; it had simply burned itself out.
It was a fortunate circumstance that very little shipping frequents
"these seas during the winter, or there would have been one or two"
"marine disasters, as the islands are often wrapped in fog."
It is surmised that one of the men ventured outside on to a rocky ledge
"in the early hours of the morning. According to the log, a vicious"
"storm was raging at the time, and probably in the darkness the man was"
"swept off his feet and carried into the sea. The second keeper on duty,"
"marvelling at the non-return of his assistant, evidently had roused his"
"other companion, and the two had instituted a search in the storm, only"
in turn to be caught by a wave and carried away.
"In Great Britain, since 1860, men only have been employed by the"
"Trinity House Brethren for the maintenance of the lights, but in"
the United States women still are engaged in this duty. Some of the
British lights have been controlled by one family through two or
three generations. It was only a few years ago that a Darling retired
"from the vigil on the Longstones of Farne Islands, the scene of Grace"
"Darling’s heroism, while for a century and a half one family kept the"
"South Foreland light faithfully. The Casquets light off Alderney, in"
"the Channel Islands, was maintained by one family, some of the children"
"spending the whole of their lives on the rock, son succeeding father at"
the post of duty.
"On the American coast, however, women are more extensively employed."
Seeing that many of the lights are burned in a low tower projecting
"from the dwelling-house, this circumstance may be readily understood,"
as the duties beyond the maintenance of the light are not exacting.
"One of the most notable instances, however, is the Point Pino light"
"at the entrance to Monterey Bay, on the Californian coast, the"
guardianship of which has been in feminine hands for the past thirty
"who, of his own accord, does better things than human laws require? What"
arrogance it is to bind by institutions a man who is clearly led by the
inspirations of the divine spirit!
In Erasmus we already find the beginning of that optimism which judges
"upright man good enough to dispense with fixed forms and rules. As More,"
"in _Utopia_, and Rabelais, Erasmus relies already on the dictates of"
"nature, which produces man as inclined to good and which we may follow,"
provided we are imbued with faith and piety.
In this line of confidence in what is natural and desire of the simple
"and reasonable, Erasmus's educational and social ideas lie. Here he is"
far ahead of his times. It would be an attractive undertaking to discuss
Erasmus's educational ideals more fully. They foreshadow exactly those
"of the eighteenth century. The child should learn in playing, by means"
"of things that are agreeable to its mind, from pictures. Its faults"
should be gently corrected. The flogging and abusive schoolmaster is
Erasmus's abomination; the office itself is holy and venerable to him.
Education should begin from the moment of birth. Probably Erasmus
"attached too much value to classicism, here as elsewhere: his friend"
Peter Gilles should implant the rudiments of the ancient languages in
"his two-year-old son, that he may greet his father with endearing"
stammerings in Greek and Latin. But what gentleness and clear good sense
shines from all Erasmus says about instruction and education!
The same holds good of his views about marriage and woman. In the
problem of sexual relations he distinctly sides with the woman from deep
conviction. There is a great deal of tenderness and delicate feeling in
his conception of the position of the girl and the woman. Few characters
of the _Colloquies_ have been drawn with so much sympathy as the girl
with the lover and the cultured woman in the witty conversation with the
abbot. Erasmus's ideal of marriage is truly social and hygienic. Let us
was regarded by the Germans.
It was in 1837 that Ferrier married the young lady with whom he had so
long corresponded. The marriage was in all respects a happy one. Mrs.
"Ferrier's gifts and graces, inherited from her father, will not soon be"
"forgotten, either in St. Andrews where she lived so long, or in"
"Edinburgh, the later home of her widowhood. One whose spirits were less"
gay might have found a husband whose interests were so completely in
his work--and that a work in which she could not share--difficult to
"deal with; but she possessed understanding to appreciate that work, as"
"well as humour, and could accommodate herself to the circumstances in"
"which she found herself; while he, on his part, entered into the gaiety"
on occasion with the best. A friend and student of the St. Andrews'
"days writes of Ferrier: 'He married his cousin Margaret, Professor's"
"Wilson's daughter, and I don't doubt that a shorthand report of their"
courtship would have been better worth reading than nine hundred and
"ninety-nine out of every thousand courtships, for she had wit as well"
"as beauty, and he was capable of appreciating both. No more charming"
"woman have I ever seen or heard making game of mankind in general, and"
in particular of pedants and hypocrites. She would even laugh at her
"husband on occasion, but it was dangerous for any volunteer to try to"
help her in that sport. A finer-looking couple I have never seen.[5]
"[5] Another sister married William Edmondstoune Aytoun, the"
poet. It was regarding Professor Aytoun's proposal for Miss
Wilson's hand that the following story is told. When the
"engagement was being formed, Aytoun somewhat demurred to"
"interviewing the father of the lady, and she herself"
undertook the mission. Presently she returned with a card
"pinned upon her breast bearing the satisfactory inscription,"
"'With the author's compliments'! Aytoun, as is well known,"
"was extremely plain, and it was of his bust in the"
"""Had to stay in this last trip--been doing some work on the ether,"
"force-field theory, and other advanced stuff that I had to go to Mars"
"and Venus to get. Just got back last week. As for solving mysteries,"
"laugh while you can, old hyena. You and a lot of other dim bulbs think"
that Roeser's Rays are the last word--that there's nothing left to
discover--are going to get jarred loose from your hinges one of these
days. When I came in nine months ago they were hot on the trail of
"something big, and I'll bet they bring it in...."""
Out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo
"blast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in"
every lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:
"""For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field"
"of the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board"
will apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present
"amount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an"
"hour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute."""
"""Hipe!"" barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light sprang into"
"being upon his board, and the assistants came to attention at their"
"stations. ""Seconds! Four! Three! Two! One! LIFT!"" He touched a"
"button and a set of plunger switches drove home, releasing into the"
forty-five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power--the
fifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy that exactly
counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser.
"Simultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set"
"to the exact figure given by the computer, the _plus_-equilibrium"
power--which would not be changed throughout the journey if the ideal
acceleration curve were to be registered upon the recorders--and the
immense mass of the cruiser of the void wafted vertically upward at a
"low and constant velocity. The bellowing, shrieking siren had cleared"
"shell; she would go, she would carry his valuable to this man,"
"our relative-in-law. Next day, he would yomelu; he would catch"
"a pig, he would break off a bunch of betel-nut, he would cut"
"sugar cane, bananas, he would fill the baskets with food, and"
spike the coco-nut on a multi-forked piece of wood. By-and-by
he would bring it. Our house would be filled up. Later on we
"would make a distribution of the bananas, of the sugar cane, of"
"the betel-nut. We give it to our helpers. We sit, we sit (i.e.,"
"we wait); at harvest time he brings yams, he karibudaboda (he"
"gives the payment of that name), the necklace. He would bring"
the food and fill out our yam house.
"This narrative, like many pieces of native information, needs certain"
"corrections of perspective. In the first place, events here succeed one"
another with a rapidity quite foreign to the extremely leisurely way in
which natives usually accomplish such a lengthy process as the making
"of a katudababile. The amount of food which, in the usual manner,"
is enumerated over and over again in this narrative would probably
"not be exaggerated, for--such is native economy--a man who makes a"
necklace to order would get about twice as much or even more for it
"than it would fetch in any other transaction. On the other hand,"
it must be remembered that what is represented here as the final
"payment, the karibudaboda, is nothing else but the normal filling up"
"of the yam house, always done by a man's relations-in-law. None the"
"less, in a year in which a katudababile would be made, the ordinary"
yearly harvest gift would be styled the 'karibudaboda payment for
"the necklace.' The giving of the necklace to the wife, who afterwards"
"carries it to her brother or kinsman, is also characteristic of the"
relation between relatives-in-law.
In Sinaketa and Vakuta only the necklaces made of bigger shell and
"to the trust, but their owners were bound at all times to allow a normal"
"head of water when it was called for. Instead of doing this now, they"
played all sorts of tricks on Bainbridge. When he particularly needed
"plenty of water to float his drive past a shallow or narrow spot, the"
"gates were arbitrarily shut down, and the drive hung up. Again, at one"
point where the middle part of the drive had jammed and the crew were
"occupied in picking it instead of using dynamite, the gates which Bob"
"had personally closed were raised without warning, letting down a flood"
"of water which struck the jam with terrific force. It gave instantly,"
"carrying three men with it. Two managed to escape by a miracle, and were"
dragged ashore with broken limbs; the other was crushed and drowned.
After that Bainbridge placed guards at the various dams with
instructions to shoot any one who attempted to interfere with them. This
"resulted in a terrific outcry on the part of Crane’s underlings, an"
"appeal to the law, injunctions, and all that sort of thing. To which"
"Bainbridge paid no attention whatever. He went on his way calmly,"
"knowing well that they could not stop him in this manner, and willing to"
put up with the inconvenience that would follow when it was all over and
he had returned to civilization.
Mr. Wolcott Sears continued his fishing trip along the route the
"lumbermen were following, and began frequently to appear in camp for an"
"evening pipe with Bainbridge. One evening they had a private conference,"
"which lasted until the small hours, and the Boston capitalist finally"
"departed, leaving Bainbridge apparently much gratified."
The crew was with Bob to a man. By this time they had gathered an
"inkling of the plot against the firm, and of the stakes involved. Men"
had strayed into camp telling of the extraordinary reductions made by
the trust in the price of manufactured lumber. Large sales had resulted
"to various parties, report said, thus preventing Bainbridge & Tweedy, as"
"the article which is sold under the name of sago in our groceries, but"
"is mealy, tough, and almost elastic. The natives consider it a great"
"delicacy, and bake it into little cakes, or boil it into dumplings."
The main fleet of the Dobuans started some time in the second half of
"March from their villages, and went first to the beach of Sarubwoyna,"
"where they held a ceremonial distribution of food, eguya'i, as it is"
"called in Dobu. Then, offering the pokala to Aturamo'a and Atu'a'ine,"
"they sailed by way of Sanaroa and Tewara, passing the tabooed rock"
"of Gurewaya to the Amphletts. The wind was light and changeable,"
weak S.W. breezes prevailing. The progress of this stage of the
journey must have been very slow. The natives must have spent a
"few nights on the intermediate islands and sandbanks, a few canoes'"
crews camping at one spot.
"At that time I had already succeeded in reaching the Amphletts, and"
"had been busy for two or three weeks doing ethnographic work, though"
"not very successfully; for, as I have already once or twice remarked,"
the natives here are very bad informants. I knew of course that the
"Dobuan fleet was soon to come, but as my experience had taught me to"
"mistrust native time-tables and fixtures of date, I did not expect"
"them to be punctual. In this, however, I was mistaken. On a Kula"
"expedition, when the dates are once fixed, the natives make real and"
strenuous efforts to keep to them. In the Amphletts the people were
"busy preparing for the expedition, because they had the intention of"
joining the Dobuans and proceeding with them to the Trobriands. A few
"canoes went to the mainland to fetch sago, pots were being mustered and"
"made ready for stowing away, canoes were overhauled. When the small"
"expedition returned from the mainland with sago, after a week or so,"
"a sagali (in Amphlettan: madare), that is, a ceremonial distribution"
"of food was held on the neighbouring island, Nabwageta."
"fall."""
"He showed no interest whatever in the new plant, refusing even to look"
it over or to express an opinion upon the progress of the work; so they
"sent him out to the ship, where for days he remained in a toad-like"
"lethargy, basking in the sun, sleeping three-fourths of the time and"
spending his waking hours in repeating the awful tale of his
disgraceful peonage.
"To unload the machinery, particularly the heavier pieces, was by no"
"means a simple matter, owing to the furious tides that set in and out"
of the Kalvik River. The first mishap occurred during the trip on which
"the boilers were towed in, and it looked to Boyd less like an accident"
than a carefully planned move to cripple him at one stroke. The other
ships were busily discharging and the roadstead was alive with small
"craft of various kinds, when the huge boilers were swung over the side"
of _The Bedford Castle_ and blocked into position for the journey to
the shore. George and a half-dozen of his men went along with the load
"while Emerson remained on the ship. They were just well under way when,"
"either by the merest chance or by malicious design, several of the"
rival Company's towboats moored to the neighboring ships cast off. The
anchorage was crowded and a boiling six-mile tide made it difficult at
best to avoid collision.
"Hearing a confused shouting to shoreward, Boyd ran to the rail in time"
to see one of the Company tugs at the head of a string of towboats
bearing down ahead of the current directly upon his own slow-moving
lighter. Already it was so close at hand as to make disaster seem
inevitable. He saw Balt wave his arms furiously and heard him bellow
"profane warnings while the fishermen scurried about excitedly, but"
still the tug held to its course. Boyd raised his voice in a wild
"alarm, but had they heard him there was nothing they could have done."
and loved him. And so it was without the slightest feeling of misgiving
that she watched her lover quickly take down his coat and hat from the
"peg on the wall and start for the door. On the other hand, it must have"
required not a little courage on the man's part to have torn himself
"away from this lovely, if unconventional, creature, just as he was"
"beginning to love truly and appreciate her. But, then, Johnson was a man"
of no mean determination!
"Not daring to trust himself to words, Johnson paused to look back over"
his shoulder at the Girl before plunging forth into the night. But on
opening the door all the multitudinous wild noises of the forests
"reached his ears: Sounds of whispering and rocking storm-tossed pines,"
"sounds of the wind making the rounds of the deep canyon below them,"
"sounds that would have made the blood run cold of a man more daring,"
"even, than himself. Like one petrified he stood blinded, almost, by the"
"great drifts of snow that were being driven into the room, while the"
"cabin rocked and shook and the roof cracked and snapped, the lights"
"flickered, smoked, or sent their tongues of fire upward towards the"
"ceiling, the curtains swayed like pendants in the air, and while"
"baskets, boxes, and other small furnishings of the cabin were blown in"
every direction.
But it was the Girl's quick presence of mind that saved them from being
"buried, literally, under the snow. In an instant she had rushed past him"
"and closed both the outer and inner doors of the cabin; then, going over"
"to the window, she tried to look through the heavily frosted panes; but"
"the falling of the sleet and snow, striking the window like fine shot,"
made it impossible for her to see more than a few inches away.
"""Why, it's the first time I knew that it--"" She cut her sentence short"
"and ended with: ""That's the way we git it up here! Look! Look!"""
"short, people of all classes of society, to find their national and"
favorite devotions in it. As a matter of fact no other Anatolian god could
maintain his independence side by side with the deities of Pessinus.[24]
We do not know the internal development of the {61} Phrygian mysteries
sufficiently to give details of the addition of each individual part. But
we can prove that in the course of time certain religions were added to the
one that had been practised in the temple of the Palatine ever since the
republic.
"In the inscriptions of the fourth century, Attis bears the cognomen of"
_menotyrannus_. At that time this name was undoubtedly understood to mean
"""lord of the months,"" because Attis represented the sun who entered a new"
sign of the zodiac every month.[25] But that was not the original meaning
"of the term. ""_Mèn tyrannus_"" appears with quite a different meaning in"
"many inscriptions found in Asia Minor. _Tyrannos_ ([Greek: Turannos]),"
"""lord,"" is a word taken by the Greeks from the Lydian, and the honorable"
"title of ""tyrant"" was given to Mèn, an old barbarian divinity worshiped by"
all Phrygia and surrounding regions.[26] The Anatolian tribes from Caria to
the remotest mountains of Pontus worshiped a lunar god under that name who
"was supposed to rule not only the heavens but also the underworld, because"
the moon was frequently brought into connection with the somber kingdom of
the dead. The growth of plants and the increase of cattle and poultry were
"ascribed to his celestial influence, and the villagers invoked his"
protection for their farms and their district. They also placed their rural
burial grounds under the safeguard of this king of shadows. No god enjoyed
greater popularity in the country districts.
This powerful divinity penetrated into Greece at an early period. Among the
"mixed populations of the Ægean seaports, in the Piræus, at Rhodes, Delos"
"and Thasos, religious associations for his worship were {62} founded. In"
"Attica the presence of the cult can be traced back to the fourth century,"
"discord is signalled by the rattle of dice, thrown by Yudhisthira, the"
"pawn at stake, being the crown. Two hostile arrays are set in motion,"
mighty Kaurava armaments meeting in shock of battle the Pandava host
"with Arjuna as the leader, and Krishna as his Divine Charioteer. At the"
"supreme moment Arjuna had flung down his earthly weapon, Gandiva. It was"
then that the eternal conflict between matter and spirit was decided.
The next panel shows the outward or the material aspect of victory.
Behind a foreground of waving flags is seen the battle field of
Kurukshetra with procession of white-clad mourning women seen by fitful
lights of funeral pyres. In the last panel is seen Yudhisthira
renouncing the fruits of his victory setting out on his last journey. In
"front of him lies the vast and sombre plain and mountain peaks, faintly"
"visible by gleams of unearthly light, unlocalised but playing here and"
there. His wife and his brothers had fallen behind and dropped one by
one. There is to be no human companion in his last journey. The only
thing that stood by him and from which he had never been really
separated is Dharma or the Spirit of Righteousness.
LIFE OF ACTION
Faridpur at that time enjoyed a notoriety of being the stronghold of
"desperate characters, dacoits by land and water. My father had captured"
"single-handed one of the principal leaders, whom he sentenced to a long"
term of imprisonment. After release he came to my father and demanded
"some occupation, since the particular vocation in which he had"
specialised was now rendered impossible. My father took the unusual
"course to employ him as my special attendant to carry me, a child of"
"four, on his back to the distant village school. No nurse could be"
"tenderer than this ex-leader of lawless men, whose profession had been"
to deal out wounds and deaths. He had accepted a life of peace but he
could not altogether wipe out his old memories. He used to fill my
"February 1917, to the students of the Presidency College on receiving"
their _Arghya_ and congratulations on the occasion of his knighthood. It
"was published in the Modern Review for March 1917--Volume XXI, p. 343."
"In your congratulations for the recent honour, you have overlooked a"
"still greater that came to me a year ago, when I was gazetted as your"
"perpetual professor, so that the tie which binds me to you is never to"
be severed. Thirty-two years ago I sought to be your teacher. For the
trust that you imposed on me could I do anything less than place before
you the highest that I knew? I never appealed to your weaknesses but
your strength. I never set before you that was easy but used all the
compulsion for the choice of the most difficult. And perhaps as a
reward for these years of effort I find all over India those who have
been my pupils occupying positions of the highest trust and
responsibility in different walks of life. I do not merely count those
who have won fame and success but I also claim many others who have
taken up the burden of life manfully and whose life of purity and
unselfishness has brought gleams of joy in suffering lives.
THE LAW UNIVERSAL
Through science I was able to teach you how the seeming veils the real;
"how though the garish lights dazzle and blind us, there are lights"
"invisible, which glow persistently after the brief flare burns out. One"
"came to realise how all matter was one, how unified all life was. In the"
various expressions of life even in the realm of thought the same
"Universal law prevails. There was no such thing as brute matter, but"
that spirit suffused matter in which it was enshrined. One also realised
"dimly a mysterious Cyclic Law of Change, seen not merely in inorganic"
matter but also in organised life and its highest manifestations. One
saw how inertness passes into the climax of activity and how that climax
Chief among the objections is the clause which would give the United
States authority to seize the vessels in time of war. It is quite
evident that this power might be employed to the complete destruction of
the Fruit Company’s trade; in fact to its practical extinction as a
business concern. A like power existing in England or Germany would not
"be of equal menace to any single company flying the flag of that nation,"
for there the government’s needs could be fully supplied by a proper
apportionment of requisitions for ships among the many companies. But
with the exceedingly restricted merchant marine of the United States the
danger of the enforcement of this right would be an ever-present menace.
It is for this reason that the Fruit Company steamers fly the British
"flag, and the American in Colon may see, as I did one day, nine great"
ocean ships in the port with only one flying the stars and stripes. The
opening of the canal will not wholly remedy this.

THE END OF THE CROCODILE]
"In all respects save the registry of its ships, however, the Fruit"
Company is a thoroughly American concern and to its operations in the
Caribbean is due much of the good feeling toward the United States which
"is observable there. In 1912 it carried 1,113,741 tons of freight, of"
"which 359,686 was general freight, carried for the public in addition"
"to company freight. This is a notable public service, profitable no"
doubt but vital to the interests of the American tropics. It owns or
"holds under leases 852,650 acres, and in 1912 carried to the United"
"States about 25,000,000 bunches of bananas, and 16,000,000 bunches to"
Great Britain and the Continent. Viewed from the standpoint of the
consumer its work certainly has operated to cheapen bananas and to place
them on sale at points where they were never before seen. The banana has
not participated in the high cost of living nor has one company
commons by various municipalities. Much of this land lies along the line
"of the railroad from Panama to David, and is of varying grades suitable"
"for grazing, forestry or agriculture. A fixed price of 50 cents per"
"hectare is charged, a hectare being practically 2¹⁄₂ acres. The"
government has gone quite efficiently into the task of disposing of
"these lands, and pamphlets explanatory of methods of securing titles,"
"terms, etc., can be obtained by addressing the Administrator-General at"
"Panama. The Pan-American Union, of Washington, D. C., has issued a"
pamphlet giving a summary in English of the Panamanian law bearing upon
the subject.
[Illustration: A NATIVE LIVING ROOM AND STAIRWAY
"By pulling up the bamboo ladder, or turning it, communication with the"
upper floor is closed]
"With the lack of labor, and the uncertainty of land titles, the final"
impediment to the general development of the interior of Panama is to be
found in the lack of roads. It is not that the roads are bad--that is
the case in many of our own commonwealths. But in a great part of Panama
"there are literally no roads at all. Trails, choked by the jungle and so"
"washed by the rains that they are merely lanes floored with boulders,"
are the rule. The heavy ox-cart is the only vehicle that will stand the
"going, and our light American farm wagons would be speedily racked to"
pieces. In the Canal Zone the Commission has built some of the best
"roads in the world, utilizing the labor of employees convicted of minor"
offenses. Stimulated by this example the Panama government has built one
excellent road from the chief city across the savannas to Old Panama and
thence onward into the interior. It is hoped that the spectacle of the
admirable roads in the Zone will encourage the authorities of the
Republic to go into road building on a large scale in their own country.
In no other way can its possibilities be realized. At present the rivers
publicity given to Indian affairs through the reports and hearings of a
"National Commission, would arouse the American people, and a brighter"
day for the Indian would certainly dawn.
"No matter what is said, the Commissioner must fight alone and"
single-handed with the members of Congress. His is a great
"responsibility. Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Valentine, in conversations with"
"me, have admitted that the chief difficulty in handling the Indian"
problem is found in the word “politics”. The Commissioner is dependent
on Congress for his appropriations. He may be sustained or opposed by
"members of Congress, and the public will remain in ignorance. He may not"
appeal save to the Secretary of the Interior. He must keep in mind the
wishes of his political party. He will not admit political pressure when
"in office, but after leaving the Service, he may tell his story of"
"trouble with politicians, as Mr. Leupp has in his book. Mr. Valentine"
"could enlighten us further on “The Indian Office in Politics”, did he"
care to speak. A paid National Commission would be dominated by _no_
political party. Ten years’ service would enable it to become entirely
"familiar with the needs of the Indians, whereas the average"
"Commissioner, serving less than three years, barely becomes acquainted"
with the problem when he is succeeded by a new appointee.
I recommend to the earnest consideration of the American people the
"Commission idea, as the only means of salvation of the American Indian."
It will be said by critics that many of the tribes are making
satisfactory progress and need no Commission; that the present
"organization of the Indian Office is sufficient. This is partly true,"
"but a study of the table of statistics, and reference to the testimony"
"submitted in this book, establishes the sad fact, that the majority of"
the Indians must lose unless we make a radical change in our policy. It
is useless to blind our eyes to hard facts; and these are that we
"develop a certain area after painstaking labor, and then through unwise"
The very question sobered him.
Suddenly it was as though he had left the din of the noisy thoroughfare
of life and had entered the majestic silence of a mighty cathedral;
"and from the great mysterious deeps a whisper came to his ears, each"
"syllable roundly phrased, clear, unhesitating, a chapter of this"
strange book of life that he had so lately read--the book that had
fired his blood and aroused his energy. The breath of these pages
"seemed to give him decision and free air, where before he had been"
"drifting aimlessly, going he knew not whither, caring not overmuch."
This book had braced him--it was a call to battle. He had had enough of
beds of roses and daffodils and idyllic trances. The phrasing of _The
Masterfolk_ came to him now:
“Nature has ordered that certain things shall be; and to him who
disobeys her ordering she is cruelly merciless. She has decreed that
"he shall be most dominant, shall breed the fittest race, shall know"
"the fullest life, shall achieve the highest destiny, who abides"
by the woman he loves. And him who is unclean she flings upon the
"dunghill--him and his seed for ever. Of the love of man for woman,"
Nature has spoken with no uncertain voice; and Nature’s judgment is
final. He that fears to love a woman sets himself against the supreme
law of life; he ends in unnatural vice; he is against the design of
life; celibacy Nature will none of--for celibacy stultifies life and
ends the race. Promiscuous love she condemns utterly and punishes
heavily with loathsome disease and with foul decay; the races of
"promiscuous love are become of the scum of the earth, and are dying"
"out. Against the love of many women also, once and for all, she"
has spoken. The peoples of many wives Nature is sweeping into the
waste corners of the world. Nature is her own jury--Nature alone her
own judge. She hath not said the Masterfolk cannot break from her
"also to undergo the ascendancy of her religion. As a matter of fact, her"
"fervent believers maintained her sanctuaries, despite the law, on the very"
"Capitol. Under Cæsar, Alexandrian astronomers had reformed the calendar of"
"the pontiffs, and Alexandrian priests soon marked the dates of Isis"
holidays upon it.
The decisive step was taken soon after the death of Tiberius. Caligula
erected the great temple of Isis Campensis on the Campus Martius probably
"in the year 38.[29] In order to spare the sacerdotal susceptibilities, he"
founded it outside of the sacred enclosure of the city of Servius. Later
Domitian made one of Rome's most splendid monuments of that temple. From
"that time Isis and Serapis enjoyed the favor of every imperial dynasty, the"
Flavians as well as the Antonines and the Severi. About the year 215
"Caracalla built an Isis temple, even more magnificent than that of"
"Domitian, on the Quirinal, in the heart of the city, and perhaps another"
"one on the Coelian. As the apologist Minucius Felix states, the Egyptian"
gods had become entirely Roman.[30]
The climax of their power seems to have been reached at the beginning of
the third century; later on the popular vogue and official support went to
"other divinities, like the Syrian Baals and the Persian {85} Mithras. The"
"progress of Christianity also deprived them of their power, which was,"
"however, still considerable until the end of the ancient world. The Isis"
processions that marched the streets of Rome were described by an eye
"witness as late as the year 394,[31] but in 391 the patriarch Theophilus"
"had consigned the Serapeum of Alexandria to the flames, having himself"
struck the first blow with an ax against the colossal statue of the god
that had so long been the object of a superstitious veneration. Thus the
"prelate destroyed the ""very head of idolatry,"" as Rufinus put it.[32]"
"As a matter of fact, idolatry received its death blow. The worship of the"
gods of the Ptolemies died out completely between the reigns of Theodosius
"the rapid diminution in the supply of real ivory, should be a growing"
one.
"Indeed, the more one studies Panama and its resources the more one is"
convinced that all that is necessary to make the country a rich and
"prosperous one, or at any rate to cause it to create riches and"
"prosperity for investors, is the application of capital, labor and"
systematic management to the resources it already possesses. In its 400
years of Spanish and mestizo control these three factors have been
"continuously lacking. There are men in Panama, of native birth and of"
"Spanish origin, who have undertaken to develop certain of the land’s"
resources and have moderately enriched themselves. But the most striking
evidence of the success to be obtained from attacking the industrial
problem in Panama systematically and in a big way is that furnished by
"the operations of the United Fruit Company, the biggest business fact in"
the tropics.
"Panama is, of course, only one link in the colossal chain of the"
operations of this company in the tropics. The rapidly increasing
prosperity of many of the Central Republics is due largely to the
"sweeping scope of the United Fruit Company, and its impress is in"
evidence all along the north coast of South America and throughout the
West Indies. Its interests in Jamaica are enormous. Cuba put Jamaica off
"the sugar map, but the United Fruit Company came to her rescue with an"
"offer to purchase all the bananas her planters could furnish, and"
"Jamaica now leads the American tropics with 17,000,000 bunches annually,"
"of which the United Fruit Company obtains nearly half, the balance being"
handled by its competitors. The company also owns the famous Titchfield
"Hotel of Port Antonio, and operates the Myrtle Bank Hotel of Kingston."
"In Cuba the company owns 60,000 acres of sugar plantations and its two"
great sugar mills will this year add to the world’s product an amount
"with a market value in excess of $10,000,000. Its scores of white"
faith. It was a world that had never existed as such. For with the
historical reality which the times of Constantine and the great fathers
of the Church had manifested--that of declining Latinity and
"deteriorating Hellenism, the oncoming barbarism and the oncoming"
Byzantinism--it had nothing in common. Erasmus's imagined world was an
"amalgamation of pure classicism (this meant for him, Cicero, Horace,"
Plutarch; for to the flourishing period of the Greek mind he remained
"after all a stranger) and pure, biblical Christianity. Could it be a"
"union? Not really. In Erasmus's mind the light falls, just as we saw in"
"the history of his career, alternately on the pagan antique and on the"
Christian. But the warp of his mind is Christian; his classicism only
"serves him as a form, and from Antiquity he only chooses those elements"
which in ethical tendency are in conformity with his Christian ideal.
[Illustration: XVI. ERASMUS AT THE AGE OF 57]
"And because of this, Erasmus, although he appeared after a century of"
"earlier Humanism, is yet new to his time. The union of Antiquity and the"
"Christian spirit which had haunted the mind of Petrarch, the father of"
"Humanism, which was lost sight of by his disciples, enchanted as they"
"were by the irresistible brilliance of the antique beauty of form, this"
union was brought about by Erasmus.
What pure Latinity and the classic spirit meant to Erasmus we cannot
"feel as he did because its realization does not mean to us, as to him, a"
difficult conquest and a glorious triumph. To feel it thus one must have
"acquired, in a hard school, the hatred of barbarism, which already"
during his first years of authorship had suggested the composition of
the _Antibarbari_. The abusive term for all that is old and rude is
"already Gothic, Goths. The term barbarism as used by Erasmus comprised"
much of what we value most in the medieval spirit. Erasmus's conception
of the great intellectual crisis of his day was distinctly dualistic. He
"The true occupation for a mind like his was paraphrasing, in which,"
"indeed, he amply indulged. Soothing down and unfolding was just the work"
he liked. It is characteristic that he paraphrased the whole New
Testament except the Apocalypse.
Erasmus's mind was neither philosophic nor historic. His was neither the
"work of exact, logical discrimination, nor of grasping the deep sense of"
the way of the world in broad historical visions in which the
"particulars themselves, in their multiplicity and variegation, form the"
image. His mind is philological in the fullest sense of the word. But by
that alone he would not have conquered and captivated the world. His
mind was at the same time of a deeply ethical and rather strong
aesthetic trend and those three together have made him great.
"The foundation of Erasmus's mind is his fervent desire of freedom,"
"clearness, purity, simplicity and rest. It is an old ideal of life to"
"which he gave new substance by the wealth of his mind. Without liberty,"
life is no life; and there is no liberty without repose. The fact that
he never took sides definitely resulted from an urgent need of perfect
"independence. Each engagement, even a temporary one, was felt as a"
"fetter by Erasmus. An interlocutor in the _Colloquies_, in which he so"
"often, spontaneously, reveals his own ideals of life, declares himself"
"determined neither to marry, nor to take holy orders, nor to enter a"
"monastery, nor into any connection from which he will afterwards be"
unable to free himself--at least not before he knows himself completely.
"'When will that be? Never, perhaps.' 'On no other account do I"
congratulate myself more than on the fact that I have never attached
"myself to any party,' Erasmus says towards the end of his life."
Liberty should be spiritual liberty in the first place. 'But he that is
"spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man,' is"
the word of Saint Paul. To what purpose should he require prescriptions
mainly upon his fists. Blows were rained upon him from unguarded
"quarters, he was kicked, battered, and flung about, his blind instinct"
finally leading him to clinch with whomsoever his hands encountered.
"Then a sudden blackness swallowed him up, after which he found himself"
"upon his knees, his arms loosely encircling a pair of legs, and"
realized that he had been half-stunned by a blow from behind. The legs
"he was clutching tried to kick him loose, at which he summoned all his"
"strength, knowing that he must go down no further; but as he struggled"
"upward, something smote him in the side with sickening force, and he"
went to his knees again.
"Close beside him he saw the club he had dropped, and endeavored to"
"reach it; but before he could do so, a hand snatched it away and he"
"heard a voice cursing above him. A second time he tried to rise, but"
his shocked nerves failed to transmit the impulse to his muscles; he
could only raise his shoulder and fling an arm weakly above his head in
anticipation of the crushing blow he knew was coming. But it did not
"descend, Instead, he heard a gun shot--that sound for which his ears"
had been strained from the first--and then for an instant he wondered
"if it had been directed at himself. A weight sank across his calves,"
"the legs he had been holding broke away from his grasp; then, with a"
"final effort, he pulled himself free and staggered to his feet, his"
"head rocking, his knees sagging. He saw a man's figure facing him, and"
"lunged at it, to bring up in the arms of ""Fingerless"" Fraser, who cried"
sharply:
"""Are you hurt, Bo?"""
"Too dazed to answer, he turned and beheld the body of a man stretched"
"face downward on the floor. Beyond, the fellow in the gray suit was"
disappearing into the crowd. Even yet Boyd did not realize whence the
"shot had come, although the smell of powder was sharp in his nostrils."
Osiris were either immediately identified or else were identical from the
beginning. The divinity whose worship was started at Alexandria by Ptolemy
was the god that ruled the dead and shared his immortality with them. He
"was fundamentally an Egyptian god, and the most popular of the deities of"
the Nile. Herodotus says that Isis and Osiris were revered by every
"inhabitant of the country, and their traditional holidays involved secret"
ceremonies whose sacred meaning the Greek writer dared not reveal.[2]
"Recognizing their Osiris in Serapis, the Egyptians readily accepted the new"
cult. There was a tradition that a new dynasty should introduce a new god
or give a sort of preeminence to the god of its own district. From time
immemorial politics had changed the {75} government of heaven when changing
that of earth. Under the Ptolemies the Serapis of Alexandria naturally
"became one of the principal divinities of the country, just as the Ammon of"
Thebes had been the chief of the celestial hierarchy under the Pharaohs of
"that city, or as, under the sovereigns from Sais, the local Neith had the"
primacy. At the time of the Antonines there were forty-two Serapeums in
Egypt.[3]
But the purpose of the Ptolemies was not to add one more Egyptian god to
the countless number already worshiped by their subjects. They wanted this
"god to unite in one common worship the two races inhabiting the kingdom,"
and thus to further a complete fusion. The Greeks were obliged to worship
him side by side with the natives. It was a clever political idea to
institute a Hellenized Egyptian religion at Alexandria. A tradition
"mentioned by Plutarch[4] has it that Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, a"
"man of advanced ideas, together with Timotheus, a Eumolpid from Eleusis,"
thought out the character that would best suit the newcomer. The result was
that the composite religion founded by the Lagides became a combination of
the old creed of the Pharaohs and the Greek mysteries.
"First of all, the liturgic language was no longer the native idiom but"
"fell with terrific force upon the dome of the lantern, splintering the"
"roof and smashing the light, so that no welcome rays could be thrown"
from the tower again that night. The keepers at once set to work with
"the fog-signal, and during the hours of darkness worked like slaves,"
blaring out a warning by sound which they were unable to give visually.
"Fortunately, such an experience as befell the keepers of the American"
Thimble Shoal light is very rare. This beacon marks the shoal of that
"name, and is, or rather was, a screw-pile iron lighthouse, marking 11"
"feet of water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. On"
"December 27, 1909, the keepers were immersed in their tasks, when there"
was a terrible crash followed by a dismal rending and splitting. The
building shivered from top to bottom. The keepers were thrown off their
"feet, and when they regained their wits they found that the schooner"
"_Malcolm Baxter Junior_, while being towed by a tug, had blundered into"
"them, and had carried a considerable portion of the building away. The"
"impact upset the light; the scattered oil burst into flame, and within"
a few minutes the lighthouse was blazing like a gigantic bonfire. The
"keepers stuck to their posts, and endeavoured frantically to extinguish"
"the outbreak, but their efforts were too puny to make any impression."
"At last, when a foothold was no longer possible with safety, and under"
"extreme pressure, they abandoned their charge. When the flames had"
completed their destructive work the lighthouse presented a sorry
"sight, being a mass of broken and twisted ironwork. A wooden tower was"
"erected with all despatch, and a fog-signal was installed, so that the"
men could carry on their duties while the reconstruction of the station
was hurried forward.
"The keepers turn their hands to strange occupations. Fretwork,"
"wood-carving, poker-work, and similar hobbies, are practised freely."
A few devote their leisure to intellectual improvement to fit them
"for other walks in life. The keeper of Windward Point, Guantanamo"
of the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for
some guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this
"petition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on"
furlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He
"journeys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is"
concerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops
"(November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are"
nearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and
"there he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident"
islanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the
house of a personal opponent.
Other events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to
"France. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican"
patriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return
and enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of
"liberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the"
consequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many
"Corsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of"
Napoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of
the French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The
conduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of
ingratitude towards France. The decree of the French National
"Assembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by"
acts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly
"dispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and"
"recognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,"
"amidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and"
"behaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be"
"assured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred"
long nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not
"to be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was"
NO thanksgiving?--Awake! Awake! the Voice you have yourselves set in
your high Cathedral towers reproaches your lack of love with its iron
"tongue, and summons you all to worship Him the Ever-Glorious, through"
whose mercy alone you live!
"To and fro,--to and fro,--gravely persistent, sublimely eloquent, the"
"huge, sustained, and heavy monotone went thudding through the"
"stillness,--till, startled from his profound sleep by such loud, lofty,"
"and incessant clangor, Alwyn turned on his pillow and listened,"
"half-aroused, half-bewildered,--then, remembering where he was, he"
understood; it was the great Bell of the Dom pealing forth its first
"summons to the earliest Mass. He lay quiet for a little while, dreamily"
counting the number of reverberations each separate stroke sent
"quivering on the air,--but presently, finding it impossible to sleep"
"again, he got up, and drawing aside the curtain looked out of the"
"window of his room, which fronted on the Platz. Though it was not yet"
"six o'clock, the city was all astir,--the Rhinelanders are an early"
"working people, and to see the sun rise is not with them a mere fiction"
"of poesy, but a daily fact. It was one of the loveliest of lovely"
"spring mornings--the sky was clear as a pale, polished sapphire, and"
every little bib of delicate carving and sculpture on the Dom stood out
from its groundwork with microscopically beautiful distinctness. And as
"his gaze rested on the perfect fairness of the day, a strange and"
"sudden sense of rapturous anticipation possessed his mind,--he felt as"
"one prepared for some high and exquisite happiness,--some great and"
"wondrous celebration or feast of joy! The thoughts of death, on which"
"he had brooded so persistently during the past yester-eve, had fled,"
"leaving no trace behind,--only a keen and vigorous delight in life"
"absorbed him now. It was good to be alive, even on this present earth!"
"it was good to see, to feel, to know! and there was much to be thankful"
for in the mere capability of easy and healthful breathing!

"attended by an ever-increasing throng of unwashed Venetians, whose"
interest could not have been keener had Santos Dumont's air-ship or a
"Japanese jinriksha suddenly appeared in their gondola-ridden town, and"
who commented in shrill Italian on this wheeled apparition. The lady is
"not easily beaten when she decides to do anything, but, after standing"
"that for half a block or so, she made a hasty retreat to the hotel, and"
"wheels disappeared, probably forever, from the streets of Venice."
[Sidenote: Gondolas and Gondoliers.]
"Although Venice, with its population of one hundred and sixty-three"
"thousand, is seven miles in circumference, and is divided by one"
"hundred and forty-six canals into one hundred and seventeen islands,"
yet these are so joined together by means of four hundred bridges that
it is possible to walk all over the city. But the bridges are built in
"steps, and cannot be used by wheeled vehicles. There are no horses or"
"carriages of any kind. The funereal-looking gondola, always painted"
"black, is the only conveyance upon these streets of water, and does"
"duty for cab, omnibus, wagon, cart, wheelbarrow and hearse. It is used"
"for pleasure riding, shopping, church-going, theatre-going, visiting,"
"carrying prisoners to jail, carrying the dead to the cemetery--in"
"short, for everything."
"In propelling this black but graceful and easy-going boat, the"
"gondolier does not sit. He stands, on a sort of deck platform towards"
"the stern, and to balance his weight there is affixed to the prow a"
"heavy piece of shining steel, which rears itself at the front almost"
"like a figure-head, only this is always of the same pattern, simply"
"a broad, upright blade of steel, notched deeply on the front edge."
"The gondolier does not pull the oar, he pushes it--there is only one"
"oar--and he does not change it from side to side, as in paddling a"
"once that nothing was to be expected of Eugenio, whose ancient and"
tottering limbs could hardly support the weight of his body. But there
was more hope of the two others. They proved to be stout young fellows
"from the neighbourhood, and professed the utmost eagerness for a bout"
with the gipsies. From their youth they had been accustomed to the use
of firearms--it is to be feared without due licence--in the royal
hunting preserves of Peñalara and the Guadarrama.
"But this made no difference to Rollo, who instantly set about equipping"
"them with the necessary arms, and inquiring minutely about the"
fastenings of the lower doors and windows. These it appeared were
"strong. The doors themselves were covered without with sheet-iron, while"
all the windows were protected not only by shutters but by solid
stanchions of iron sunk in the wall.
"On the whole Rollo was satisfied, and next questioned the servants"
concerning the state of the town and whether any assistance was to be
"hoped for from that quarter. In this, however, he was disappointed. It"
appeared that the whole municipality of San Ildefonso was so utterly
"plague-stricken that scarce an able-bodied man remained, or so much as a"
halfling boy capable of shouldering a musket. Only the women stood still
"in the breach, true nursing mothers, not like her of Ramah, refusing to"
"be comforted, but continuing rather to tend the sick and dying till they"
"themselves also died--aye, even shrouding the dead and laying out the"
corpses. A faithful brother or two of the Hermitage abode to carry the
last Sacraments of the Church through the deserted and grass-grown
"streets, though there were few or none now to fall on their knees at the"
"passage of _Su Majestad_, or to uncover the head at the melancholy"
tolling of the funeral bell.
With characteristic swiftness of decision Rollo made up his mind that
the best plan for the defence of the palace would be to place his scanty
"publishers, although Morgan was, if possible, more indignant over the"
"statement in the same book that he had been kidnapped in Wales and sold,"
"as a boy, and sent to be a slave in Barbadoes. That he could descend to"
"rank dishonesty was shown when, returning from his extraordinary and"
"successful assault on the city of Panama in 1670, to Chagres, he left most"
"of his faithful followers behind, without ships or food, while he slipped"
"off in the night with most of the booty to Jamaica. No doubt, young Morgan"
"came to Jamaica with good credentials from his uncle, the Colonel, for the"
"latter was held in high esteem by Modyford, then Governor of Barbadoes,"
"who describes Colonel Morgan as ""that honest privateer."""
Colonel Morgan did not live to see his nephew reach the pinnacle of his
"success, for in the year 1665 he was sent at the head of an expedition to"
"attack the Dutch stronghold at St. Eustatius Island, but he was too old to"
stand the hardships of such an expedition and died shortly afterwards.
By this time Morgan had made his name as a successful and resolute
buccaneer by returning to Port Royal from a raiding expedition in Central
America with a huge booty.
"In 1665 Morgan, with two other buccaneers, Jackman and Morris, plundered"
"the province of Campeachy, and then, acting as Vice-Admiral to the most"
"famous buccaneer of the day, Captain Mansfield, plundered Cuba, captured"
"Providence Island, sacked Granada, burnt and plundered the coast of Costa"
"Rica, bringing back another booty of almost fabulous wealth to Jamaica. In"
"this year Morgan married a daughter of his uncle, Colonel Morgan."
"In 1668, when 33 years of age, Morgan was commissioned by the Jamaican"
"Government to collect together the privateers, and by 1669 he was in"
"command of a big fleet, when he was almost killed by a great explosion in"
"the _Oxford_, which happened while Morgan was giving a banquet to his"
"captains. About this time Morgan calmly took a fine ship, the _Cour"
"At one point, indeed, they passed near enough to distinguish in the far"
"north the snow-flecked buttresses of the Sierra de Moncayo. But these,"
"they knew, were the haunts of their Carlist allies. The towns and"
"villages of the plain, however, were invariably held by Nationals, and"
"it had often gone hard with them, had not Sergeant Cardono detached"
"himself from the cavalcade, and, venturing alone into the midst of the"
"enemy, by methods of his own produced the materials for many an"
"excellent meal. At last, one day the Sergeant came back to the party"
"with an added gloom on his long, lean, leathern-textured face. He had"
"brought with him an Estramaduran ham, a loaf of wheaten bread, and a"
double string of sausages. But upon his descending into the temporary
"camp which sheltered the party in the bottom of a _barranco_, or deep"
crack in the parched plateau overgrown with scented thyme and dwarf
"oak, it became obvious that he had news of the most serious import to"
communicate.
"He called Rollo aside, and told him how he had made his way into a"
"village, as was his custom, and found all quiet--the shops open, but"
"none to attend to them, the customs superintendent in his den by the"
"gate, seated on his easy chair, but dead--the presbytery empty of the"
"priest, the river bank dotted with its array of worn scrubbing boards,"
"but not a washerwoman to be seen. Only a lame lad, furtively plundering,"
had leaped backward upon his crutch with a swift drawing of his knife
and a wolfish gleam of teeth. He had first of all warned the Sergeant to
"keep off at his peril, but had afterwards changed his tone and confessed"
"to him that the plague was abroad in the valley of the Duero, and that"
he was the only being left alive in the village save the vulture and the
prowling dog.
"""The plague!"" Sergeant Cardono had gasped, like every Spaniard stricken"
sick at the very sound of the word.
and the habit of meditation without allowing the mind to dissipate
"itself. Inspired by his visits to the ancient Universities, at Taxila,"
"at Nalanda and at Conjevaram, Dr. Bose had the strongest confidence that"
India would soon see a revival of those glorious traditions. There will
soon rise a Temple of Learning where the teacher cut off from worldly
"distractions would go on with his ceaseless pursuit after truth, and"
"dying, hand on his work to his disciples. Nothing would seem laborious"
"in his inquiry; never is he to lose sight of his quest, never is he to"
let it go obscured by any terrestrial temptation. For he is the Sanyasin
"spirit, and India is the only country where so far from there being a"
conflict between science and religion. Knowledge is regarded as religion
itself. Such a misuse of science as is now unfortunately in evidence in
the West would be impossible here. Had the conquest of air been achieved
"in India, her very first impulse would be to offer worship at every"
temple for such a manifestation of the divinity in man.
ECONOMIC DANGER OF INDIA
One of the most interesting events in his tour round the world was his
"stay in Japan, where he had ample opportunity of becoming acquainted"
with the efforts of the people and their aspirations towards a great
future. No one can help being filled with admiration for what they have
"achieved. In materialistic efficiency, which in a mechanical era is"
"regarded as an index of civilisation, they have even surpassed their"
German teachers. A few decades ago they had no foreign shipping and no
manufacture. But within an incredibly short time their magnificent lines
of steamers have proved so formidable a competitor that the great
American line in the Pacific will soon be compelled to stop their
"sailings. Their industries again, through the wise help of the State and"
other adventitious aids are capturing foreign markets. But far more
admirable is their foresight to save their country from any embroilment
"ii, 2-4; Hume's ed. i, 328 _sq._). In fine, the conventional Spain"
"is a manufactured system, developed under a Teutonic dynasty. ""To a"
German race of sovereigns Spain finally owed the subversion of her
"national system and ancient freedom"" (Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ 4th"
"ed. i, 5)."
"No doubt the Dutch disaffection to Philip, which began to reveal itself"
"immediately after his accession, may be conceived as having economic"
"grounds. Indeed, his creation of fresh bishoprics, and his manipulation"
"of the abbey revenues, created instant and general resentment among"
"churchmen and nobles,[766] as compared with his mere continuation of"
"religious persecution; and despite his pledges to the contrary, certain"
posts in the Low Countries were conferred on Spaniards.[767] But had he
"shown his father's adaptability, all this could have been adjusted. Had"
he either lived at Brussels or made the Flemings feel that he held them
"an integral part of his empire, he would have had the zealous support of"
"the upper classes in suppressing the popular heresy, which repelled"
"them. Heresy in the Netherlands, indeed, seems thus far to have been on"
"the whole rather licentious and anarchic than austere or ""spiritual."""
"The pre-Protestant movements of the Béguines, Beghards, and Lollards,"
"beginning well, had turned out worse than the orders of friars in the"
"south; and the decorous ""Brethren of the Common Lot"" were in the main"
"""good churchmen,"" only a minority accepting Protestantism.[768] In face"
of the established formulas concerning the innate spirituality of the
"Teuton, and of the play of his ""conscience"" in his course at the"
"Reformation, there stand the historic facts that in the Teutonic world"
"alone was the Reformation accompanied by widespread antinomianism,"
"debauchery, and destructive violence. In France, Spain, and Italy there"
"were no such movements as the Anabaptist, which so far as it could go"
was almost a dissolution of sane society.[769] From Holland that
"movement drew much of its strength and leadership, even as, in a"
"previous age, the antinomian movement of Tanquelin had there had its"
"1783-4. According to his schoolfellow, Bourrienne, these mimic"
"fortifications were planned by Buonaparte, who also directed the"
"methods of attack and defence: or, as others say, he reconstructed"
"the walls according to the needs of modern war. In either case, the"
incident bespeaks for him great power of organization and control. But
there were in general few outlets for his originality and vigour. He
"seems to have disliked all his comrades, except Bourrienne, as much as"
they detested him for his moody humours and fierce outbreaks of
temper. He is even reported to have vowed that he would do as much
harm as possible to the French people; but the remark smacks of the
story-book. Equally doubtful are the two letters in which he prays to
be removed from the indignities to which he was subjected at
"Brienne[7]. In other letters which are undoubtedly genuine, he refers"
"to his future career with ardour, and writes not a word as to the"
bullying to which his Corsican zeal subjected him. Particularly
noteworthy is the letter to his uncle begging him to intervene so as
"to prevent Joseph Buonaparte from taking up a military career. Joseph,"
"writes the younger brother, would make a good garrison officer, as he"
"was well formed and clever at frivolous compliments--""good therefore"
"for society, but for a fight--?"""
Napoleon's determination had been noticed by his teachers. They had
"failed to bend his will, at least on important points. In lesser"
details his Italian adroitness seems to have been of service; for the
"officer who inspected the school reported of him: ""Constitution,"
"health excellent: character submissive, sweet, honest, grateful:"
conduct very regular: has always distinguished himself by his
application to mathematics: knows history and geography passably: very
weak in accomplishments. He will be an excellent seaman: is worthy to
"enter the School at Paris."" To the military school at Paris he was"
"accordingly sent in due course, entering there in October, 1784. The"
change from the semi-monastic life at Brienne to the splendid edifice
"his service in apprehending one of the assassins of Francesco Cenci,"
"on the ground that thus ""the other accomplices and their confessions"
"were secured, and _so many thousands of crowns brought into the"
"papal treasury_."" The venality of Pope Alexander VI., Rodrigo Borgia"
"(1492-1503), ""the wicked and avaricious father of Cæsar and Lucretia,"
who is believed to have died of the poison which he intended for one
"of his cardinals,"" is thus hit off by Pasquino:"
"""Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;"
"Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest."""
"Of Innocent X. (1644-'55), Pasquino says, ""Magis amat Olympiam quam"
"Olympium,"" referring to the shameful relations existing between this"
"Pope and his avaricious sister-in-law, Olympia Maidalchini, who made"
it her business to secure the profits of the papacy in hard cash.
"Trollope, in his _Life of Olympia_, says: ""No appointment to office of"
any kind was made except in consideration of a proportionable sum paid
down into her own coffers. This often amounted to three or four years'
revenue of the place to be granted. Bishoprics and benefices were sold
as fast as they became vacant. One story is told of an unlucky disciple
"of Simon, who in treating with the Pope for a valuable see, just fallen"
"vacant, and hearing from her a price at which it might be his, far"
"exceeding all he could command, persuaded the members of his family to"
sell all they had for the purpose of making this profitable investment.
"The price was paid, and the bishopric was given him, but, with a"
"fearful resemblance to the case of Ananias, he died within the year,"
and his ruined family saw the see a second time sold by the insatiable
"and incorrigible Olympia.... During the last year of Innocent's life,"
"Olympia literally hardly ever quitted him. Once a week, we read, she"
"left the Vatican, secretly by night, accompanied by several porters"
"carrying sacks of coins, the proceeds of the week's extortions and"
"sales, to her own palace. And during these short absences she used to"
"a pariah, except among the poor of Brussels in the Quartier des"
"Marolles. Here she was only regarded as a kind Englishwoman,"
"unwearied in her efforts to alleviate suffering, mental and bodily."
"And meantime, silence, a wall of silence as regarded"
England--England which she was beginning to look upon as the
paradise from which she had been chased. Not a word had come through
"from Rossiter, from Honoria, Bertie Adams, or any of her Suffrage"
friends. I can supply briefly what she did not know.
Rossiter at the very outbreak of War had offered his services as one
deeply versed in anatomy and in physiology to the Army Medical
"Service, and especially to a great person at the War Office; but had"
been told quite cavalierly that they had no need of him. As he
"persisted, he had been asked--in the hope that it might get rid of"
him--to go over to the United States in company with a writer of
"comic stories, a retired actor and a music-hall singer, and lecture"
on the causes of the War in the hope of bringing America in. This he
"had declined to do, and being rich and happening to know personally"
General Armstrong (Honoria's husband) he had been allowed to
accompany him to the vicinity of the front and there put his
theories of grafting flesh and bone to the test; with the ultimate
results that his work became of enormous beneficial importance and
"he was given rank in the R.A.M.C. Honoria, racked with anxiety about"
"her dear ""Army,"" and very sad as to Vivie's disappearance, slaved at"
War work as much as her children's demands on her permitted; or even
put her children on one side to help the sick and wounded. Vivie's
Suffrage friends forgot she had ever existed and turned their
"attention to propaganda, to recruiting for the Voluntary Army which"
"our ministers still hoped might suffice to win the War, to the"
"making of munitions, or aeroplane parts, to land work and to any"
when convicted of error.
Erasmus perhaps never quite realized how much his philological-critical
method must shake the foundations of the Church. He was surprised at his
adversaries 'who could not but believe that all their authority would
"perish at once when the sacred books might be read in a purified form,"
and when people tried to understand them in the original'. He did not
feel what the unassailable authority of a sacred book meant. He rejoices
"because Holy Scripture is approached so much more closely, because all"
sorts of shadings are brought to light by considering not only what is
"said but also by whom, for whom, at what time, on what occasion, what"
"precedes and what follows, in short, by the method of historical"
philological criticism. To him it seemed so especially pious when
reading Scripture and coming across a place which seemed contrary to the
"doctrine of Christ or the divinity of his nature, to believe rather that"
one did not understand the phrase _or that the text might be corrupt_.
Unperceived he passed from emendation of the different versions to the
correction of the contents. The epistles were not all written by the
apostles to whom they are attributed. The apostles themselves made
"mistakes, at times."
The foundation of his spiritual life was no longer a unity to Erasmus.
"It was, on the one hand, a strong desire for an upright, simple, pure"
"and homely belief, the earnest wish to be a good Christian. But it was"
"also the irresistible intellectual and aesthetic need of the good taste,"
"the harmony, the clear and exact expression of the Ancients, the dislike"
of what was cumbrous and involved. Erasmus thought that good learning
might render good service for the necessary purification of the faith
and its forms. The measure of church hymns should be corrected. That
"Christian expression and classicism were incompatible, he never"
believed. The man who in the sphere of sacred studies asked every author
for his credentials remained unconscious of the fact that he
thus given and received is equivalent to that given by the Pope in
"person in St. Peter's. Truly a novel way of turning an honest penny!"""
"We hear that a rash churchman, not liking the facts just stated,"
"undertook to deny them in the public prints, when up spoke some English"
"gentlemen, who had been in Rome recently, and bowled the churchman over"
with the statement that they had themselves seen this blessing machine
on the Corso.
One never touches this subject of the vast wealth of the papacy without
"calling to mind the well-known rejoinder of the great theologian,"
"Thomas Aquinas, when the Pope was showing him all his money and riches,"
"and said, ""You see, Thomas, the church cannot now say what it said in"
"early times, 'Silver and gold have I none.'"" ""No,"" answered Aquinas,"
"""nor can it say, 'Rise up and walk'"" (Acts iii. 6). This loss of"
"spiritual power, this loss of ability to minister salvation to others,"
is one of the most melancholy results of the corruption of the papacy.
[Sidenote: Some Ugly Things in the Lives of the Popes.]
"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his recent book on _The Roman Catholic"
"Church in Italy_, which has received the hearty approval of the King"
"of Italy and his Prime Minister, says: ""There are few, I daresay,"
"who have looked into the history of the popes, no matter what their"
"religious faith may be, who will not agree with me when I say that it"
does not afford pleasant reading. One's intellect rebels against their
"preposterous claims and pretensions, and one's moral sense against"
"their character and lives. Amongst them there were some good men, some"
"learned men, and some really able men; but, taking them all in all,"
"they were, beyond doubt, amongst the lowest class of men to be found"
on the pages of history. To wade through their lives is to cross a
"pestiferous moral swamp of worldliness, simony, nepotism, concubinage,"
"personal animosities, sanguinary feuds, forged decretals, plunderings,"
"with the country round Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment"
"as to the tendency of papal domination. The descent of Spain, once"
"the first among the monarchies, to the lowest depths of degradation,"
"the elevation of Holland, in spite of many natural disadvantages, to"
"a position such as no commonwealth so small has ever reached, teach"
the same lesson. Whoever passes in Germany from a Roman Catholic to
"a Protestant principality, in Switzerland from a Roman Catholic to a"
"Protestant canton, in Ireland from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant"
"county, finds that he has passed from a lower to a higher grade of"
civilization. On the other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails.
The Protestants of the United States have left far behind them the
"Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Roman Catholics of"
"Lower Canada remain inert, while the whole continent round them is"
in a ferment with Protestant activity and enterprise. The French
"have doubtless shown an energy and intelligence which, even when"
"misdirected, have justly entitled them to be called a great people."
"But this apparent exception, when examined, will be found to confirm"
"the rule, for in no country that is called Roman Catholic has the"
"Roman Catholic Church, during several generations, possessed so little"
"authority as in France."""
"Charles Dickens, in a letter written from Switzerland, in 1845, to"
"his friend and biographer, Forster, says: ""In the Simplon, hard"
"by here, where (at the bridge of St. Maurice over the Rhone) the"
"Protestant canton ends and a Catholic canton begins, you might"
separate two perfectly distinct and different conditions of humanity
by drawing a line with your stick in the dust on the ground. On the
"Protestant side--neatness, cheerfulness, industry, education, continued"
"aspiration, at least, after better things. On the Catholic side--dirt,"
"disease, ignorance, squalor and misery. I have so constantly observed"
the like of this since I came abroad that I have a sad misgiving that
"the religion of Ireland lies at the root of all its sorrows."" Writing"

exorcising the spirits of evil that held him in their torturing grip.
"He spoke but little at the meal, content to listen to the talk about"
"Stella, and curiously impatient when the conversation drifted into other"
"channels. Of his own tragedy no one spoke. On his arrival, Lady Blount,"
"with unwonted demonstration of affection, had thrown her arms round his"
"neck, and Sir Oliver had wrung his hand and mumbled the stiff Briton's"
incoherences of sympathy. He had not yet told them of his decision to go
to Australia.
"He broke the news later, in the drawing-room, abruptly and apropos of"
"nothing, as was his manner, firing his bombshell with the defiant air of"
"one who says, “There, what do you think of it?”"
"“I'm going to Australia next week, never to come back again,” said he."
There was a discussion. Sir Oliver commended him. The great dependencies
"of the empire were the finest field in the world for a young man,"
provided he kept himself outside the radius of the venomous blight of
the Colonial Office. To that atrophied branch of the imperial service
"the white administrator was merely a pigeon-holed automaton; the native,"
"black or bronze or yellow, a lion-hearted human creature. All the"
"murder, riot, rapine, arson, and other heterogeneous devilry that"
the latter cared to indulge in proceeded naturally from the noble
indignation of his generous nature. If the sensible man who was
appointed by the Government to rule over this scum of the planet called
out the military and wiped out a few dozen of them for the greater glory
"and safety of the empire, the pusillanimous ineptitudes in second-rate"
"purple and cheap linen of the Colonial Office, for the sake of currying"
favour with Labour members and Socialists and Radicals and Methodists

I speak from personal experience; and when I look back upon the
"reviews I wrote ten years ago, it is with invariable consternation,"
and sometimes a real sense of shame.
"Nevertheless, there is some criticism of the religious novel which"
must be taken seriously. I have maintained that men generally in
"England are in a state of theological confusion, but that they are"
interested in religion if they can be induced to consider it. There
"is, as the great African Presbyter wrote seventeen hundred years ago,"
a natural response in the hearts of men to the chief articles of the
Christian Faith. There is a _Testimonium animæ naturaliter
christianæ_. But there are some who can only be described by a
quotation: “They are the enemies of the cross of Christ.” They are
determined that the Catholic creed shall have no place in the counsels
and considerations of social legislation. Of Jesus Christ they have
"said, “We will not have this man to reign over us;” and if there be"
any chance that a man’s books may catch the eye of the public and
"rouse people to think whether opportunism is really statesmanship, and"
"empiricism in politics really prudent, if, in a word, the principles"
"of Christianity are offered as a solution of social problems, then"
the author is attacked on every side. It is suggested that his
"intention is insincere, that his knowledge is inadequate. The things"
which have been part of his painful discipline and development are
described as his accepted environment. If a Bishop happens to find an
"illustration for a sermon in his pages, or a prominent Nonconformist"
"divine recognizes that the laity like to read them, and says so; if"
any of those true hearts who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
"have been ready to see that men who have been rescued _de profundis_,"
men who have had experience of [Greek: ta bathea tou satana] are not
"thereby disqualified for duty in the field of Faith; if, in a word,"
"of later days, Sir William Hamilton, whose monumental learning created"
"him a reputation while still an undergraduate. Sir Roundell Palmer,"
"afterwards Lord Selborne, was a contemporary of Ferrier's at Oxford;"
Sheriff Campbell Smith was at the bar of the House of Lords acting as
"Palmer's junior the day after Ferrier's death, and Sir Roundell told"
him that he remembered Ferrier well at College; he described him as
"'careless about University work,' but as writing clever verses, several"
of which he repeated with considerable gusto. Of other friends the
"names alone are preserved, William Edward Collins, afterwards"
"Collins-Wood of Keithick, Perthshire, who died in 1877, and J. P."
"Shirley of Ettington Park, in Warwickshire;[3] but what influences were"
"brought to bear upon him by his University life, or whether his"
interest in philosophical pursuits were in any way aroused during his
"time at College, we have no means of telling. A later friend, Henry"
"Inglis, wrote of these early days: 'My friendship with Ferrier began"
"about the time he was leaving Oxford, or immediately after he had left"
it--I should say about 1830 or thereabout. At that University I don't
think he did anything more remarkable than contracting a large tailor's
bill; which annoyed him for many years afterwards. At that time he was
"a wonderfully handsome, intellectual-looking young man,--a tremendous"
"""swell"" from top to toe, and with his hair hanging down over his"
shoulders.' Though later on in life this last characteristic was not so
"marked, Ferrier's photographs show his hair still fairly long and"
"brushed off a finely-modelled square forehead, such as is usually"
associated with strongly developed intellectual faculties.
"[2] The gentlemen-commoners at Magdalen, as elsewhere, paid"
higher fees and wore a distinctive costume; at Magdalen they
"had a common room of their own, distinct from that of the"
"Fellows, or the Demies or Scholars, and seldom read for"
honours. In Ferrier's days Magdalen College admitted no
"ordinary commoners, and there were but few resident"
but more or less successfully suppressed action.']
"[Footnote 80: This seems to me to be the answer to the question, asked"
"by Freud, (_Die Traumdeutung_, p. 227), why we do not always dream of"
"inhibited movement. Freud considers that the idea of inhibited movement,"
"when it occurs in dreams, has no relation to the actual condition of the"
"dreamer's nervous system, but is simply an ideatory symbol of an erotic"
wish that is no longer capable of fulfilment. But it is certain that
sleep is not always at the same depth and that the various nervous groups
are not always equally asleep. A dream arising on the basis of partial
and imperfect sleep can scarcely fail to lead to the attempt at actual
"movement and the more or less complete inhibition of that movement,"
"presenting a struggle which is often visible to the onlooker, and is not"
purely ideatory.]
"[Footnote 81: This explanation, based on the depth and kind of the sleep,"
is entirely distinct from the theory of Aliotta (_Il Pensiero e la
"Personalità nei Sogni_, 1905), who believes that dreamers differ according"
"to their nervous type, the person of visual type assisting passively at"
"the spectacle of his dreams, while the person of motor type takes actual"
"part in them. I have no evidence of this, though I believe that dreams"
differ in accordance with the dreamer's personal type.]
[Footnote 82: Dugald Stewart argued that there is loss of control over
"the muscular system during sleep, and the body, therefore, is not subject"
to our command; volition is present but it cannot influence the limbs.
"Hammond argued, on the contrary, that Stewart was quite wrong; the reason"
"why voluntary movements are not performed during sleep is, he said, that"
volition is suspended. 'We do not will our actions when we are asleep. We
"imagine that we do, and that is all' (_Treatise on Insanity_, p. 205)."
"Dugald Stewart and Hammond, though their phraseology may have been too"
"metaphysical, were, from the standpoint I have adopted, both maintaining"
heritage of our national culture through the medium of our own
literature. I was thus to consider myself one with the people and never
to place myself in an equivocal position of assumed superiority. This I
realised more particularly when later I wished to go to Europe and to
"compete for the Indian Civil Service, his refusal as regards that"
"particular career was absolute. I was to rule nobody but myself, I was"
to be a scholar not an administrator.
THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
There has been some complaint that the experiment of meeting out cut and
dried moral texts as a part of school routine has not proved to be so
effective as was expected by their promulgators. The moral education
which we received in our childhood was very indirect and came from
listening to stories recited by the 'Kathas' on various incidents
connected with our great epics. Their effect on our minds was very
great; this may be because our racial memory makes us more prone to
respond to certain ideals that have been impressed on the consciousness
of the nation. These early appeals to our emotions have remained
persistent; the only difference is that which was there as a narrative
"of incidents more or less historical, is now realised as eternally true,"
being an allegory of the unending struggle of the human soul in its
choice between what is material and that other something which
transcends it. The only pictures now in my study are a few frescoes done
for me by Abanindra Nath Tagore and Nanda Lal Bose. The first fresco
"represents Her, who is the Sustainer of the Universe. She stands"
pedestalled on the lotus of our heart. The world was at peace; but a
change has come. And She under whose Veil of Compassion we had been
"protected so long, suddenly flings us to the world of conflict. Our"
"great epic, the Mahabharata, deals with this great conflict, and the few"
frescoes delineate some of the fundamental incidents. The coming of the
afternoon _The Bedford Castle_ lay at her moorings subjected to the
"customary eleventh-hour delays. As the time dragged on, and the liquor"
"died in the fishermen, it became a herculean task to prevent them from"
"issuing forth into the street, while the crowds outside seemed"
possessed of a desperate determination to force an entrance and bring
the issue to a final settlement. But across the shore end of the dock a
double cordon was drawn which hurled back the intruders at every
advance.
"The fishermen who remained inside the barnlike structure, unable to"
"come at their enemies, fought among themselves, bidding fair to wreck"
"the building in the extravagance of their delirium, while outside the"
rival faction kept up a fire of missiles and execrations. As the hours
"crept onward the tension increased, and at last Boyd turned to Captain"
"Peasley saying, ""You'd better be ready to pull out at any minute, for"
"if the mob breaks in we'll never be able to hold these maniacs."" He"
"pointed to the black swarm aloft, whence issued hoarse waves of sound."
"""I don't like the look of things, a little bit."""
"""They are a trifle strained, to be sure,"" the Captain acknowledged."
"""I'll stand by to cast off at your signal, so you'd better pass the"
"word around."""
"Boyd left the ship and went to the dock-office, for there still"
remained one thing to be done: he could not leave without sounding a
final note of triumph for Mildred. How sweet it would be to her ears he
"knew full well, yet he could not help wondering if she would feel the"
thrill that mastered him at this moment. As he saw the empty spaces
where had stood those masses of freight which he had gathered at such
"cost, as he heard his own men bellowing defiance at his enemies and"
"realized that his first long stride toward success had been taken, his"
heart swelled with gladness and the breath caught momentarily in his
But he who has surmounted his patriotism and has attained complete
impartiality would not selfishly claim the only benefit of war entirely
"for his own country, but would desire all to share it alike, and would"
therefore wish defeat for every warring nation.
If a horde of British and a horde of German soldiers engage in mutual
"butchery, and if the maimed, broken remnants of the British horde have"
"just enough order left to drive back the remnants of the German horde,"
leaving innumerable dead and wounded and for ever darkening the lives of
"countless friends and wives--in other words, if the British army wins"
"what our infamous Press would call a ""glorious victory""--then all that"
is evil in the life of the nation is encouraged and justified. It is
then that the diplomatists who lied and schemed to bring on the
"monstrous event, that all the politicians who exploit and foster the"
"nation's madness and misery to enhance their own reputations, that those"
"who batten on the slaughter, and that those who glorify the carnage at"
"a safe distance and fight the enemy with their lying tongues, are"
"justified. They all are justified. But if, instead of victory, there is"
"defeat, then they tremble lest they should be disgraced and lose their"
"places, lest they should be victims of a disillusioned people's anger,"
"lest they should forfeit their plunder, lest they should be called to"
account for the lies with which they fooled the masses. Defeat is the
"defeat of evil, victory is the victory of evil."

A second batch of papers arrived. The German advance was continuing. The
British reverse was becoming catastrophic. At first I felt a kind of
"grimness, and then I was thrilled by the thought that perhaps the end of"
"the war might be near. We might not have a good peace, but peace of any"
kind was preferable to war. The mendacious Press talked much about a
"""dishonourable peace,"" as though any peace could be as dishonourable as"
ideas is concerned. He does not hold that all sensation is a percept
"involving extension and much else--involving, indeed, existence."
"Following upon Reid, Dugald Stewart obtained a very considerable"
"reputation, and he was living and writing at the time Ferrier was a"
"young man. His main idea would, however, seem to have been to guard his"
"utterances carefully, and enter upon no keen discussions or"
"contentions: when a bold assertion is made, it is always under shelter"
of some good authority. But his rounded phrases gained him considerable
"admiration, as such writing often does. He carried--perhaps"
inadvertently--Reid's views farther than he would probably have held as
"justifiable. He says we are not, properly speaking, conscious of self"
"or the existence of self, but merely of a sensation or some other"
"quality, which, by a _subsequent suggestion_ of the understanding,"
leads to a belief in that which exercises the quality. This is the
"doctrine of Reid put very crudely, and in a manner calculated to bring"
us back to unrelated sensation in earnest. Stewart adopted a new
"expression for Reid's 'common-sense,' _i.e._ the 'fundamental laws of"
"belief,' which might be less ambiguous, but never took popular hold as"
did the first.
There were many others belonging to this school besides Reid and
"Stewart, whom it would be impossible to speak of here. The Scottish"
"Philosophy had its work to do, and no doubt understood that work--the"
first essential in a criticism: it endeavoured to vindicate perception
"as against sensational idealism, and it only partially succeeded in its"
task. But we must be careful not to forget that it opened up the way
for a more comprehensive and satisfactory point of view. It was with
Kant that the distinction arose between sensation and the forms
"necessary to its perception, the form of space and time, and so on. As"
"to this part of the theory of knowledge, Reid and his school were not"
clear; they only made an effort to express the fact that something was
Vivie's health gradually recovered from the effects of the forcible
"feeding; the prison fare, supplemented by the weekly parcels, suited"
her digestion; the peace of the prison life and the regular work at
interesting trades soothed her nerves. She enjoyed the respite from
"the worries of her complicated toilettes, the perplexity of what to"
"wear and how to wear it; in short, she was finding a spell of prison"
"life quite bearable, except for the cold and the attentions of the"
chaplain. She gathered from the fortnightly letter which her
"industry and good conduct allowed her to receive, and to answer,"
that unwearied efforts were being made by her friends outside to
shorten her sentence. Mrs. Warren through Bertie Adams had found out
the cases where jockeys and stable lads had lost their effects in
the fires or explosions which had followed Vivie's visits to their
"employers' premises, and had made good their losses. As to their"
"employers, they had all been heavily insured, and recovered the"
value of their buildings; and as to the insurance companies _they_
had all been so enriched by Mr. Lloyd George's legislation that the
"one-or-two hundred thousand pounds they had lost, through Vivie's"
"revenge for the seemingly-fruitless death of Emily Wilding Davison,"
was a bagatelle not worth bothering about. But all attempts to get
the Home Office to reconsider Miss Warren's case or to shorten her
imprisonment (except by the abridgment that could be earned in the
prison itself) were unavailing. So long as the Cabinet held Vivie
"under lock and key, the Suffrage movement--they foolishly"
believed--was hamstrung.
"So the months went by, and Vivie almost lost count of time and"
"almost became content to wait. Till War was declared on August 4th,"
1914. A few days afterwards followed the amnesty to Suffragist
prisoners. From this the Home Office strove at first to exclude
Vivien Warren on the plea that her crime was an ordinary crime and
admitted of no political justification; but at this the wrath of
"effort must be made if affairs were to be placed on a better footing,"
and if a protest were to be raised against the cynical criticism in
"which the Reviewers indulged. Consequently, in April 1817, a literary"
periodical called the _Edinburgh Monthly Magazine_ was started by two
"gentlemen of some experience in literary matters, with the assistance"
"of Mr. William Blackwood, an enterprising Edinburgh publisher, whose"
reputation had grown of recent years to considerable dimensions. This
magazine was not a great success: the editors and publisher did not
"agree, and finally Mr. Blackwood purchased the formers' share in it,"
"took over the magazine himself, and, to make matters clear, gave it his"
name; thus in October of the same year the first number of _Blackwood's
Edinburgh Magazine_ appeared. From a quiet and unobtrusive 'Miscellany'
"the magazine developed into a strongly partisan periodical, with a"
"brilliant array of young contributors, determined to oppose the"
"_Edinburgh Review_ régime with all its might, and not afraid to speak"
its mind respecting the literary gods of the day. Every month some one
"came to their ears as Miss Higgins, who had charge of the little"
"group, posed them against an old, overturned dory. ""A perfect"
"type--native--girls----freedom----wild beauty----"" She resented the"
"rotting dory. Vick had leaned against a crimson velvet chair. Why,"
"her hair had not been combed since the morning before, her skirt"
was in tatters where she had torn it climbing into Top Notch; she
"was horribly conscious of her long legs, bare, brown, and bruised."
Sidney found that posing in the morning sun on a beach at Provincetown
was not the lark Vick had declared posing for the great Stuart Gelding
had been. But then Vick had flirted a little with Stuart Gelding and
had always had a cup of tea with him and his wife afterward; these art
students appeared to have forgotten that their models were human with
legs that ached from holding a position and arms that trembled with
very eagerness to move. It was not one bit of fun.
"as ""totally distinct from the Icelandic,"" Celtic influence is also"
specified as affecting Norse literature in general. The first
"generations of Icelandic poets were men of good birth, ""nearly"
"always, too, of Celtic blood on one side at least""; and they went"
"to Norway or Denmark, where they lived as kings' or chiefs'"
"henchmen. The immigration of Norse settlers from Ireland, too,"
"affected the Iceland stock very early. ""It is to the west that the"
best sagas belong: it is to the west that nearly every classic
writer whose name we know belongs; and it is precisely in the west
"that the admixture of Irish blood is greatest"" (_ib._). The facts"
"seem decisive, and the statements above cited appear the more"
clearly to need modification. It is to be noted that Schweitzer's
_Geschichte der skandinavischen Literatur_ gives no hint of the
Celtic influence.
But the Icelandic civilisation as a whole could not indefinitely
progress on its own basis any more than the Irish. Beyond a certain
point both needed new light and leading; for the primeval spirit of
"strife never spontaneously weakened; the original Icelandic stock being,"
"to begin with, a selection of revolters from over-rule. So continual"
domestic feuds checked mental evolution in Iceland as in old
Scandinavia; and the reduction of the island to Norwegian rule in the
thirteenth century could not do more for it than monarchy was doing for
Norway. Mere Christianity without progressive conditions of culture
availed less for imaginative art than free paganism had done; and when
"higher culture-contacts became possible, the extreme poverty of Iceland"
tended more than ever to send the enterprising people where the culture
and comfort were. It is in fact not a possible seat for a relatively
flourishing civilisation in the period of peaceful development. The
Reformation seems there to have availed for very little indeed. It was
"vehemently resisted,[690] but carried by the preponderant acquisitive"
"forces: ""nearly all who took part in it were men of low type, moved by"
potentialities of his race for evolving modes of expression demanded by
the period of transition in which he was placed. They found expression
"in great constructive work, in the restoration of quiet amidst disorder,"
"in the earliest effort to spread education both among men and women, in"
"questions of social welfare, in industrial efforts, in the establishment"
of people's Bank and in the foundation of industrial and technical
schools. And behind all these efforts lay a burning love for his country
and its nobler traditions.
MATTERS EDUCATIONAL
In educational matters he had very definite ideas which is now becoming
more fully appreciated. English schools were at that time not only
regarded as the only efficient medium for instruction. While my father's
subordinates sent their children to the English schools intended for
"gentle folks, I was sent to the vernacular school where my comrades were"
"hardy sons of toilers and of others who, it is now the fashion to"
"regard, were belonging to the depressed classes. From these who tilled"
the ground and made the land blossom with green verdure and ripening
"corn, and the sons of the fisher folk, who told stories of the strange"
creatures that frequented the unknown depths of mighty rivers and
"stagnant pools, I first derived the lesson of that which constitutes"
true manhood. From them too I drew my love of nature. When I came home
accompanied by my comrades I found my mother waiting for us. She was an
"orthodox Hindu, yet the ""untouchableness"" of some of my school fellows"
did not produce any misgivings in her. She welcomed and fed all these as
her own children; for it is only true of the mother heart to go out and
enfold in her protecting care all those who needed succour and a
mother's affection. I now realise the object of my being sent at the
"most plastic period of my life to the vernacular school, where I was to"
"learn my own language, to think my own thoughts and to receive the"
jewels worn by an Isis of ancient Cadiz;[68] her ornaments were more
brilliant than those of a Spanish madonna.
"During the entire forenoon, from the moment that a noisy acclamation had"
"greeted the rising of the sun, the images of the gods were exposed to the"
silent adoration of the initiates.[69] Egypt is the country whence
"contemplative devotion penetrated into Europe. Then, in the afternoon, a"
second service was held to close the sanctuary.[70]
The daily liturgy must have been very absorbing. This innovation in the
Roman paganism was full of consequences. No longer were sacrifices offered
"to the god on certain occasions only, but twice a day elaborate services"
"were held. As with the Egyptians, whom Herodotus had termed the most"
"religious of all peoples,[71] devotion assumed a tendency to fill out the"
whole existence and to dominate private and public interests. The constant
"repetition of the same prayers {97} kept up and renewed faith, and, we"
"might say, people lived continually under the eyes of the gods."
Besides the daily rites of the Abydos liturgy the holidays marking the
beginning of the different seasons were celebrated at the same date every
year.[72] It was the same in Italy. The calendars have preserved the names
"of several of them, and of one, the _Navigium Isidis_, the rhetorician"
"Apuleius[73] has left us a brilliant description on which, to speak with"
"the ancients, he emptied all his color tubes. On March 5th, when navigation"
"reopened after the winter months, a gorgeous procession[74] marched to the"
"coast, and a ship consecrated to Isis, the protectress of sailors, was"
"launched. A burlesque group of masked persons opened the procession, then"
"came the women in white gowns strewing flowers, the _stolistes_ waving the"
garments of the goddess and the _dadophori_ with lighted torches. After
"these came the _hymnodes_, whose songs mingled in turn with the sharp sound"
of the cross-flutes and the ringing of the brass timbrels; then the throngs
"of the initiates, and finally the priests, with shaven heads and clad in"
revolted unsubduably against his son is to be explained in terms of
certain circumstances little stressed in popular historiography. In the
"narratives of the rhetorical historians, no real explanation arises. The"
revolt figures as a stand for personal and religious freedom. But when
"Charles abdicated, after slaying his thousands, the Reformation had been"
in full tide for over thirty years; Calvin had built up Protestant
Geneva to the point of burning Servetus; England had been for twenty
"years depapalised; France, with many scholars and nobles converted to"
"Calvinism, was on the verge of a civil war of Huguenots and Catholics;"
the Netherlands themselves had been drenched in the blood of heretics;
and still no leading man had thought of repudiating either Spain or
"Rome. Yet within thirteen years they were in full revolt, led by William"
"of Orange, now turned Protestant. Seeing that mere popular Protestantism"
"had spread far and gone fast, religious opinion was clearly not the"
determining force.
"In reality, the _conditio sine qua non_ was the psychological reversal"
"effected by Philip when he elected to rule as a Spaniard, where his"
father had in effect ruled as a Fleming. Charles had always figured as a
"native of the Netherlands, at home among his people, friendly to their"
"great men, ready to employ them in his affairs, even to the extent of"
partly ruling Spain through them. After his punishment of Ghent they
were his boon subjects; and in his youth it was the Spaniards who were
jealous of the Flemish and Dutch. This state of things had begun under
"his Flemish-German father, Philip I, who became King of Spain by"
"marriage, and under whom the Netherland nobles showed in Spain a"
rapacity that infuriated the Spaniards against them. It was a question
simply of racial predominance; and had the dynasty chosen to fix its
"capital in the north rather than in the south, it would have been the"
lot of the Netherlanders to exploit Spain--a task for which they were
perfectly ready.
"America a very uncomfortable country, unless he happens to be an eminent"
writer. Exactly the same kind of restraints upon freedom of thought are
bound to occur in every country where economic organization has been
carried to the point of practical monopoly. Therefore the safeguarding
of liberty in the world which is growing up is far more difficult than
"it was in the nineteenth century, when free competition was still a"
reality. Whoever cares about the freedom of the mind must face this
"situation fully and frankly, realizing the inapplicability of methods"
which answered well enough while industrialism was in its infancy.
"There are two simple principles which, if they were adopted, would solve"
almost all social problems. The first is that education should have for
one of its aims to teach people only to believe propositions when there
is some reason to think that they are true. The second is that jobs
should be given solely for fitness to do the work.
To take the second point first. The habit of considering a man’s
"religious, moral, and political opinions before appointing him to a post"
"or giving him a job is the modern form of persecution, and it is likely"
to become quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was. The old
liberties can be legally retained without being of the slightest use.
"If, in practice, certain opinions lead a man to starve, it is poor"
comfort to him to know that his opinions are not punishable by law.
There is a certain public feeling against starving men for not belonging
"to the Church of England, or for holding slightly unorthodox opinions in"
politics. But there is hardly any feeling against the rejection of
"Atheists or Mormons, extreme communists, or men who advocate free love."
"Such men are thought to be wicked, and it is considered only natural to"
refuse to employ them. People have hardly yet waked up to the fact that
"this refusal, in a highly industrial State, amounts to a very rigorous"
form of persecution.
to lead it back from the now turbid pools to those living and most pure
"fountain-heads, those most limpid sources of gospel doctrine--thus he"
saw the task of divinity. The metaphor of the limpid water is not
without meaning here; it reveals the psychological quality of Erasmus's
fervent principle.
"'How is it', he exclaims, 'that people give themselves so much trouble"
about the details of all sorts of remote philosophical systems and
neglect to go to the sources of Christianity itself?' 'Although this
"wisdom, which is so excellent that once for all it put the wisdom of all"
"the world to shame, may be drawn from these few books, as from a"
"crystalline source, with far less trouble than is the wisdom of"
Aristotle from so many thorny books and with much more fruit.... The
equipment for that journey is simple and at everyone's immediate
disposal. This philosophy is accessible to everybody. Christ desires
that his mysteries shall be spread as widely as possible. I should wish
that all good wives read the Gospel and Paul's Epistles; that they were
translated into all languages; that out of these the husbandman sang
"while ploughing, the weaver at his loom; that with such stories the"
traveller should beguile his wayfaring.... This sort of philosophy is
"rather a matter of disposition than of syllogisms, rather of life than"
"of disputation, rather of inspiration than of erudition, rather of"
"transformation than of logic.... What is the philosophy of Christ, which"
"he himself calls _Renascentia_, but the insaturation of Nature created"
"good?--moreover, though no one has taught us this so absolutely and"
"effectively as Christ, yet also in pagan books much may be found that is"
in accordance with it.'
Such was the view of life of this biblical humanist. As often as Erasmus
"reverts to these matters, his voice sounds clearest. 'Let no one', he"
"says in the preface to the notes to the New Testament, 'take up this"
"work, as he takes up Gellius's _Noctes atticae_ or Poliziano's"
"issue. Definite mis-statements of fact can be legitimately objected to,"
"but they are by no means necessary. The mere words “Pear’s Soap,” which"
"affirm nothing, cause people to buy that article. If, wherever these"
"words appear, they were replaced by the words “The Labour Party,”"
"millions of people would be led to vote for the Labour Party, although"
the advertisements had claimed no merit for it whatever. But if both
sides in a controversy were confined by law to statements which a
"committee of eminent logicians considered relevant and valid, the main"
"evil of propaganda, as at present conducted, would remain. Suppose,"
"under such a law, two parties with an equally good case, one of whom had"
"a million pounds to spend on propaganda, while the other had only a"
hundred thousand. It is obvious that the arguments in favour of the
richer party would become more widely known than those in favour of the
"poorer party, and therefore the richer party would win. This situation"
"is, of course, intensified when one party is the Government. In Russia"
"the Government has an almost complete monopoly of propaganda, but that"
is not necessary. The advantages which it possesses over its opponents
"will generally be sufficient to give it the victory, unless it has an"
exceptionally bad case.
"The objection to propaganda is not only its appeal to unreason, but"
still more the unfair advantage which it gives to the rich and powerful.
Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if there is to be
real freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity among opinions can
"only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end, which there is"
no reason to expect to see enacted. The cure is not to be sought
"primarily in such laws, but in better education and a more sceptical"
"public opinion. For the moment, however, I am not concerned to discuss"
cures.
(3) _Economic pressure._—I have already dealt with some aspects of this
"obstacle to freedom of thought, but I wish now to deal with it on more"
New York are the best that have ever existed on this planet; yet even
then both would presumably be capable of improvement. Any person who
admits this obvious proposition is by law incapable of teaching in a
State school. Thus the law decrees that the teachers shall all be either
hypocrites or fools.
The growing danger exemplified by the New York law is that resulting
"from the monopoly of power in the hands of a single organization,"
whether the State or a Trust or federation of Trusts. In the case of
"education, the power is in the hands of the State, which can prevent the"
young from hearing of any doctrine which it dislikes. I believe there
are still some people who think that a democratic State is scarcely
"distinguishable from the people. This, however, is a delusion. The State"
"is a collection of officials, different for different purposes, drawing"
comfortable incomes so long as the _status quo_ is preserved. The only
alteration they are likely to desire in the _status quo_ is an increase
"of bureaucracy and of the power of bureaucrats. It is, therefore,"
natural that they should take advantage of such opportunities as war
"excitement to acquire inquisitorial powers over their employees,"
involving the right to inflict starvation upon any subordinate who
"opposes them. In matters of the mind, such as education, this state of"
affairs is fatal. It puts an end to all possibility of progress or
freedom or intellectual initiative. Yet it is the natural result of
allowing the whole of elementary education to fall under the sway of a
single organization.
"Religious toleration, to a certain extent, has been won because people"
have ceased to consider religion so important as it was once thought to
"be. But in politics and economics, which have taken the place formerly"
"occupied by religion, there is a growing tendency to persecution, which"
is not by any means confined to one party. The persecution of opinion in
Russia is more severe than in any capitalist country. I met in Petrograd
strongly felt the attraction of a marvelous country where everything was
"mysterious, from the Nile that had created it to the hieroglyphs engraved"
upon the walls of its gigantic edifices.[10] At the same time they were
shocked by the coarseness of its fetichism and by the absurdity of its
superstitions. Above all they felt an unconquerable repulsion at the
"worship of animals and plants, which had always been the most striking"
"feature of the vulgar Egyptian religion and which, like all other archaic"
"devotions, seems to have been practised with renewed fervor after the"
accession of the Saite dynasty. The comic writers and the satirists never
"tired of scoffing at the adorers of the cat, the crocodile, the leek and"
"the onion. Juvenal says ironically: ""O holy people, whose very"
"kitchen-gardens produce gods.""[11] In a general way, this strange people,"
"entirely separated from the remainder of the world, were regarded with"
about the same kind of feeling that Europeans entertained toward the
Chinese for a long time.
A purely Egyptian worship would not have been acceptable to the Greco-Latin
world. The main merit of the mixed creation of the political genius of the
Ptolemies consisted in the rejection or modification of everything
"repugnant or monstrous like the phallophories of Abydos, and in the"
retention of none but {79} stirring or attractive elements. It was the most
civilized of all barbarian religions; it retained enough of the exotic
"element to arouse the curiosity of the Greeks, but not enough to offend"
"their delicate sense of proportion, and its success was remarkable."
It was adopted wherever the authority or the prestige of the Lagides was
"felt, and wherever the relations of Alexandria, the great commercial"
"metropolis, extended. The Lagides induced the rulers and the nations with"
whom they concluded alliances to accept it. King Nicocreon introduced it
"into Cyprus after having consulted the oracle of the Serapeum,[12] and"
"Agathocles introduced it into Sicily, at the time of his marriage with the"
"daughter-in-law of Ptolemy I (298).[13] At Antioch, Seleucus Callinicus"
"an eminent Russian poet, Alexander Block, who has since died as the"
"result of privations. The Bolsheviks allowed him to teach æsthetics, but"
he complained that they insisted on his teaching the subject “from a
Marxian point of view.” He had been at a loss to discover how the theory
"of rhythmics was connected with Marxism, although, to avoid starvation,"
"he had done his best to find out. Of course, it has been impossible in"
Russia ever since the Bolsheviks came into power to print anything
critical of the dogmas upon which their regime is founded.
The examples of America and Russia illustrate the conclusion to which we
"seem to be driven—namely, that so long as men continue to have the"
present fanatical belief in the importance of politics free thought on
"political matters will be impossible, and there is only too much danger"
"that the lack of freedom will spread to all other matters, as it has"
done in Russia. Only some degree of political scepticism can save us
from this misfortune.
It must not be supposed that the officials in charge of education desire
"the young to become educated. On the contrary, their problem is to"
impart information without imparting intelligence. Education should have
"two objects: first, to give definite knowledge—reading and writing,"
"languages and mathematics, and so on; secondly, to create those mental"
habits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and form sound
"judgments for themselves. The first of these we may call information,"
the second intelligence. The utility of information is admitted
practically as well as theoretically; without a literate population a
modern State is impossible. But the utility of intelligence is admitted
"only theoretically, not practically; it is not desired that ordinary"
"people should think for themselves, because it is felt that people who"
think for themselves are awkward to manage and cause administrative
"difficulties. Only the guardians, in Plato’s language, are to think; the"
"rest are to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of sheep. This"
the coarse by the long action of strong waves and tides. The sands
and clays have undergone little more sorting than is done by
rivers. We must regard the Chemung sandstones as deposits made at
"the mouths of swift, turbid rivers in such great amount that they"
could be little sorted and distributed by waves.
Over considerable areas the Chemung sandstones bear little or no
"trace of the action of the sea. The Catskill Mountains, for"
"example, have as their summit layers some three thousand feet of"
"coarse red sandstones of this series, whose structure is that of"
"river deposits, and whose few fossils are chiefly of fresh-water"
"types. The Chemung is therefore composed of delta deposits, more"
or less worked over by the sea. The bulk of the Chemung equals
that of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To furnish this immense
"volume of sediment a great mountain range, or highland, must have"
been upheaved where the Appalachian lowland long had been. To what
height the Devonian mountains of Appalachia attained cannot be
"told from the volume of the sediments wasted from them, for they"
may have risen but little faster than they were worn down by
denudation. We may infer from the character of the waste which
they furnished to the Chemung shores that they did not reach an
Alpine height. The grains of the Chemung sandstones are not those
"which would result from mechanical disintegration, as by frost on"
"high mountain peaks, but are rather those which would be left from"
the long chemical decay of siliceous crystalline rocks; for the
more soluble minerals are largely wanting. The red color of much
of the deposits points to the same conclusion. Red residual clays
"accumulated on the mountain sides and upland summits, and were"
washed as ocherous silt to mingle with the delta sands. The iron-
bearing igneous rocks of the oldland also contributed by their
"decay iron in solution to the rivers, to be deposited in films of"
"iron oxide about the quartz grains of the Chemung sandstones,"
together we shall be able to shake the odious yoke from off the neck
"of Corsica."""
But there was another work which exercised a great influence on his
"young mind--the ""Gallic War"" of Cæsar. To the young Italian the"
conquest of Gaul by a man of his own race must have been a congenial
"topic, and in Cæsar himself the future conqueror may dimly have"
recognized a kindred spirit. The masterful energy and all-conquering
"will of the old Roman, his keen insight into the heart of a problem,"
"the wide sweep of his mental vision, ranging over the intrigues of the"
"Roman Senate, the shifting politics of a score of tribes, and the"
myriad administrative details of a great army and a mighty
province--these were the qualities that furnished the chief mental
"training to the young cadet. Indeed, the career of Cæsar was destined"
"to exert a singular fascination over the Napoleonic dynasty, not only"
"on its founder, but also on Napoleon III.; and the change in the"
character and career of Napoleon the Great may be registered mentally
in the effacement of the portraits of Leonidas and Paoli by those of
"Cæsar and Alexander. Later on, during his sojourn at Ajaccio in 1790,"
when the first shadows were flitting across his hitherto unclouded
"love for Paoli, we hear that he spent whole nights poring over Cæsar's"
"history, committing many passages to memory in his passionate"
admiration of those wondrous exploits. Eagerly he took Cæsar's side as
"against Pompey, and no less warmly defended him from the charge of"
plotting against the liberties of the commonwealth[6]. It was a
perilous study for a republican youth in whom the military instincts
were as ingrained as the genius for rule.
Concerning the young Buonaparte's life at Brienne there exist few
"authentic records and many questionable anecdotes. Of these last, that"
which is the most credible and suggestive relates his proposal to his
schoolfellows to construct ramparts of snow during the sharp winter of
the public ceremonies there was a secret worship to which one was admitted
only after a gradual initiation. The hero of Apuleius had to submit to the
ordeal three times in order to obtain the whole revelation. In Egypt the
{99} clergy communicated certain rites and interpretations only upon a
promise not to reveal them. In fact this was the case in the worship of
Isis at Abydos and elsewhere.[78] When the Ptolemies regulated the Greek
"ritual of their new religion, it assumed the form of the mysteries spread"
over the Hellenic world and became very like those of Eleusis. The hand of
the Eumolpid Timotheus is noticeable in this connection.[79]
But while the ceremonial of the initiations and even the production of the
"liturgic drama were thus adapted to the religious habits of the Greeks, the"
doctrinal contents of the Alexandrian mysteries remained purely Egyptian.
The old belief that immortality could be secured by means of an
identification of the deceased with Osiris or Serapis never died out.
Perhaps in no other people did the epigram of Fustel de Coulanges find so
"complete a verification as in the Egyptians: ""Death was the first mystery;"
"it started man on the road to the other mysteries.""[80] Nowhere else was"
life so completely dominated by preoccupation with life after death;
nowhere else was such minute and complicated care taken to secure and
"perpetuate another existence for the deceased. The funeral literature, of"
"which we have found a very great number of documents, had acquired a"
"development equaled by no other, and the architecture of no other nation"
can exhibit tombs comparable with the pyramids or the rock-built sepulchers
of Thebes.
This constant endeavor to secure an after-existence for one's self and
"relatives manifested itself in various ways, but it finally assumed a"
"concrete form in the worship of Osiris. The fate of Osiris, the god who"
"died and returned to life, became the prototype of the {100} fate of every"
"human being that observed the funeral rites. ""As truly as Osiris lives,"""
"years; we can read its sacred texts, mythical narratives, hymns, rituals,"
"and the Book of the Dead in the original, and we can ascertain its various"
ideas as to the nature of the divine powers and of future life. A great
number of monuments have preserved for our inspection the pictures of
"divinities and representations of liturgic scenes, while numerous"
inscriptions and papyri enlighten us in regard to the sacerdotal
organization of the principal temples. It would seem that the enormous
quantity of documents of all kinds that have been deciphered in the course
of nearly an entire century should have dispelled every uncertainty about
"the creed of ancient Egypt, and should have furnished exact information"
with regard to the sources and original character of the worship which the
Greeks and the Romans borrowed from the subjects of the Ptolemies.
"And yet, this is not the case. While of the four great Oriental religions"
"which were transplanted into the Occident, the religion of Isis and Serapis"
is the one whose relation to the ancient belief of the mother country we
"can establish with greatest accuracy, we {74} know very little of its first"
"form and of its nature before the imperial period, when it was held in high"
esteem.
"One fact, however, appears to be certain. The Egyptian worship that spread"
over the Greco-Roman world came from the Serapeum founded at Alexandria by
"Ptolemy Soter, somewhat in the manner of Judaism that emanated from the"
temple of Jerusalem. But the earliest history of that famous sanctuary is
"surrounded by such a thick growth of pious legends, that the most sagacious"
"investigators have lost their way in it. Was Serapis of native origin, or"
"was he imported from Sinope or Seleucia, or even from Babylon? Each of"
these opinions has found supporters very recently. Is his name derived from
"that of the Egyptian god Osiris-Apis, or from that of the Chaldean deity"
Sar-Apsi? _Grammatici certant_.[1]
"Whichever solution we may adopt, one fact remains, namely, that Serapis and"
"blood, as the principle of life, was no longer supposed to renew physical"
"energy, but to cause a temporary or even an eternal rebirth of the soul."
"The descent into the pit was regarded as burial, a melancholy dirge"
accompanied the burial of the old man who had died. When he emerged
purified of all his crimes by the sprinkling of blood and raised to a new
"life, he was regarded as the equal of a god, and the crowd worshiped him"
from a respectful distance.[36]
The vogue obtained in the Roman empire by the practice of this repugnant
rite can only be explained by the extraordinary power ascribed to it. He
"who submitted to it was _in aeternum renatus_,[37] according to the"
inscriptions.
"We could also outline the transformation of other Phrygian ceremonies, of"
which the spirit and sometimes the letter slowly changed under the
influence of more advanced moral ideas. This is true of the sacred feasts
attended by the initiates. One of the few liturgic formulas antiquity has
"left us refers to these Phrygian banquets. One hymn says: ""I have eaten"
"from the tambourine, I have drunk from the cymbal, I have become a mystic"
"of Attis."" The banquet, which is found in several Oriental religions, was"
sometimes simply the {69} external sign indicating that the votaries of the
"same divinity formed one large family. Admitted to the sacred table, the"
neophyte was received as the guest of the community and became a brother
among brothers. The religious bond of the thiasus or _sodalicium_ took the
"place of the natural relationship of the family, the gens or the clan, just"
as the foreign religion replaced the worship of the domestic hearth.
Sometimes other effects were expected of the food eaten in common. When the
"flesh of some animal supposed to be of a divine nature was eaten, the"
votary believed that he became identified with the god and that he shared
in his substance and qualities. In the beginning the Phrygian priests
probably attributed the first of these two meanings to their barbarous
"eager spirit scorns so tardy a method: he will ""compel men to be"
"happy,"" and for this result there is but one practicable means, the"
"Social Contract, the State. Everything which mars the unity of the"
"Social Contract shall be shattered, so that the State may have a clear"
field for the exercise of its beneficent despotism. Such is
"Buonaparte's political and religious creed at the age of seventeen,"
and such it remained (with many reservations suggested by maturer
thought and self-interest) to the end of his days. It reappears in his
"policy anent the Concordat of 1802, by which religion was reduced to"
"the level of handmaid to the State, as also in his frequent assertions"
that he would never have quite the same power as the Czar and the
"Sultan, because he had not undivided sway over the consciences of his"
people.[10] In this boyish essay we may perhaps discern the
fundamental reason of his later failures. He never completely
"understood religion, or the enthusiasm which it can evoke; neither did"
"he ever fully realize the complexity of human nature, the"
"many-sidedness of social life, and the limitations that beset the"
action even of the most intelligent law-maker.[11]
His reading of Rousseau having equipped him for the study of human
"society and government, he now, during his first sojourn at Auxonne"
"(June, 1788--September, 1789), proceeds to ransack the records of the"
"ancient and modern world. Despite ill-health, family troubles, and the"
"outbreak of the French Revolution, he grapples with this portentous"
"task. The history, geography, religion, and social customs of the"
"ancient Persians, Scythians, Thracians, Athenians, Spartans,"
"Egyptians, and Carthaginians--all furnished materials for his"
encyclopædic note-books. Nothing came amiss to his summarizing genius.
Here it was that he gained that knowledge of the past which was to
astonish his contemporaries. Side by side with suggestions on
"regimental discipline and improvements in artillery, we find notes on"
"the opening episodes of Plato's ""Republic,"" and a systematic summary"
In Flemish Ghent and Bruges the clashing interests of weavers and
"woollen-traders, complicated by the strife of the French (aristocratic)"
"and anti-French (popular) factions, led to riots in which citizens and"
magistrates were killed (1301). At times these enmities reached the
magnitude of civil war. At Ypres (1303) a combination of workmen
"demanded the suppression of rival industries in neighbouring villages,"
and in an ensuing riot the mayor and all the magistrates were slain; at
Bruges (1302) a trade riot led to the loss of fifteen hundred
"lives.[744] When later the weaving trade had flourished in Brabant, the"
same fatality came about: plebeians rebelled against patrician
magistrates--themselves traders or employers of labour--in the principal
cities; and Brussels (1312) was for a time given up to pillage and
"massacre, put down only by the troops of the reigning duke. A great"
"legislative effort was made in the ""Laws of Cortenberg,"" framed by an"
"assembly of nobles and city deputies, to regulate fiscal and industrial"
affairs in a stable fashion;[745] but after fifty years the trouble
"broke out afresh, and was ill-healed.[746] At length, in a riot in the"
"rich city of Louvain (1379), sixteen of its patrician magistrates were"
"slain, whereupon many took flight to England, but many more to Haarlem,"
"Amsterdam, Leyden, and other Dutch cities.[747] Louvain never again"
recovered its trade and wealth;[748] and since the renewed
Franco-Flemish wars of this period had nearly destroyed the commerce of
"Flanders,[749] there was a general gravitation of both merchandise and"
manufacture to Holland.[750] Thus arose Dutch manufactures in an organic
"connection with maritime commerce, the Dutch municipal organisation"
securing a balance of trade interests where that of the Flemish
industrial cities had partially failed.
The commercial lead given by the Hanseatic League was followed in the
"Netherlands with a peculiar energy, and till the Spanish period the main"
part of Dutch maritime commerce was with northern Europe and the Hansa
"cities. So far as the language test goes, the original Hansards and the"
that we recognise as psychologists. Stewart tries to reinstate it by an
"appeal to 'direct observation,' an appeal which, Ferrier truly says, is"
"manifestly absurd; reasoning is useless, and we must, it would appear,"
allow any efforts we might make towards rectifying our position to be
recognised as futile.
"But now, Ferrier says, the metaphysical solution of the problem comes"
"in. We are in an _impasse_, it would appear; the analysis of the given"
fact is found impossible. But the failure of psychology opens up the
way to metaphysic. 'The turning-round of thought from psychology to
metaphysic is the true interpretation of the Platonic conversion of the
"soul from ignorance to knowledge, from mere opinion to certainty and"
"satisfaction; in other words, from a discipline in which the thinking"
"is only _apparent_, to a discipline in which the thinking is _real_.'"
"'The difference is as great between ""the science of the human mind"" and"
"metaphysic, as it is between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican"
"astronomy, and it is very much of the same kind.' It is not that"
metaphysic proposes to do _more_ than psychology; it aims at nothing
"but what it can fully overtake, and does not propose to carry a man"
"farther than his tether extends, or the surroundings in which he finds"
"himself. Metaphysic in the hands of all true astronomers of thought,"
"from Plato to Hegel, if it accomplishes more, attempts less."
"Metaphysic, Ferrier says, demands the whole given fact, and that fact"
"is summed up in this: 'We apprehend the perception of an object,' and"
"nothing short of this suffices--that is, not the perception of matter,"
"but our apprehension of that perception, or what we before called"
"knowledge, ultimate knowledge in its widest sense. And this given fact"
"is unlike the mere perception of matter, for it is capable of analysis"
and is not simply subjective and egoistic. Psychology recognises
"perception on the one hand (subjective), and matter on the other"
"(objective), but metaphysic says the distinction ought to be drawn"
Greek conception of the goddess they must be treated as complementary.
They are well interpreted by Farnell. Rejecting the theory of physical
"symbolism, he suggests ‘a more human explanation. Hera was essentially"
"the goddess of women, and the life of women was reflected in her;"
their maidenhood and marriage were solemnised by the cults of Hera
"Παρθένος and Hera Τελεία or Νυμφευομένη, and the very rare worship of"
Hera Χήρα might allude to the not infrequent custom of divorce and
"separation[1490].’ With, Hera the Widow we are not here concerned,"
but only with the higher conceptions of Zeus and Hera as expressed in
the representation of the ‘sacred marriage’; the bride and bridegroom
"who looked upon that saw in it, we may be sure, not a symbolical"
"representation of the seasons and the productive powers of the earth,"
but rather the divine prototype of human marriage. It reminded them
"that deities, like mortals, were married and given in marriage, and it"
"imparted to their wedding a sacramental character, making it at once a"
"foretaste and a gage of that close communion with the gods which, when"
death the dividing line between mortals and immortals should once be
"passed, awaited the blessed among mankind."
Other small points too suggest the same trend of thought. The
preliminaries of a wedding often comprised a sacrifice to Zeus
"Teleios and Hera Teleia[1491], and were called προτέλεια being the"
"‘preliminaries of initiation’ into that mystery, of which the"
"sacred marriage, enacted before the now wedded pair, was the full"
revelation[1492]. Again these preliminaries always included the
"solemn ablution[1493] of which I have spoken above, and in this"
resembled the preparations for admittance to the mysteries. Moreover
an instance is recorded in which this ablution was itself invested
with the significance of a wedding between the human and the divine.
The maidens of the Troad before marriage were wont to unrobe and bathe
themselves in the Scamander; and the prayer which they made to the
"river-god, whose bed they entered, was, ‘Receive thou, Scamander, my"
is one which repeats the idea which we have already seen expressed
"in the formulary of Cybele’s rites, ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν[1506], ‘I"
"was privily admitted to the bridal chamber,’ and in the token of the"
"Sabazian mysteries, ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός[1507], ‘the god pressed to"
the bosom’; and Lucian’s final phrase in his account of Alexander’s
"mock-mysteries shows a kindred phrase, τὰ ὑπὸ κόλπου[1508], as an"
euphemism of the same kind[1509]. The Orphic therefore no less than
others based his claim to future happiness on the fact that he had
"performed a ritual act, of the nature of a sacrament, which constituted"
a pledge that the wedlock between him and his goddess foreshadowed here
should be consummated hereafter.
Even more abundant evidence is furnished by sepulchral monuments;
and in support of my views I cannot do better than quote two high
authorities who coincide in their verdict upon the meaning of the
scenes represented. In reference to those scenes ‘in which death
is conceived in the guise of a marriage’ Furtwängler writes: ‘The
"monuments belonging to this class are extraordinarily numerous, and"
exhibit very different methods of treating the idea which they carry
out. A relief upon a sarcophagus from the Villa Borghese shows the God
of the dead in the act of carrying down the fair Kore to be his bride
"in the lower world. Above the steeds of his chariot, which are already"
"disappearing into the depths of the earth, flies Eros as guide. The"
bride however appears to be going only under compulsion and after some
struggle; the look of the bridegroom expresses sternness rather than
gentleness; and the mother who sits with face averted seems to exclude
all thoughts of the daughter’s return. Only in the torches which the
"guide carries in his hand, in the snakes which are looking upward, and"
"in the observant attitude of Hecate, can a suggestion of the return be"
found.
‘On another sarcophagus--from Nazzara--which represents the same
the aristocracy and were especially appreciated as litter-bearers.[8] The
"imperial and municipal administrations, as well as the big contractors to"
"whom customs and the mines were farmed out, hired or bought them in large"
"numbers, and even in the remotest border provinces the _Syrus_ was found"
"serving princes, cities or private individuals. The worship of the Syrian"
goddess profited considerably by the economic current that continually
brought new worshipers. We find her mentioned in the first century of our
"era in a Roman inscription referring in precise terms to the slave market,"
"and we know that Nero took a devout fancy to the stranger that did not,"
"however, last very long.[9] In the popular Trastevere quarter she had a"
temple until the end of paganism.[10] {107}
"During the imperial period, however, the slaves were no longer the only"
"missionaries that came from Syria, and Atargatis was no longer the only"
divinity from that country to be worshiped in the Occident. The propagation
of the Semitic worship progressed for the most part in a different manner
under the empire.
"At the beginning of our era the Syrian merchants, _Syri negotiatores_,"
undertook a veritable colonization of the Latin provinces.[11] During the
second century before Christ the traders of that nation had established
"settlements along the coast of Asia Minor, on the Piraeus, and in the"
"Archipelago. At Delos, a small island but a large commercial center, they"
"maintained several associations that worshiped their national gods, in"
particular Hadad and Atargatis. But the wars that shook the Orient at the
"end of the republic, and above all the growth of piracy, ruined maritime"
commerce and stopped emigration. This began again with renewed vigor when
the establishment of the empire guaranteed the safety of the seas and when
the Levantine traffic attained a development previously unknown. We can
trace the history of the Syrian establishments in the Latin provinces from
"the first to the seventh century, and recently we have begun to appreciate"
"their economic, social and religious importance at its true value."
"Here, for once, in connection with these “Silhouettes,” I have not, if"
"my recollection serves me, been accused of actual immorality. I am but"
"a fair way along the “primrose path,” not yet within singeing distance"
"of the “everlasting bonfire.” In other words, I have not yet written"
"“London Nights,” which, it appears (I can scarcely realize it, in my"
"innocent abstraction in aesthetical matters), has no very salutary"
"reputation among the blameless moralists of the press. I need not,"
"therefore, on this occasion, concern myself with more than the curious"
fallacy by which there is supposed to be something inherently wrong in
artistic work which deals frankly and lightly with the very real charm
of the lighter emotions and the more fleeting sensations.
I do not wish to assert that the kind of verse which happened to
"reflect certain moods of mine at a certain period of my life, is the"
"best kind of verse in itself, or is likely to seem to me, in other"
"years, when other moods may have made me their own, the best kind of"
verse for my own expression of myself. Nor do I affect to doubt that
the creation of the supreme emotion is a higher form of art than the
"reflection of the most exquisite sensation, the evocation of the most"
magical impression. I claim only an equal liberty for the rendering of
every mood of that variable and inexplicable and contradictory creature
"which we call ourselves, of every aspect under which we are gifted or"
condemned to apprehend the beauty and strangeness and curiosity of the
visible world.
"Patchouli! Well, why not Patchouli? Is there any “reason in nature” why"
"we should write exclusively about the natural blush, if the delicately"
"acquired blush of rouge has any attraction for us? Both exist; both, I"
"think, are charming in their way; and the latter, as a subject, has, at"
"all events, more novelty. If you prefer your “new-mown hay” in the"
"hayfield, and I, it may be, in a scent-bottle, why may not my"
excision of a rib for draining a hæmothorax. These operations in the
early part of the campaign were more freely undertaken on the
supposition that rise of temperature and other symptoms of fever pointed
to incipient breaking down of the clot. Subsequent experience showed
"this not to be the case, and early operations for drainage ceased to be"
undertaken. In these operations a primary difficulty was met with in
"effectively clearing out the clot, a drain had to be left, and"
suppuration occurred later in a considerable proportion. The
"suppurations were most troublesome; local adhesions formed, and the pus"
"collected in small pockets, which were difficult to find and to drain,"
and even when the collections seemed to have been successfully dealt
"with at the time, residual abscesses often followed at a very late date."
"Thus, I saw a case with a contracted chest and a fresh abscess the day"
"before I left Cape Town, in whom I had advised and witnessed an"
operation for the evacuation of clot in the presence of signs of fever a
"week after my arrival in the country, nine months previously. I saw"
"another case where general infection followed incision of a hæmothorax,"
but the patient fortunately recovered.
The question of _pleurisy_ has already been mentioned in connection with
"hæmothorax; it no doubt accounted for secondary effusion in some cases,"
and beyond this I have nothing to add to what has been there said.
"_Pneumonia_ was rare; there were occasionally signs of consolidation,"
"but, I think, quite as often in the opposite lung as in the one injured."
"I never saw a fatal case, and I am inclined to think that when it"
occurred it was as often the result of cold and exposure as of the
"injury to the lung. Abscess of the lung I only saw once, and that in a"
case in which the injury to the chest was complicated by paraplegia from
"spinal injury and septicæmia, and it was possibly pyæmic."
_Diagnosis._--No difficulties special to small-calibre wounds were
"printed on top of the other three colors, usually in black or dark gray."
It is of particular importance that the engraver who is to make the
halftone plates should be informed as to the kind of paper they are to
"be printed on. A 50-line halftone plate will print on almost anything,"
"but is too coarse to render the details of the picture, and is usually"
applied only for newspaper use. It would be entirely too coarse for the
"purpose of book illustration. On the other hand, a halftone plate made"
through a screen of 400 lines to the inch can be printed satisfactorily
"only upon paper of the highest surface, and with correspondingly"
"careful presswork. For super-calendered or English-finish paper, plates"
"made through a 133-line screen are most advisable, while the average"
coated or enameled paper will take 150-line halftones to best advantage.
"Lineplates are etchings in relief on plates of zinc or copper,"
"reproduced from pen-and-ink-drawings, or diagrams, by photo-mechanical"
"process. The method in general is the same as that for halftone work,"
"but without the intervention of the screen. In lineplates, the light"
"and shade effects are produced by gradations of thick and thin lines,"
"in distinction from the effects of wash-drawings and photographs, which"
are produced by gradations of tone. The latter require the intervention
of the screen to convert the full tone gradations into the halftone
"of the dots and stipples, while the former may, as already noted, be"
reproduced directly.
"Other classes of engravings, of a more costly kind, and which are"
"therefore used only in books of more expensive character, are the"
"various forms of engraving in intaglio; that is to say, in effects"
produced by cutting or etching the design into and below the surface
"of the plate, instead of cutting or etching away the ground, and"
leaving the design in relief. Examples of this order are the old-time
"copperplate engraving, the more modern steel-engraving,[41] in the"
"four-and-a-half millions of Dutch are Catholics; while in Belgium, where"
"there are hardly any Protestants, the Flemish-speaking and"
French-speaking populations are nearly equal in numbers.
"Van Kampen, who anticipated Motley in disparaging the Walloons as being"
"Frenchly fickle (_Geschichte_, i, 366), proceeds to contend that even"
the Flemings are more excitable than the Dutch and other Teutons; but he
notes later that as the Dutch poet Cats was much read and imitated in
"Belgium, he was thus proved to have expressed the spirit of the whole"
"Netherlands (ii, 109). Once more, then, the racial theory collapses.]"
"Thus the systematic savagery of the Inquisition under Philip, for which"
"the people at first blamed not at all the king but his Flemish minister,"
"Cardinal Granvelle, served rather to make a basis and pretext for"
organised revolt than directly to kindle it. In so far as the people
"spontaneously resorted to violence, in the image-breaking riots, they"
compromised and imperilled the nationalist movement in the act of
"precipitating it. The king's personal equation, finally, served to make"
"an enemy of the masterly William of Orange, who, financially embarrassed"
"like the lesser nobility,[777] could have been retained as an"
administrator by a wise monarch. A matter so overlaid with historical
declamation is hard to set in a clear light; but it may serve to say of
"William that he was made a ""patriot,"" as was Robert the Bruce, by stress"
of circumstances;[778] and that in the one case as in the other it was
exceptional character and capacity that made patriotism a success;[779]
William in particular having to maintain himself against continual
"domestic enmity, patrician as well as popular. Nothing short of the"
"ferocity and rapacity of the Spanish attack, indeed, could have long"
united the Netherlands. The first confederacy dissolved at the approach
"of Alva, who, strong in soldiership but incapable of a statesmanlike"
"settlement, drove the Dutch provinces to extremities by his cruelty,"
caused a hundred thousand artisans and traders to fly with their
speedily depressed by their evaporation; endowed with enough of
learning and culture to be a Voltairean and write second-rate
verses; and with a talent for intrigue which sufficed to embarrass
his never very affluent fortunes. Napoleon certainly derived no
world-compelling qualities from his father: for these he was indebted
to the wilder strain which ran in his mother's blood. The father
doubtless saw in the French connection a chance of worldly advancement
and of liberation from pecuniary difficulties; for the new rulers now
sought to gain over the patrician families of the island. Many of them
had resented the dictatorship of Paoli; and they now gladly accepted
"the connection with France, which promised to enrich their country and"
"to open up a brilliant career in the French army, where commissions"
were limited to the scions of nobility.
"Much may be said in excuse of Charles Buonaparte's decision, and no"
one can deny that Corsica has ultimately gained much by her connection
with France. But his change of front was open to the charge that it
was prompted by self-interest rather than by philosophic foresight. At
"any rate, his second son throughout his boyhood nursed a deep"
resentment against his father for his desertion of the patriots'
"cause. The youth's sympathies were with the peasants, whose allegiance"
"was not to be bought by baubles, whose constancy and bravery long held"
out against the French in a hopeless guerilla warfare. His hot
Corsican blood boiled at the stories of oppression and insult which he
"heard from his humbler compatriots. When, at eleven years of age, he"
"saw in the military college at Brienne the portrait of Choiseul, the"
"French Minister who had urged on the conquest of Corsica, his passion"
"burst forth in a torrent of imprecations against the traitor; and,"
"even after the death of his father in 1785, he exclaimed that he could"
never forgive him for not following Paoli into exile.
"What trifles seem, at times, to alter the current of human affairs!"
would make the children in later life immune from those appeals to
idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of
scoundrels.
History should be taught in the same way. Napoleon’s campaigns of 1813
"and 1814, for instance, might be studied in the _Moniteur_, leading up"
to the surprise which Parisians felt when they saw the Allies arriving
under the walls of Paris after they had (according to the official
bulletins) been beaten by Napoleon in every battle. In the more advanced

"Lenin has been assassinated by Trotsky, in order to learn contempt for"
"death. Finally, they should be given a school history approved by the"
"Government, and asked to infer what a French school history would say"
about our wars with France. All this would be a far better training in
citizenship than the trite moral maxims by which some people believe
that civic duty can be inculcated.
"It must, I think, be admitted that the evils of the world are due to"
moral defects quite as much as to lack of intelligence. But the human
race has not hitherto discovered any method of eradicating moral
defects; preaching and exhortation only add hypocrisy to the previous
"list of vices. Intelligence, on the contrary, is easily improved by"
"methods known to every competent educator. Therefore, until some method"
"of teaching virtue has been discovered, progress will have to be sought"
by improvement of intelligence rather than of morals. One of the chief
"obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be"
enormously diminished by instruction as to the prevalent forms of
mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever
"was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier"
"than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy,"
the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to
the holders of power. Hence the increase in the circulation of
"Mission preacher will use his magnetic power, the artist whose skill"
"it is to build or to paint, will make his appeal to the love of order"
"and beauty, the musicians will meet the heart through the ear. May not"
the writer of fiction use his psychological training and his knowledge
of many sides of human life to create a story which shall set men
thinking about the old doctrines which he believes to have lost none
of their regenerating power?
There is danger lest men with good intentions should go blindly to
work to redress and diminish social grievances. Individualism with its
"hateful cry, “Each man for himself and the devil take the hindmost,”"
"is now at a discount, but it may be replaced by a despotism of State"
"regulation which will destroy the family and the home. There is, I"
"believe, only one creed which can make the capitalist unselfish and"
"the sons of labour satisfied, which will tell men that wealth means"
"responsibility and that there is dignity in toil, which will teach the"
rich man to order himself lowly and reverently to those who are _his_
"betters and to hurt nobody by word or deed, which will teach the"
"labourer that his chief need is not other men’s wealth, but the"
“carrière ouverte aux talents” and the determination to do his duty in
"that state of life, whatever it may be, unto which God _shall_ call"
him.
It is the Holy Catholic Faith which makes equality of opportunity for
"all men its earthly ambition, and offers refreshment and hope to those"
who are not strong enough to strive with the rest. The old men saw
"visions and we have found that they were prophecies, a young man may"
dream dreams. My dream is that the men who are doing the work of the
world to-day may be taught that Christ is their best teacher and the
Incarnate God their refuge and strength.
There is a tale of an acrobat and juggler who knew well that his
"personal motives rather than religious zeal.""[691] ""The glebes and"
"hospital lands were a fresh power in the hands of the crown, and the"
subservient Lutheran clergy became the most powerful class in the
island; while the bad system of underleasing at rack-rent and short
lease with unsecured tenant-right extended in this way over at least a
"quarter of the better land, stopping any possible progress."" For the"
"rest, ""the Reformation had produced a real poet [Hallgrim Petersen], but"
"the material rise of Iceland""--that is, the recent improvements in the"
"condition of the people--""has not yet done so,""[692] though poetry is"
still cultivated in Iceland very much as music is elsewhere.
Thus this one little community may be said to have reached the limits of
"its evolution, as compared with others, simply because of the strait"
natural conditions in which its lot was cast. But to think of it as a
tragically moribund organism is merely to proceed upon the old
hallucinations of race-consciousness. Men reared in Iceland have done
"their part in making European civilisation, entering the more southerly"
Scandinavian stocks as these entered the stocks of western Europe; and
"the present population, who are a remnant, have no more cause to hang"
their heads than any family that happens to have few members or to have
missed wealth. Failure is relative only to pretension or purpose.
"The modern revival of Scandinavian culture, as must needs be, is the"
outcome of all the European influences. At the close of the sixteenth
"century, in more or less friendly intercourse with the other Protestant"
"countries of north Europe, Denmark began effectively to develop a"
"literature such as theirs, imaginative and scientific, in the vernacular"
as well as in Latin; and so the development went on while Sweden was
gaining military glory with little enlightenment. Then a rash attack
upon Sweden ended in a loss of some of the richest Danish provinces

means of a dramatic story we can counteract some of the sights and
sounds of the streets which appeal to the melodramatic instinct in
children. I am sure that all teachers whose work lies in the crowded
cities must have realised the effect produced on children by what they
see and hear on their way to and from school. If we merely consider
"the hoardings, with their realistic representations, quite apart from"
"the actual dramatic happenings in the street, we at once perceive"
that the ordinary school interests pale before such lurid appeals as
these. How can we expect the child who has stood open-mouthed before
"a poster representing a woman chloroformed by a burglar, whilst that"
"hero escapes in safety with her jewels, to display any interest in the"
arid monotony of the multiplication-table? The illegitimate excitement
created by the sight of the depraved burglar can only be counteracted
by something equally exciting along the realistic but legitimate side;
"and this is where the story of the right kind becomes so valuable, and"
why the teacher who is artistic enough to undertake the task can find
the short path to results which theorists seek for so long in vain. It
is not even necessary to have an exceedingly exciting story; sometimes
one which will bring about pure reaction may be just as suitable.
I remember in my personal experience an instance of this kind. I had
been reading with some children of about ten years old the story from
"Cymbeline, of Imogen in the forest scene, when the brothers strew"
"flowers upon her, and sing the funeral dirge,"
“Fear no more the heat of the sun.”
"Just as we had all taken on this tender, gentle mood, the door opened"
and one of the prefects announced in a loud voice the news of the
"relief of Mafeking. The children were on their feet at once, cheering"
"lustily, and for the moment the joy over the relief of the brave"
"garrison was the predominant feeling. Then, before the Jingo spirit"
car likewise becomes a triumphal car.
‘Just as the marriage of Zeus in the realm of light became a type for
"men in this life, so the marriage of Hades, or of Dionysus representing"
"him, developed into a similar prototype for the dead. Since that which"
"is true of Death bears directly upon the actual dead, it was quite"
natural that gradually the process of death came to be considered in
general as a wedding with the deities of death. With this conception
too harmonize those wedding-scenes which are so common and conspicuous
"on funeral monuments, as well as the often-recurring scenes from the"
joyous cycle of Dionysus-myths[1510].’
"Two brief comments may be made upon this passage. First, Furtwängler"
"clearly recognises in Dionysus a mere substitute for Hades, and thus"
confirms my interpretation of the strange legend concerning Dionysus
and Prosymnus[1511]. We noticed that the somewhat obscure observation
of Heraclitus (as quoted by Clement) upon that story contained the
words ‘Dionysus and Hades are one and the same’; and we now see that
"in art too the same identification was made, and that the marriage of"
a mortal with Dionysus was used to typify the future marriage of the
dead with their gods. The reason for this identification seems simply
"to be that the cults in which the two gods figured, although differing"
"in outward form, were felt to express one and the same idea--namely the"
conception of death as a form of marriage; and the tendency to identify
"in such cases was carried so far that the god Dionysus was even, we are"
"told, identified with the mortal Adonis[1512], presumably because the"
"worship of each, as I have shown above, turned upon this one cardinal"
doctrine.
"Secondly, Furtwängler points out that the marriage of Zeus and Hera"
represented for living men the same doctrine as the marriage of Hades
and Persephone (or of Dionysus and Ariadne) represented for the dead.
The truth of this is well illustrated by the close resemblance between
"industry and capital, exasperated even the Catholic ministers in"
"Flanders by his proposed taxes, and finally by imposing them enraged"
"into fresh revolt the people he had crushed and terrorised, till they"
were eager to offer the sovereignty to the queen of England. When
"Requesens came with pacificatory intentions, it was too late; and the"
Pacification of Ghent (1576) was but a breathing-space between grapples.
What finally determined the separation and independence of the Dutch
"Provinces was their maritime strength. Antwerp, trading largely on"
"foreign bottoms, represented wealth without the then indispensable"
weapons. Dutch success begins significantly with the taking of Brill
"(1572) by the gang of William van der Marck, mostly pirates and"
"ruffians, whose methods William of Orange could not endure.[780] But"
they had shown the military basis for the maritime States. It was the
"Dutch fleet that prevented Parma's from joining ""the"" Armada under"
"Medina-Sidonia,[781] thereby perhaps saving England. Such military"
genius and energy as Parma's might have made things go hard with the
"Dutch States had he lived, or had he not been called off against his"
judgment to fight in France; but his death well balanced the
"assassination of William of Orange, who had thus far been the great"
sustainer and welder of the movement of independence. Plotted against
"and vilified by the demagogues of Ghent, betrayed by worthless fellow"
"nobles, Teutonic and French alike; chronically insulted in his own"
"person and humiliated in that of his brother John, whom the States"
treated with unexampled meanness; stupidly resisted in his own
"leadership by the same States, whose egoism left Maestricht to its fate"
"when he bade them help, and who cast on him the blame when it fell;"
thwarted and crippled by the fanaticism and intolerant violence of the
Protestant mobs of the towns; bereaved again and again in the
"vicissitude of the struggle, William turned to irrelevance all"
imputations of self-seeking; and in his unfailing sagacity and fortitude
he finally matches any aristocrat statesman in history. Doubtless he
From ocean to ocean the territory which is called the Canal Zone is
"about forty-three miles long, ten miles wide and contains about 436"
"square miles, about ninety-five of which are under the waters of the"
"Canal, and Miraflores and Gatun Lakes. It is bounded on the north by the"
"Caribbean Sea, on the south by the Pacific Ocean, and on the east and"
west by the Republic of Panama. It traverses the narrowest part of
"Panama, the waist so to speak, and has been taken out of that body"
politic by the diplomatic surgeons as neatly as though it had been an
obnoxious vermiform appendix. Its territory does not terminate at low
"water-mark, but extends three marine miles out to sea, and, as I write,"
a question of jurisdiction has arisen between the two Republics--hardly
twin Republics--of Panama and the United States concerning jurisdiction
over three malefactors captured by the Zone police in a motor boat out
at sea. It may be noted in passing that Panama is properly tenacious of
"its rights and dignity, and that cases of conflicting jurisdiction are"
continually arising when any offender has only to foot it a mile or two
to be out of the territory in which his offense was committed. The
police officials of the Zone affect to think that the Panama authorities
are inclined to deal lightly with native offenders who commit robbery or
murder on the Zone and then stroll across the line to be arrested in
their native State.
[Illustration: A SQUAD OF CANAL ZONE POLICE OFFICERS]
There was a quarrel on while I was on the Zone over the custody of a
"Panamanian who killed his wife, with attendant circumstances of"
"peculiar brutality, and then balked the vengeance of the Zone criminal"
authorities by getting himself arrested in Panama. “We want to show
"these fellows”, remarked a high police official of the Zone, “that if"
they do murder in our territory we are going to do the hanging”. That

"Evidently, then, the characteristics of his family claim some"
attention from all who would understand the man and the influence
which he was to wield over modern Europe.
It has been the fortune of his House to be the subject of dispute from
first to last. Some writers have endeavoured to trace its descent back
"to the Cæsars of Rome, others to the Byzantine Emperors; one"
"genealogical explorer has tracked the family to Majorca, and, altering"
"its name to Bonpart, has discovered its progenitor in the Man of the"
"Iron Mask; while the Duchesse d'Abrantès, voyaging eastwards in quest"
"of its ancestors, has confidently claimed for the family a Greek"
origin. Painstaking research has dispelled these romancings of
"historical _trouveurs_, and has connected this enigmatic stock with a"
"Florentine named ""William, who in the year 1261 took the surname of"
"_Bonaparte_ or _Buonaparte_. The name seems to have been assumed when,"
amidst the unceasing strifes between Guelfs and Ghibellines that rent
"the civic life of Florence, William's party, the Ghibellines, for a"
brief space gained the ascendancy. But perpetuity was not to be found
in Florentine politics; and in a short time he was a fugitive at a
"Tuscan village, Sarzana, beyond the reach of the victorious Guelfs."
"Here the family seems to have lived for well nigh three centuries,"
maintaining its Ghibelline and aristocratic principles with surprising
"tenacity. The age was not remarkable for the virtue of constancy, or"
any other virtue. Politics and private life were alike demoralized by
"unceasing intrigues; and amidst strifes of Pope and Emperor, duchies"
"and republics, cities and autocrats, there was formed that type of"
Italian character which is delineated in the pages of Macchiavelli.
From the depths of debasement of that cynical age the Buonapartes
"were saved by their poverty, and by the isolation of their life at"
Sarzana. Yet the embassies discharged at intervals by the more
talented members of the family showed that the gifts for intrigue were
"Villiers flashed back an amused, responsive glance, and then"
conscientiously strove to pay more attention to the irrepressible

"there came one of those extraordinary, sudden rushes of gabble that"
"often occur at even the stiffest dinner-party,--a galloping race of"
"tongues, in which nothing really distinct is heard, but in which each"
talks to the other as though moved by an impulse of sheer desperation.
This burst of noise was a relief after the strained murmurs of trite
"commonplaces that had hitherto been the order of the hour, and the fair"
"Duchess, somewhat easier in her mind, turned anew to Alwyn, with"
greater grace and gentleness of manner than she had yet shown.

"after your travels abroad? In England we ARE dull,--our tristesse"
"cannot be denied. But, really, the climate is responsible,--we want"
"more sunshine. I suppose in the East, where the sun is so warm and"
"bright, the people are always cheerful?"""
"""On the contrary, I have found them rather serious and contemplative"
"than otherwise,"" returned Alwyn,--""yet their gravity is certainly of a"
"pleasant, and not of a forbidding type. I don't myself think the sun"
"has much to do with the disposition of man, after all,--I fancy his"
"temperament is chiefly moulded by the life he leads. In the East, for"
"instance, men accept their existence as a sort of divine command, which"
"they obey cheerfully, yet with a consciousness of high"
"responsibility:--on the Continent they take it as a bagatelle, lightly"
"won, lightly lost, hence their indifferent, almost childish,"

"fury. Outside, the languorous ocean heaved as smiling and serene as"
"ever, but within the harbor a wondrous change occurred."
"As if in answer to some deep-sea signal, the tides were quickened by a"
"coursing multitude, steadfast and unafraid, yet foredoomed to die by"
"the hand of man, or else more surely by the serving of their destiny."
"Clad in their argent mail of blue and green, they worked the bay to"
"madness; they overwhelmed the waters, surging forward in great droves"
"and columns, hesitating only long enough to frolic with the shifting"
"currents, as if rejoicing in their strength and beauty."
At times they swam with cleaving fins exposed: again they churned the
placid waters until swift combers raced across the shallow bars like
tidal waves while the deeper channels were shot through with shadowy
forms or pierced by the lightning glint of silvered bellies. They
"streamed in with the flood tide to retreat again with the ebb, but"
there was neither haste nor caution in their progress; they had come in
"answer to the breeding call of the sea, and its exultation was upon"
"them, driving them relentlessly onward. They had no voice against its"
overmastering spell.
"Mustering in the early light like a swarm of giant white-winged moths,"

ploughing back again deep laden with their spoils. Grimy tugboats lay
"beside the traps, shrilling the air with creaking winches as they"

"for exploiting applications of knowledge, not so often for saving as"
"for destruction. In the absence of some power of restraint, civilisation"
is trembling in an unstable poise on the brink of ruin. Some
complementary ideal there must be to save man from that mad rush which
must end in disaster. He has followed the lure and excitement of some
"insatiable ambition, never pausing for a moment to think of the ultimate"
object for which success was to serve as a temporary incentive. He
forgot that far more potent than competition was mutual help and
co-operation in the scheme of life. And in this country through
"milleniums, there always have been some who, beyond the immediate and"
"absorbing prize of the hour, sought for the realisation of the highest"
"ideal of life--not through passive renunciation, but through active"
"struggle. The weakling who has refused the conflict, having acquired"
"nothing has nothing to renounce. He alone who has striven and won, can"
enrich the world by giving away the fruits of his victorious experience.
In India such examples of constant realisation of ideals through work
have resulted in the formation of a continuous living tradition. And by
her latent power of rejuvenescence she has readjusted herself through
infinite transformations. Thus while the soul of Babylon and the Nile
"Valley have transmigrated, ours still remains vital and with capacity of"
"absorbing what time has brought, and making it one with itself."
"The ideal of giving, of enriching, in fine, of self-renunciation in"
response to the highest call of humanity is the other and complementary
ideal. The motive power for this is not to be found in personal ambition
"but in the effacement of all littlenesses, and uprooting of that"
ignorance which regards anything as gain which is to be purchased at
"others' loss. This I know, that no vision of truth can come except in"

the point of rest.

"The most interesting feature was offered by the temperature, as this was"
very liable to lead one astray. A primary rise always occurred with the
"collection of blood in the pleura, this reaching its height on the third"
"or fourth day, usually about 102° F. in well-marked cases; it then fell,"
"and in favourable instances remained normal. In a large number of cases,"
"however, where the amount of blood was considerable, this was not the"
"case, the primary fall not reaching the normal, and a second rise"
occurred which reached the same height as before or higher. The second
"rise was accompanied by sweating, quickened pulse, and the probability"
of the development of an empyema had always to be considered. I believe
in most cases this secondary rise was an indication of a further
"increase in the hæmorrhage, for the dulness usually increased in extent,"
and such rises were often seen when the patient had been moved or taken
"a journey. Again, the temperature often fell to normal after"
"paracentesis and removal of the blood, to rise again with a fresh"
"accumulation, which was not uncommon. I have already mentioned the large"
proportional incidence of hæmothorax observed in the patients who had
"to travel down from Paardeberg, and I might instance another case"
"related to me by Dr. Flockemann of the German ambulance, which was very"
"striking. A Boer, wounded at Colesberg, developed a hæmothorax which"
"quieted down, and he was removed to Bloemfontein; on arrival at the"
"latter place the temperature rose, and other signs of fever suggested"
"the development of an empyema; an exploring needle, however, only"
brought blood to light. After a short stay at Bloemfontein the symptoms
"entirely subsided, and the man was sent to Kroonstadt, when an exactly"
"similar attack resulted, again quieting down with rest."
"Similar recurrent attacks of hæmorrhage and fever occurred, however, in"
patients confined to their beds without moving after the first journey.

"In the case of Astrology,--a relatively more advanced method of"
"divination,--the underlying theory rested on the supposed complete"
correspondence between movements and phenomena in the heavens and
"occurrences on earth. The gods, being identified with the heavenly"
"bodies,--with the moon, sun, planets, and fixed stars--or as we might also"
"put it, the heavenly bodies being personified as gods, the movements in"
the heavens were interpreted as representing the activity of the gods
"preparing the events on earth. Therefore, he who could read the signs in"
the heavens aright would know what was to happen here below. Astrology
corresponded in a measure to the modern Weather Bureau in that it enabled
"one to ascertain a little in advance what was certain to happen,"
"sufficiently so in order to be prepared for it. Compared with Hepatoscopy,"
Astrology not only represents a form of divination that might be
designated as semi-scientific--only relatively scientific of course--but
"also occupies a higher plane, because there was no attempt involved to"
induce a deity unfavorably disposed to change his mind. The signs were
there; they pointed unmistakably to certain occurrences on earth that were
certain to occur and it was the task of the diviner--the =bârû= or
'inspector' as the Babylonian called him--to indicate whether what the
gods were preparing would be beneficial or harmful. Both Hepatoscopy and
Astrology as developed by the Babylonians and Assyrians =bârû=-priests
"exerted a wide influence, the former spreading to the Hittites and"
"Etruscans and through the one or the other medium to Greeks and Romans[6],"
while Babylonian-Assyrian Astrology passing to the Greeks became the basis
"for Graeco-Roman and mediaeval Astrology, profoundly influencing the"
religious thought of Europe[7] and in a modified form surviving even to
our own days. The chain of evidence has recently been completed[8] to
prove the direct transfer of the cuneiform astrological literature to
Greek astrologers and astronomers. The possibility also of a spread or at
least of a secondary influence of both systems to the distant East is also
"of this combination, and any slight thoracic disturbance even in healthy"
"persons, arising from heart or stomach, and acting on the respiration,"
serves to bring these conditions to sleeping consciousness and to
determine the dream of flying.
"Dreams of flying are sometimes associated with dreams of falling, the"
falling sensation occurring either at the beginning or at the end of
the dream; such a dream may be said to be of the Icarus type.[116]
"Jewell considers that the two kinds of dream have the same causation,"
the difference being merely a difference of apperception. The frequent
connection between the two dreams indicates that the causation is
"allied, but it scarcely seems to be identical. If it were identical,"
we should scarcely find that while the emotional tone of the dream of
"flying is usually agreeable, that of the dream of falling is usually"
disagreeable.[117]
I have no personal experience of the sensation of falling in normal
"dreaming, although Jewell and Hutchinson have found that it is more"
"common than flying, the latter regarding it, indeed, as the most common"
"kind of dream, the dream of flying coming next in frequency. A friend"
"who has no dreams of flying, but has experienced dreams of falling"
"from his earliest years, tells me that they are always associated with"
"feelings of terror. This suggests an organic cause, and the fact that the"
"sensation of falling may occur in epileptic fits during sleep,[118] seems"
further to suggest the presence of circulatory and nervous disturbance.
It would seem probable that while the same two factors--respiratory and
"tactile--are operative in both types of dream, they are not of equal"
"force in each. In the dream of flying, respiratory activity is excited,"
and in response to excitation it works at a high level adequate to the
needs of the organism. In the dream of falling it may be that respiratory
"activity is depressed, while concomitantly, perhaps, the anaesthetic state"
of the skin is increased. In the first state the abnormal activity of
"_Par excellence_, it was, in the phrase of Louis XIV, the nation of"
"shopkeepers, of middlemen; and its long supremacy in the business of"
buying cheap and selling dear was due firstly to economy of means and
"consumption, and secondarily to command of accumulated money capital at"
low rates of interest. The sinking of interest was the first sign that
the limits to its commercial expansion were being reached; but it
"belonged to the conditions that, with or without ""empire,"" its advantage"
must begin to fall away as soon as rival States were able to compete
"with it in the economies of ""production"" in the sense of transport and"
transfer.
In such economies the Dutch superiority grew out of the specially
practical basis of their marine--habitual fishing and the constant use
of canals. There is no better way than the former of building up
seamanship; and just as the Portuguese grew from hardy fishers to daring
"navigators, so the Dutch grew from thrifty fishers and bargemen to"
"thrifty handlers of sea-freight, surpassing in economy the shippers of"
"England as they did in seamanship the marine of Spain. Broadly speaking,"
"the navies which owed most to royal fostering--as those of Spain,"
"France, and in part England--were the later to reach efficiency in the"
degree of their artificiality; and the loss of one great Spanish navy
after another in storms must be held to imply a lack of due experience
on the part of their officers.
One of the worst military mistakes of Spain was the creation of
great galleons in preference to small cruisers. The sight of the
"big ships terrorised the Dutch once, in 1606; but as all existing"
"seacraft had been built up in small vessels, there was no"
sufficient science for the navigation of the great ones in stress
"of weather, or even for the building of them on sound lines. The"
"English and Dutch, on the other hand, fought in vessels of the kind"
"they had always been wont to handle, increasing their size only by"
"strengthening the memory, whilst the stories of “Jehu and those other"
Johnnies you know” were by no means devoid of picturesque incident.
Greek Testament could also be made useful in the acquisition of a
"vocabulary, or in a lesson showing the difference between classical"
and vernacular Greek. “Of course we must leave the application of
"these studies to conduct to _Home influence_,” the headmasters would"
"blandly observe, and between parent and pedagogue the teaching of the"
Christian Faith fell neglected to the ground.
"What chance had the boys so brought up, of forming any conception of"
the essential truths of Religion? A superficial acquaintance with the
"stories of Hebrew history, a perfunctory attendance at chapel, some"
"well-meant exhortations on the subject of temperance and chastity, as"
the catechism was revived in their memories before they were brought
"to be confirmed by the Bishop, and some ability “to translate and give"
"the context” of a few phrases from the Greek texts of the Gospels,"
these were their intellectual religious equipment for a life of fierce
temptation from within and without. And when they encountered the
storm and stress of modern social life they found that the critics had
"taken from them the old reverence of nursery days for “God’s Book,”"
"their school training had taught them only a rough code of honour, and"
their chief restraint from any ignoble impulse was a feeling that to
do certain deeds was not “good form.”
A little lower down the social ladder the man in the street has fared
no better in his boyhood. In the public elementary schools he has had
"a half-hour’s lesson in Scripture and catechism five days of the week,"
"and annually the Diocesan, or the School Board, Inspector came round"
to ascertain whether the Syllabus of religious teaching had been duly
followed. But only when devout parish priests had a talent for
teaching and a love for boys and girls was any attempt made to give
"children a _religion_, and even in this case not very much could be"
"public bond in peace, over and above the normal tie of common enmities."
The result was a development of civic life still more rapid and more
"marked in inland Flanders,[735] where the territorial feudal power was"
naturally greater than in the maritime Dutch provinces. Self-ruling
"cities, such as Ghent and Antwerp, at their meridian, were too powerful"
to be effectively menaced by their immediate feudal lords. But on the
side of their relations with neighbouring cities or States they all
exhibited the normal foible; and it was owing only to the murderous
compulsion put upon them by Spain in the sixteenth century that any of
the provinces of the Netherlands became a federal republic. For five
"centuries after Charlemagne, who subdued them to his system, the Low"
Countries had undergone the ordinary slow evolution from pure feudalism
to the polity of municipalities. In the richer inland districts the
"feudal system, lay and clerical, was at its height, the baronial castles"
"being ""here more numerous than in any other part of Christendom"";[736]"
"and when the growing cities began to feel their power to buy charters,"
"the feudal formula was unchallenged,[737] while the mass of the outside"
"population were in the usual ""Teutonic"" state of partial or complete"
serfdom. It was only by burning their suburbs and taking to the walled
fortress that the people of Utrecht escaped the yoke of the
Norsemen.[738]
"Mr. Torrens M'Cullagh is responsible for the statement that ""it"
seems doubtful whether any portion of the inhabitants of Holland
"were ever in a state of actual servitude or bondage,"" and that the"
northern provinces were more generally free from slavery than the
"others (_Industrial History of the Free Nations_, 1846, ii, 39)."
"Motley (_Rise of the Dutch Republic_, as cited, pp. 17, 18)"
"pronounces, on the contrary, that ""in the northern Netherlands the"
"degraded condition of the mass continued longest,"" and that ""the"
number of slaves throughout the Netherlands was very large; the
"number belonging to the bishopric of Utrecht enormous."" This is"
"blood in the pleura, convalescence was more prolonged, and an average"
time of six to eight weeks often elapsed before the patients could be
safely discharged from hospital. In the more serious a certain amount of
"dulness always persisted at this time over the base of the lung, and the"
"chest was usually somewhat contracted on the injured side, with evidence"
in the way of decreased vesicular murmur that the lung was still not
free from compression. With regard to the persistence of dulness on
"percussion, it is well to bear in mind that a thin layer of blood"
apparently produces as serious impairment of resonance as a much larger
quantity of serum. The signs appeared to favour the view that the space
necessary for the location of the hæmorrhage had been obtained at the
"expense of the lung rather than by distension of the thoracic parietes,"
"and also, I think, denoted the presence of adhesions. Possibly they will"
entirely disappear with the return of full excursion movements of
"respiration, the latter being often still somewhat restricted when the"
patients left hospital. All the patients with such signs were liable to
attacks of pain and shortness of breath on actual bodily exertion. I
"happened to meet with an officer, the subject of a Lee-Metford wound of"
"the thorax, sustained five years previously, and he told me that he was"
nine months before he could take active exercise without feeling short
of breath.
"As to the cases of hæmothorax and empyema which needed drainage, all did"
well; but expansion of the lung was much less satisfactory than would
"have been expected, probably on account of especially firm adhesions."
The importance of concurrent injury I need hardly dwell on; but I might
"add that perforation of one or both arms, the most common one, did not"
materially affect the general statements above made.
_Treatment._--In the early stages of the pulmonary wounds rest was the
"all-important indication, and when this was assured few serious cases of"
"hæmothorax occurred. Beyond simple rest, the administration of opium"

realm of his manhood!
The young fellow had been too restless to stay in the dingy mute rooms
of the hotel; he could think it out better in the open--striding to his
thinking. It was in the blood--he smiled at the restless walk of Lord
"Wyntwarde up and down that library, of the strange trick that came out"
in his mother at times....
"Ah, London, thou queen of cities, that filchest for ever the hearts of"
"them that dare to love thee! Radiant in thy sunshine, fantastic in thy"
"murk, it is when thou puttest on the habit of thy lilac twilight that"
"thou showest all thy majesty--thy tiring maids, the handsomest women"
"of the world, helping thee to thy wondrous mantle of many hues--pale"
"whitenesses and opal greys, beribboned with purple and ultramarine and"
"the sooty tinge of dusky shadows, adorned with diamonds of a hundred"
"flames and wrought through and through with gold and silvery strands,"
"and thus and so, with smoky art, spinning thyself a mystic robe that it"
is full fit only the Queen of all cities shall wear.
"And what a splendid stage, thy realm, to strut it in! Thy large drama"
"knows no curtain, thy magnificence no boundary but man’s narrow sight."
"Thy whisper and the song of thee, and thy strange melodies, no strings"
of violins nor the resounding hollows of deep orchestral ’cellos
"can yield. From the music of thy ways, where goes thy multitudinous"
"traffic with roll of many wheels, and lurches the gaudy omnibus with"
"reeking horses twain, and lumbers the thundering dray, and winds in"
and out the teeming welter the quick black hansom seeking the hackney
"fare, with jigging of horse-bells that sound a catchy measure to the"
"shuffle of many feet, from out thy swarming hive there comes the breath"
of vigorous life and thinkingness and the atmosphere of quick wits
and alert wills that have the habit of decisive action and of dogged
"was contained in germ in those early polemics, vaguely and mythically"
"in Bruno, and much more consciously in Vico, is substantially that of"
Croce's identification of philosophy with history.
"We do not expect of a new philosophy that it should suddenly, as a"
"revelation or illumination, give us a key to all the problems of"
"reality, and resolve, once and forever, the so-called mystery of the"
"universe. If such a thing should ever happen, it would mean the end of"
"life, which cannot be conceived, in its ultimate essence, otherwise"
than as a perpetual positing and solution of problems. It must not be
"forgotten that a philosophy is the work of one man, and, therefore,"
contains only the answers to the problems that are real to him.
But if we stop to consider the whole course of thought in the last
"two centuries, we shall realize that the idea of Progress, in many"
"different and even in contrasting forms, is the one around which all"
"our life, theoretical and practical, has centred in modern times. And"
"of that idea, Croce's philosophy is the most powerful and coherent"
expression that has ever appeared. It is only by considering the
"whole of reality as activity, and the values of reality as coinciding"
"with the forms of that activity, that Progress acquires a definite"
meaning: a progress which should be a constant approximation towards
"a preÃ«xistent ideal, or a material process external to ourselves,"
"would be a purely illusory one. In one case, our whole life would tend"
"towards making a duplicate of that which already is--a work, therefore,"
"without intrinsic worth, and without a real end; in the other, there"
"would be no work at all, no activity, no life."
But nothing seems more difficult to our mind than to keep together
the two ideas of progress and of truth. The natural sciences have
"made a gallant attempt at assimilating the idea of progress, and at"
"transforming themselves, ultimately, into history. But the static"
"concepts of naturalism resist that assimilation, and scientific"
immaculate and incorruptible life.[27]
Purgation of the soul was not effected solely by liturgic acts but also by
self-denial and suffering.[28] The meaning of the term _expiatio_ changed.
"Expiation, or atonement, was no longer accomplished by the exact"
performance of certain ceremonies pleasing to the gods and required by a
"sacred code like a penalty for damages, but by privation and personal"
"suffering. Abstinence, which prevented the introduction of deadly elements"
"into the system, and chastity, which preserved man from pollution and"
"debility, became means of getting rid of the domination of the evil powers"
"and of regaining heavenly favor.[29] Macerations, laborious pilgrimages,"
"public confessions, sometimes flagellations and mutilations, in fact all"
forms of penance and mortifications uplifted the fallen man and brought him
nearer to the gods. In Phrygia a sinner would write his sin and the
punishment he suffered upon a stela for every one to see and would return
thanks to heaven that his prayer of repentance had been heard.[30] The
"Syrian, who had offended his goddess by eating her sacred fish, dressed in"
"sordid rags, covered himself with a sack and sat in the public highway"
humbly to proclaim his misdeed in order to obtain forgiveness.[31] {41}
"""Three times, in the depths of winter,"" says Juvenal, ""the devotee of Isis"
"will dive into the chilly waters of the Tiber, and shivering with cold,"
will drag herself around the temple upon her bleeding knees; if the goddess
"commands, she will go to the outskirts of Egypt to take water from the Nile"
"and empty it within the sanctuary.""[32] This shows the introduction into"
Europe of Oriental asceticism.
But there were impious acts and impure passions that contaminated and
defiled the soul. Since this infection could be destroyed only by
"expiations prescribed by the gods, the extent of the sin and the character"
of the necessary penance had to be estimated. It was the priest's
prerogative to judge the misdeeds and to impose the penalties. This
circumstance gave the clergy a very different character from the one it had
"ACTION.--Aloes is a purgative, acting chiefly on the large intestines;"
small doses are bitter tonics; it stimulates both peristalsis and
"secretion, increases secretion of bile; is also diuretic; applied"
externally it is stimulant and desiccant; the Barbadoes is the most
active and uniform in its effects.
"Aloes should be kept in lumps in tin cans or other good containers, only"
powdered for immediate use; in melting aloes don’t let the temperature
rise above 120 degrees as it impairs the activity by converting the
active aloin into inert resin. Aloes operate in from 12 to 24 hours
after administration; don’t repeat an aloetic purge until 24 hours have
"elapsed. It also does not cause catharsis. In about 15 hours, the"
"patient should be exercised, but returned to the stall as soon as the"
"desired effect is evident. If it fails to act in 24 hours, linseed oil"
"may be given. Aloin appears to contain the active principles of aloes,"
"and is usually as operative, but some manufactures are ineffective."
"USES INTERNAL.--In dyspepsia with capricious appetite, irregularity of"
"the bowels, hide-bound horses, worms; is used in colic, both spasmodic"
"and flatulent, for overloaded condition of the bowels; to promote"
"excretion of waste products from the bowels and the blood, and"
"consequently relieve febrile symptoms; rheumatic attacks, skin"
"irritation, swollen limbs and inflamed joints; in lymphangitis to"
"prevent and aid in curing. By attracting the blood to the bowels, it is"
"useful in congestion or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, full"
"doses being necessary; in paralysis, paraplegia or hemiplegia or"
"reflexed paralysis due to indigestion, give full doses. Aloes should not"
be used in irritation or inflammation of the alimentary canal or piles.
It is not advisable to give an aloetic purge when the temperature is
above 102° F. Nor in hemorrhage from the rectum; in high fevers it is
"apt to cause superpurgation, also should not be used where there is"
great debility or weakness. In influenza the bowels are apt to be
"paw, as if in contact with water, after any disagreeable experiences."
"The symbolism that to-day interpenetrates our language, and indeed our"
"life generally, has mostly been inherited by us, with the traditions of"
"civilisation, from an antiquity so primitive that we usually fail to"
interpret it. The rare additions we make to it in our ordinary normal
life are for the most part deliberately conscious. But so soon as we
"fall below, or rise above, that ordinary normal level--to insanity and"
"hallucination, to childhood, to savagery, to folk-lore and legend, to"
poetry and religion--we are at once plunged into a sea of symbolism.[140]
"There is even a normal sphere in which symbolism has free scope, and that"
is in the world of dreams.
"Oneiromancy, the symbolical interpretation of dreams, more especially as"
"a method of divining the future, is a widespread art in early stages of"
culture. The discerning of dreams is represented in the Old Testament as
a very serious and anxious matter (as in regard to Pharaoh's dream of the
"fat and lean cattle), and, nearer to our time, the dreams of great heroes,"
"especially Charlemagne, are represented as highly important events in the"
mediæval European epics. Little manuals on the interpretation of dreams
"have always been much valued by the uncultured classes, and among our"
"current popular sayings there are many dicta concerning the significance,"
"or the good or ill luck, of particular kinds of dreams."
Oneiromancy has thus slowly degenerated to folk-lore and superstition.
But at the outset it possessed something of the combined dignities of
religion and of science. Not only were the old dream interpreters careful
"of the significance and results of individual dreams, in order to build"
"up a body of doctrine, but they held that not every dream contained"
in it a divine message; thus they would not condescend to interpret
"dreams following on the drinking of wine, for only to the temperate,"
"they declared, do the gods reveal their secrets.[141] The serious and"
"round the monarch at Versailles. The young King Louis XVI., it is"
"true, carried through several reforms, but he had not enough strength"
of will to abolish the absurd immunities from taxation which freed the
"nobles and titled clergy from the burdens of the State. Thus, down to"
"1789, the middle classes and peasants bore nearly all the weight of"
"taxation, while the peasants were also encumbered by feudal dues and"
tolls. These were the crying grievances which united in a solid
"phalanx both thinkers and practical men, and thereby gave an immense"
impetus to the levelling doctrines of Rousseau.
"Two only of his political teachings concern us here, namely, social"
equality and the unquestioned supremacy of the State; for to these
"dogmas, when they seemed doomed to political bankruptcy, Napoleon"
"Buonaparte was to act as residuary legatee. According to Rousseau,"
"society and government originated in a social contract, whereby all"
members of the community have equal rights. It matters not that the
spirit of the contract may have evaporated amidst the miasma of
luxury. That is a violation of civil society; and members are
justified in reverting at once to the primitive ideal. If the
"existence of the body politic be endangered, force may be used:"
"""Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do"
so by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he shall be
"forced to be free."" Equally plausible and dangerous was his teaching"
as to the indivisibility of the general will. Deriving every public
"power from his social contract, he finds it easy to prove that the"
"sovereign power, vested in all the citizens, must be incorruptible,"
"inalienable, unrepresentable, indivisible, and indestructible."
Englishmen may now find it difficult to understand the enthusiasm
called forth by this quintessence of negations; but to Frenchman
recently escaped from the age of privilege and warring against the
"coalition of kings, the cry of the Republic one and indivisible was a"
"trumpet call to death or victory. Any shifts, even that of a"
say that both the aerial element and the actual rhythmic movement of the
ribs become accentuated during sleep.
That the respiratory element is the chief factor in dreams of flying is
clearly indicated by the fact that many persons subject to such dreams
are conscious on awaking from them of a sense of respiratory or cardiac
"disturbance. I am acquainted with a psychologist who, though not a"
"frequent dreamer, is subject to dreams of flying, which do not affect"
"him disagreeably, but on awaking from them he always perceives a slight"
"flutter of the heart. Any such sensation is by no means constant with me,"
but I have occasionally noted it down in exactly the same words after this
"kind of dream.[114] It is worth while to observe, in this connection, how"
"large a number of people, and especially very young people, associate"
their dreams of flying with staircases. The most frequent cause of cardiac
"and respiratory stimulation, especially in children, who constantly run up"
"and down them, is furnished by staircases, and though in health this fact"
"may not be obvious, it is undoubtedly registered unconsciously, and may"
thus be utilised by dreaming intelligence.
"There is, however, another element entering into the problem of nocturnal"
aviation: the state of the skin sensations. Respiratory activity alone
would scarcely suffice to produce the imagery of flight if sensations of
"tactile pressure remained to suggest contact with the earth. In dreams,"
"however, the sense of movement suggested by respiratory activity is"
unaccompanied by the tactile pressure produced by boots or the contact
"of the ground with the soles of the feet. In addition, also, there is"
"probably, as Bergson also has suggested, a numbness due to pressure on"
the parts supporting the weight of the body. Sleep is not a constant and
uniform state of consciousness; a heightened consciousness of respiration
may easily co-exist with a diminished consciousness of tactile pressure
"due to anaesthesia of the skin.[115] In normal sleep it may, indeed, be"
said that the conditions are probably often favourable to the production
But his selfish support merely sanctioned a power already established. The
propaganda of the Oriental religions was originally democratic and
sometimes even revolutionary like the Isis worship. Step by step they
"advanced, always reaching higher social classes and appealing to popular"
conscience rather than to the zeal of functionaries.
"As a matter of fact all these religions, except that of Mithra, seem at"
first sight to be far less austere than the Roman creed. We shall have
occasion to note that they contained coarse and immodest fables and
atrocious or vile rites. The Egyptian gods were expelled from Rome by
"Augustus and Tiberius on the charge of being immoral, but they were called"
immoral principally because they opposed a certain conception of the social
order. They gave little attention to the public interest but attached
considerable importance to the inner life and consequently to the value of
"the individual. Two new things, in particular, were brought to Italy by the"
"Oriental priests: mysterious methods of purification, by which they claimed"
"to wash away the impurities of the soul, and the assurance that a blessed"
immortality would be the reward of piety.[23]
These religions pretended to restore lost purity[24] to the soul either
through the performance of ritual ceremonies or through mortifications and
penance. They had a series of ablutions and lustrations supposed to restore
original innocence to the mystic. He had to wash himself in the sacred
"water according to certain prescribed forms. This was really a magic rite,"
"because bodily purity acted sympathetically upon the soul, or {40} else it"
was a real spiritual disinfection with the water driving out the evil
"spirits that had caused pollution. The votary, again, might drink or"
besprinkle himself with the blood of a slaughtered victim or of the priests
"themselves, in which case the prevailing idea was that the liquid"
circulating in the veins was a vivifying principle capable of imparting a
new existence.[25] These and similar rites[26] used in the mysteries were
supposed to regenerate the initiated person and to restore him to an
"phenomena of fatigue and depression, together with possibilities of"
"recovery and of exaltation, yet also that of permanent irresponsiveness"
which is associated with death. I was filled with awe at this stupendous
generalisation; and it was with great hope that I announced my results
"before the Royal Society,--results demonstrated by experiments. But the"
"physiologists present advised me, after my address, to confine myself to"
"physical investigations in which my success had been assured, rather"
than encroach on their preserve. I had thus unwittingly strayed into the
domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system and so offended its
etiquette. An unconscious theological bias was also present which
"confounds ignorance with faith. It is forgotten that He, who surrounded"
"us with this ever-evolving mystery of creation, the ineffable wonder"
"that lies hidden in the microcosm of the dust particle, enclosing within"
"the intricacies of its atomic form all the mystery of the cosmos, has"
also implanted in us the desire to question and understand. To the
theological bias was added the misgivings about the inherent bent of the
Indian mind towards mysticism and unchecked imagination. But in India
this burning imagination which can extort new order out of a mass of
"apparently contradictory facts, is also held in check by the habit of"
meditation. It is this restraint which confers the power to hold the
"mind in pursuit of truth, in infinite patience, to wait, and reconsider,"
to experimentally test and repeatedly verify.
"It is but natural that there should be prejudice, even in science,"
against all innovations; and I was prepared to wait till the first
incredulity could be overcome by further cumulative evidence.
Unfortunately there were other incidents and misrepresentations which it
was impossible to remove from this insulating distance. Thus no
conditions could have been more desperately hopeless than those which
confronted me for the next twelve years. It is necessary to make this
brief reference to this period of my life; for one who would devote
himself to the search of truth must realise that for him there awaits no
There is another consideration which may be put forward to account for
one group of dream-symbolisms. It has been found that certain hysterical
subjects of old standing when in the hypnotic state are able to receive
"mental pictures of their own viscera, even though they may be quite"
"ignorant of any knowledge of the shape of these viscera. This _autoscopy_,"
"as it has been called, has been specially studied by Féré, Comar, and"
Sollier.[149] Hysteria is a condition which is in many respects closely
"allied to sleep, and if it is to be accepted as a real fact that autoscopy"
occasionally occurs in the abnormal psychic state of hypnotic sleep in
"hysterical persons, it is possible to ask whether it may not sometimes"
occur normally in the allied state of sleep. In the hypnotic state it
is known that parts of the organism normally involuntary may become
subject to the will; it is not incredible that similarly parts normally
insensitive may become sufficiently sensitive to reveal their own shape
"or condition. We may thus, indeed, the more easily understand those"
premonitory dreams in which the dreamer becomes conscious of morbid
conditions which are not perceptible to waking consciousness until they
have attained a greater degree of intensity.[150]
The recognition of the transformation in dream life of internal
sensations into symbolic motor imagery is ancient. Hippocrates said that
"to dream, for instance, of springs and wells denoted some disturbance of"
"the bladder. In such a case a disturbed bladder sends to the brain, not"
"the naked message of its own needs, but a symbolic message of those needs"
"in motor imagery, as (in one case known to me) of a large cistern with"
a stream of water flowing from it.[151] Sometimes the symbolism aroused
by visceral processes remains physiological; thus indigestion frequently
"leads to dreams of eating, as of chewing all sorts of inedible and"
"repulsive substances, and occasionally--it would seem more abnormally--to"
agreeable dreams of food.
"It is due to the genius of Professor Sigmund Freud, of Vienna--to-day"
"intellect and the conscience at the same time, and therefore gained a hold"
"on the entire man. {44} Compared with the ancient creeds, they appear to"
"have offered greater beauty of ritual, greater truth of doctrine and a far"
superior morality. The imposing ceremonial of their festivities and the
"alternating pomp and sensuality, gloom and exaltation of their services"
"appealed especially to the simple and the humble, while the progressive"
"revelation of ancient wisdom, inherited from the old and distant Orient,"
captivated the cultured mind. The emotions excited by these religions and
"the consolations offered strongly attracted the women, who were the most"
fervent and generous followers and most passionate propagandists[40] of the
religions of Isis and Cybele. Mithra was worshiped almost exclusively by
"men, whom he subjected to a rigid moral discipline. Thus souls were gained"
by the promise of spiritual purification and the prospect of eternal
happiness.
"The worship of the Roman gods was a civic duty, the worship of the foreign"
gods the expression of a personal belief. The latter were the objects of
"the thoughts, feelings and intimate aspirations of the individual, not"
"merely of the traditional and, one might say, functional adoration of the"
citizen. The ancient municipal devotions were connected with a number of
earthly interests that helped to support each other. They were one of
various forms of family spirit and patriotism and guaranteed the prosperity
"of the community. The Oriental mysteries, directing the will toward an"
"ideal goal and exalting the inner spirit, were less mindful of economic"
"utility, but they could produce that vibration of the moral being that"
"caused emotions, stronger than any rational faculty, to gush forth from the"
depths of the soul. Through a sudden illumination {45} they furnished the
intuition of a spiritual life whose intensity made all material happiness
appear insipid and contemptible. This stirring appeal of supernatural life
made the propaganda irresistible. The same ardent enthusiasm guaranteed at
the same time the uncontested domination of neo-Platonism among the
philosophers. Antiquity expired and a new era was born.
"survivals of Platonism are relics of formalistic logic, still very"
"frequent in contemporary culture, and a belief in what might be called"
"average truth, mechanically extracted from an external and material"
"consensus of opinions. But with this conception of truth, we touch the"
border line between idealistic and naturalistic transcendentalism.
The most common attitude of contemporary thought (and the one that is
"therefore usually designated as common sense, and as such opposed to"
philosophy) is a naively naturalistic one. But it would be a mistake
"to regard it as a simple and spontaneous attitude, and to identify it,"
"for instance, with the naÃ¯ve intuition of the artist, with a first"
grade of knowledge as yet untroubled by logical problems. The artist's
"vision is more distant from naturalism than the philosopher's concept,"
"since common sense, however unreflected and illogical, is in itself"
"a philosophy, and, though it may sound paradoxical, a transcendental"
one. The artist constantly identifies himself with his object; in his
"consciousness, the distinction between subject and object has not"
yet arisen. But the naÃ¯ve naturalism of which we are now speaking
"is posterior to the logical judgment, in which that distinction"
first appears; and is obtained by keeping separate the two terms of
"the judgment, each of which exists only in relation to the other,"
and by transforming that relation into a quality of the object. The
unity thus disrupted is artificially reconstituted by abolishing the
"subject, that is, by treating the subject itself as merely an object"
"among many objects, or as a mere abstract intersection of objects. It"
"is with this form of naturalism that realism generally coincides, and"
its abstracting process is the one that has been recently systematized
by the New Realists. The justification of the naturalistic conception
"of truth, as truth of description, and the motive of its present"
"popularity, is that it rests on a method of knowledge which is"
"indispensable to the natural and mathematical sciences, and that the"
"sciences have come to usurp, in modern times, for reasons which are"
"clouds of lies, and half-truths, and misleading phrases, and judgments"
distorted by hatred and warped by malice. And as for those who were
either lured on to perpetrate the great iniquity by grandiose and
seductive falsehoods or were dragged from their homes and families and
"sent unwilling to the slaughter, these miserable slaves the Press of all"
"countries urged on, one against the other, brutally deaf to their"
"misery, representing them as glad and cheerful when they had reached the"
"extreme of human suffering, magnifying them into heroes of epic"
"proportions (before they donned their dingy garb of war they were ""lice"""
"that had to be ""combed out""), endowing them with absurdly impossible"
virtues--when they were just ordinary human beings in misfortune with no
ambition except to live in peace and comfort--and at the same time
"bestowing lofty patronage upon them and calling them ""Tommies"" and"
"sending them cigarettes, chocolates and advice, as though they were"
"children to be petted, with no will or intelligence of their own."
"The Press, the cinema, the atrocity placards, and propagandist leaflets,"
they all practised the same deliberate and colossal deceit and kindled
hatred against the enemy. And so successful was this diabolical
conspiracy that hatred became second nature to vast masses of people. To
"think evil of the enemy was an article of national faith, and to"
"question this faith, or still more to repudiate it, that was heresy of"
"the most heinous kind. Religion died long ago, but the cult of"
nationalism that replaced it was infinitely more pernicious in its
intolerance and cruelty than religion at its very worst.
"Individually men are often good, but collectively men are always bad."
"The national mob had never been so powerful, nor had it ever been so"
"servile, and that was why its passions were those of the coward and not"
of the brave man; that was why chivalry and generosity and
"fair-mindedness were execrated, and only hatred and boastfulness and"
vindictive malice were allowed to live.
"Some temperature charts, in illustration of this point, are added to the"
"cases quoted later. The explanation of the recurrent hæmorrhages is, I"
"think, to be found in the reduction of the intra-thoracic pressure with"
coagulation and shrinkage of the clot in the pleura in the patients kept
"quiet in bed, while in the patients who had to travel it was probably"
the result of direct mechanical disturbance.
In many of these cases a pleural rub was audible at the upper margin of
the dulness with the development of the fresh symptoms. Whether this was
due to actual pleurisy or to the rubbing of surfaces rough from the
breaking down of slight recent adhesions which had formed a barrier to
"the effusion, I am unable to say, but the signs were fairly constant. In"
"some instances the increase in the amount of fluid was, no doubt, due to"
pleural effusion resulting from irritation from the presence of
"blood-clot, or perhaps the shifting of the latter; in these the"
secondary rise of temperature may well be ascribed to the development of
pleurisy.
"I am inclined to believe, however, that the primary rise of temperature"
was similar to that seen when blood accumulates in the peritoneal cavity
"as the result of trauma, and the secondary rises in most cases to those"
which we saw so frequently accompanying the interstitial secondary
"hæmorrhages spoken of in Chapter IV., and are to be explained on the"
theory of absorption of a blood ferment. The secondary rises always
"occurred with a fresh effusion, often of blood, occasioning an"
"extension, which broke down probable light adhesions and exposed a fresh"
area of normal pleural membrane to act as a surface for absorption.
"It is, of course, manifest that the fever might also be ascribed to the"
"infection of the clot or serum from without, and in the first cases I"
"saw I was inclined to take this view, since we had in every case the"
"primary wounds of chest-wall, and possibly of lung, and in some the"
"or intellectualism, which are still visible in the _Estetica_, is the"
"logic of the pure concept, which resolves in the concrete universal the"
"dualisms of nature and spirit, of fact and value, of life and thought,"
"and, finally, of history and philosophy. But while this logic can be"
"seen at work in all the parts of the system, and is, in fact, the form"
towards which all Croce's thoughts seem to have constantly tended from
"the time of his earliest philosophical essays, yet, to an attentive"
"eye, it is possible to discover the successive stages by which it"
"actually incorporated itself in the system. In particular, we have been"
able to point to the effects of the later meditations on the philosophy
"of will, on one side, on a more intimate understanding of the pure"
"intuition as the lyrical intuition, on the other, on the identification"
"of the definition with the individual judgment, and thereby on the"
relations between history and philosophy. On the whole it can be said
that two apparently contrasting directions were at work within the
system itself: one reflecting Croce's mental need for clear and fine
"distinctions, the other, that deep consciousness of the unity of the"
"real, without which all distinctions tend to solidify themselves into"
dead abstractions.
"If we imagine two students of Croce's philosophy, endowed with"
"antagonistic philosophical temperaments, the one a dialectician,"
"the other a mystic, we can easily conceive them as the founders of"
two diametrically opposed schools of thought. The first would have
"emphasized the rigorous distinctions, the formal character, the"
intellectual precision of the system; he might have retained the
"identification of philosophy and history, but to him these words would"

But not when I'm around you.
That's very sweet.
"I'm very grateful, but..."
"Willy, I'm too old for you."
My mom and dad got married when she was 17.
"Yes, that's different."
That's old enough for a girl to get married.
And I feel snake eyes.
"Krause, give Mr. Murdock back the dice he had bef ore."
"I'd be delighted to have you roll f or any part, or all of the 16,000."
Let's say all of it.
- Four.
"- A difficult point, Mr. Murdock."
"What man has done, Murdock can do."
"- Please, Rip, I'm 16,000 ahead."
- Bother you?
A solid winning every now and then is the best advertising f or any casino.
- Can't we have a nightcap?
- lt's your money.
We'll have it in my office.
"If it's all the same to you, I'd like that pair f or a souvenir."
Much obliged.
"With all that money on you, I'd better see you home."
Snake eyes again.
Krause is a f ool.
My cutting him in on the profits was a mistake.
He's becoming greedy.
I'll keep these to remind me never to stretch my luck.
"A judicious principle. I gather that you've been around, as the saying is."
- East St. Louis is around enough.
"- Ah, St. Louis."
"In what business were you, may I ask?"
"I owned taxicabs, but they got sunk at Pearl Harbor."
- Then you know Al Baretto?
- You know Al?
Were you in St. Louis?
"Many times, although my headquarters were in Detroit."
I thought Al's Detroit f riends were all mobsters.
Where's Mike?
I had already decided I was gonna leave my husband.
-I just had to wait for... -your father to die.
"-When you say it,it sounds horrible."
"-Well,yeah.It is."
"If dad knew I was getting a divorce, he'd have disowned me."
She inherited $2 million last month when dad died.
Ah... how about if you were a murderer?
I didn't kill james.
You buried him.
No.
I did not even know that he was dead.
I will admit that we had a fight.
"James wanted to borrow money... and I refused,and he got angry,and... and he said that we were throug he got up to leave."
I just wanted m to stay.
"I,uh... took his cigarettes."
-Give 'em back!
-No!
-Now!
No!
-Not unless you promisemes!
"I just got in my car,and I drove for hours."
"I came back to-to check on him, to see if he was okay,but..."
"-he was dead,so you buried him."
-No.
James was gone.
"I thought that he was fine, until I went to that house for the showing the other day."
And there he was.
And I could only think of one explanation.
It was the hand of god.
Can gibbs arrest god?
I don't know it's like the thing tryg to bring in the hulk.
She's telling the truth.
"I mean, someone gave it to me."
Who?
"Um, I think his name was Alan or Adam, something like that."
Where or when did he give you the chip?
I'll tell you if you give me Elton John tickets.
Done.
"Okay, well, like, let's see 'em."
"Elton John, front row, tomorrow night."
Ah!
"Like, talk."
I remember his name-Alex.
Alex.
Great.
"Um, when did he give you the chip?"
"Well, see, I was over by the fountains, you know, at the Bellagio, and when I left, this guy Alex sees me, like, a couple of blocks away and he's like,"
"""I saw you over by the fountains."
"Where are you staying?"""
"And he's kinda hot, so I'm like, ""the Montecito."""
"Um, where did he give you the chip?"
- Here.
- Here?
- In your room?
"- Well, like, we had drinks at Pure."
"And then he's like, ""Do you want to go back to your room?"""
"And I'm kinda drunk, so I'm like, ""Okay."""
"And then after we hook up, he goes, ""Here,"" ya know, with the chip."
"And I'm like, ""I'm so not that type of a girl."""
"And he's like, ""I know."
"I just, like, like you, so I'm giving you this."""
Completely believable.
Did Alex say he had to leave because he had an early morning meeting he had to get up for?
Yeah.
Or not.
And you don't have the harder part.
I have the harder part.
He wants me to meet him at his house and lie to Mr. Boykewich.
"If we all get caught, what's Mr. Boykewich going to think of us after all he's done for us?"
He's going to think we're Ben's friends.
But we don't want Ben with Dylan.
We don't like Dylan.
She's okay.
"No, she's not."
She got him in trouble.
"First it was the pot, then it was the fire, what's next?"
Is she going to have him murder someone?
No.
I'm not going to do it.
I don't like her.
And I don't like him dating her.
"And for once, he should do what his father tells him and we should encourage him to do what his father tells him."
That's what a real friend would do.
That's not what a real friend would do.
A real friend would do anything a friend needs him or her to do.
I'm happy you said that.
Anything?
Yeah.
What if Ben asked you to have sex with him.
"Well, that's ridiculous."
Ben would never ask me to have sex with him.
Ben didn't...
"Ben didn't ask you to have sex with him, did he?"
Did he?
Did you?
When!
I'm glad I know that too.
"I mean, that you love him."
"If I hated him, I'd be all right, then we could walk down the street together and I wouldn't mind feeling him cringe, never let on."
I should've gone away from here a long time ago.
But he's hard to leave.
-Now I gotta get out of here fast.
"-Don't run away, Brock."
"Mr. McCurtin could get you off, couldn't he;"
"Oh, sure, easy."
Jury wouldn't even leave its box.
-Then face it like Papa wants you to.
"-Ever been to a trial, Sarah Beth;"
Lots of things come out of trials.
Whole mess comes out.
Salt Fork would eat this up with a spoon.
And he's had enough.
"Go on, Sarah Beth, sit down and play a tune by yourself."
You'll have to get used to it.
And tell the colonel nothing.
Jeff said McCurtin was here.
What'd he want;
-Nothing.
-Where you going;
-First lap on my trip to Denver.
"-Get down off that horse, Brock."
Get out of my way.
"Well, Sarah Beth, I'll try to understand why he had to go."
I didn't try with someone else a long time ago.
I've always been sorry.
"Well, colonel, then if Brock ain't here, we just gotta find him and take him in."
-Why;
-l thought McCurtin told you.
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in arrests.
"What was it, over 100 again last year?"
Terrific.
But who?
What did you bring in?
A high-school kid in short pants that had a twitch?
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock?
"Walter, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a desert full ofjunkies waiting to get well.
"Goddamnit, this could be it."
"This little candy-store guy, he's put on a big show... ..in a club with no narcotics connections."
They were all over him.
"And after working a day and night, we tail him to Brooklyn."
"And we sat on him for practically a week, and who do we come up with?"
Joel Weinstock.
Now you gotta let us have it.
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
"No, two wires."
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wire tap, don't you?"
- But you'll try.
"- We know you can do it, Walt."
"Popeye, you still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?"
J'entends parler de ça.
Je n'arrive pas á y croire.
Alorsje vais un peuparlerpourmoi.
"J'ai tendance á... penser á mes propres problémes, enfiin..."
"Monsieur Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York?"
"- Yes, it's my first."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
* sitting in the back * * of this Cadillac * * thinking I work way too hard * * to be where I'm at * * blinded by the cars * * in the boulevards *
* I always took my cues * * from the real star *
"* I've got a plan * * in the palm of my hand * * to get me going, oh no * * but I'm just trying * * to get by *"
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
"Yeah, we get it."
You're good looking.
"Look, doesn't anybody have anything new to say?"
"So there's this car that runs on water, man."
"It runs on water, man!"
"Okay, Nina, I brought you the special."
"One small soda, one medium popcorn... and one large Fez, dark and sweet."
"Fez, you know I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you."
"Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact."
"It would've been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize."
Now enjoy your meal.
"If you need me, I'll be smelling your neck."
"Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel like I need some space."
"But I want you to know it's not you, it's me."
Okay.
"Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing."
That's sort of gross.
"Hey, it may be gross, but that's the way I learned how to count."

Six Million Dollar Man.
That's like a $20 jumpsuit and a $4 haircut.
Mmm.
Where did all the money go?
I think we've seen this episode.
Yeah.
And we were sitting in these exact same seats when we saw it.
"Actually, you were sitting over there."
"I remember, 'cause I could see up your skirt."
"You guys, we do the exact same thing every day."
"TV, snack, nap."
"Nah, you should frame it, or take it to one of those places where they encase stuff in plastic."
I'm a key employee.
Gaming Commission says key employees... aren't allowed to wager at the casino that employs them.
This was given to you by somebody who was repaying a debt.
But they're gonna have me on video cashing the thing in.
That doesn't look good.
"No, no, no."
"Hey, man, you want to make a little money?"
Yeah.
"Cash this in for me, I'll give you 10%."
That's 200 bucks.
"There's a catch, right?"
No catch.
He's just lazy.
'Cause he's lazy.
"That's hard, man."
Right.
Two thousand bucks.
How 'bout that?
"So, how are things going?"
I was gonna head over to my dad's and start clearing the place out.
"Ah, good move."
Mary's gonna go with me.
Ah.
It's easier to go in with someone else.
"- Yeah, I hear ya."
"- Hey, guys."
"I know you didn't find anything on that guy that took my wallet, but here's the thing."
"I've been looking all day for a betting slip, and then I remembered it's in my wallet."
"It was a five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Seahawks, Chargers, Lions, for God's sake."
It's the first time in my life I got 'em all right.
"Ticket's worth $2,000."
What he did was illegal.
"You know, with this kind ofthing, you gotto be brutal."
"A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired."
"Really, I mean, you do it like the Germans in World War II."
"Theywentthrough these towns, and a sniper hitone of'em, they'd line the whole goddamn town up and say,"
"""Untilyou talk, you're all getting shot."""
"Really, I think that's what has to be done."
I don'tthink you can be Mr. Nice Guy anymore.
"[Colson] You justwhisperthe word to me, and I'll shoot Ellsberg myself."
- [Ehrlichman] We're not Germans.
- Yeah.
Ellsberg's notthe issue.
The Pentagon papers aren'tthe issue.
It's the lie.
- [Crowd Cheering] - [Chambers] Mr. Hiss is lying.
Yeah.
"Remember, John, back in '48?"
Nobody believed Alger Hiss was a Communistexceptme.
"Well, they loved Hiss like they loved this Ellsberg character."
He was their kind- Ivy League establishment.
"I am not, and never have been..."
- Mr. Hiss is lying.
- Mr. Hiss?
"- I was dirt to them, nothing."
- And Dick kicked the shitoutof'em.
I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.
"The documents were old and outof date, just like these Pentagon papers."
The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.
Then people bought that he was a spy.
It's the lie that gets you.
"All right, Henry, we're gonna go yourway."
Crush this Ellsberg same waywe did Hiss.
I'm gonna have some coffee.
"What do you want, some, uh, milk, or what?"
Milk?
Coffee's fine.
- Yeah.
I drink it.
I'm hip.
- (CLICKS FINGERS)
I don't know.
"This is espresso, you know?"
It's like coffee-zilla.
"I said, I'm hip."
So she moved me up a grade because I wasn't fitting in.
"So, now I'm even more not fitting in."
I was getting good grades.
"You know, like all A's."
"So, my mom says, ""You need stimulation."""
"And I go, ""No, I'm stimulated enough right now."""
- That's for sure.
"- She goes,"
"""Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge."
"""You need a challenge."" So, now I'm challenged, all right."
"I'm challenged to hold on to my lunch money, because of all the big mooses who wanna pound me because I'm a shrimpy dork who thinks he's smarter than them."
"But I don't think I am smarter, I just do the stupid homework."
If everyone else just did the stupid homework they could move up a grade and get pounded too.
Is there anymore coffee?
"Look, it's really none of my business, kid, but, um, who cares what these creeps think, you know?"
They don't decide who you are.
You do.
You are who you choose to be.
(CLATTERING)
Did you hear that?
"Yes, it's the Queen."
"According to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Family cost each of us 61p per person per year."
But they have made some cutbacks -
"Diana, Margaret and the Queen Mum have all been laid off."
GASPS AND GROANS
Treason.
Hur-gh-gh!
At least Jules'll be all right.
"So those were the top three most popular Brits, but others include, Adele."
"Adele was offered a place at Liverpool University, but turned it down to pursue music."
"Sure, it's paid off in the short term, but what she got to fall back on?"
That 200 million isn't going to last for ever.
Mo Farah.
Mo was famously the face of Quorn.
"Weird, I thought the face of Quorn was..."
APPLAUSE
And Simon Cowell.
Simon Cowell left school just two O-levels and look at him now - still a fucking moron.
"So, at the end of that round Rob, Ellie and Richard have no points."
"Aisling, Jessica and David have three points."
"That's it for part two, see you after the break."
Welcome back to 8 Out Of 10 Cats.
Our next round is Pick Of The Polls.
"Rob, Ellie, Richard - what do you like the look of?"
"Oh, we've got to go for our Ricky O, don't we?"
Ricky Osman.
OK.
Most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show.
True or false?
False!
LAUGHTER I'm afraid you're wrong.
Aww.
What am I doing?
I'm trying to keep the little girl alive.
"I put a man up there, I told him if he had a clean shot, he should take it."
"And he missed, and we'll be lucky to get her out alive."
Pull everybody back.
And do what?
What do you suggest?
We should call CNN for him?
This little girl is everything.
She's what it's all about.
We can't afford to lose her.
( cell phone rings )
Yes.
Ray.
I am so sorry about what happened by the window.
There are some people out here who've seen too many Lethai Weapon movies.
Look up at the window.
You get me what I want.
Do it now.
RAY:
Go sit down with your mum and dad.
"You don't have to be scared, Mum."
This is all going to be all right.
A lot of things are going to happen because of this.
That's all.
But it's going to be all right.
"You better hope you're right, or you're gonna have to start praying for a little intervention from your grandfather's side of the family."
You're not gonna get it any cleaner.
He's gonna kill her.
We've gotta take him out.
"I'm not gonna be a party to any more killing, Mary."
I'm done with that.
So I swam around in the pool with a shirt on.
"But then you pop out the pool, and everybody can see your breasts anyway."
"It's like, ""Well, nigga, it's a wet T-shirt contest."""
"""We can--we can see your titties, and you won, nigga."
You won.
"You really did."""
All I'm saying is you gotta have fun with your life.
Just have fun.
"People, Kanye West looks like he has a lot of fun with his life."
But what is wrong with that guy?
What is wrong with Kanye West?
I think it's because he's got the short man complex.
You know what I'm talking about?
"Anybody under 5'5"" is mad at the world for no fucking reason."
"And I understand Kanye West is 5'8"", but he got the swagger of a Keebler Elf."
That's all I'm trying to say to you.
Kanye West is a Keebler Elf.
"That's funny as hell, I'm sorry."
He be--
"""Hold on, fam."
"""Who else you know--"
"""Who else you know can take swirls"
"""and connect them with the chocolate chips"
"""just like I did, fam?"
"""Can't nobody do that like I did, fam."
"""Yo, fuck all these elves, fam!"
"""It's me, heh-heh!"
"I am a God."""
What the fuck?
Even Katt Williams would look at him like...
"""Nigga, you need to calm"
"""your ass down, boo-boo."
You watched me pass out.
Doctor said the bullet you put in me missed my vital organs.
"Well, uh, lucky me."
"Because, uh, now I get to collect the money that you hid from me, Paul."
"Or, sorry, what are you calling yourself now?"
Craig?
Heh.
"You know, heh, I couldn't believe when I saw you on that game show."
I thought I was losing my mind.
"But there you were, in the flesh."
A second chance at getting what's mine.
"No, the money belonged to us."
"I figured you would double-cross me, so I moved it."
Smart boy.
"But, uh, you're not so smart right now."
You listen to me.
I know about that Swiss Bank account where you moved my money to.
Now here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in that bank and you're gonna wire the money to yourself.
You're gonna get it out in cash.
You can't just walk into a bank and take out $4 million.
You just go in there and you get me what's mine.
All right.
Let's go.
- I said no cops.
- I didn't do anything.
"Go, go, go."
"Five-0 requesting back up, Pacific Rim Bank, shots fired."
Everybody out.
Are you the manager?
"Show me the back door, let's go."
"Chin, I see him."
My sources downtown are telling me they know who ann is.
L.A.P.D. Just identified her prints.
"We have got to turn her in now,ron."
Who's the homicide a.D.A. On duty?
"William matthew byrne,jr."
Ouch.
Byrne's tough.
"If we turn ann in now, byrne will be the trial d.A."
When does his shift end?
6:00 a.M. Then it's j.D. Keller.
Maybe we should wait.
"Hey,i am not afraid of byrne."
I'd rather go up against keller.
"Keller loves the media so much, he'll tip his trial strategy"
Just to get his name in the paper.
We'll know what he's gonna do in court before he does it.
"After he hit me,i landed here in the corner by the bed."
"He was here between me and the door,"
"And the cart was right here, where i grabbed the knife."
How?
Show me.
I just swung and ran past him.
So you had to use deadly force because he blocked your retreat.
Excellent.
Who's doing the investigation?
"It's a wobbler-- L.A.P.D.,"
Beverly hills p.D.-- Joint jurisdiction.
So they'll be fighting over who gets to make the arrest.
I love it.
Turf battles between cops always help the defense.
"The l.A.P.D. Will really want this one bad,"
So arrange to turn her in to the beverly hills p.D.
A baloney sandwitch and water.
"God damn, your family's poor, dude."
"Hey you, fellas, wanna go see High School Musical three tonight?"
Bunch of kids from school are gonna go see it again.
What's High School Musical three?
"You know, a sequel to High School Musical one and two."
What's High School Musical one and two?
This-
- This is not even condom its only's baloney sandwitch.
What's High School Musical one-
- DUDE!
Its only V most popular thing with kids in our age group.
Yeah!
Where the hell are you guys-- b-been?
Peru.
And then I saw High School Musical three again on friday and guess who was there.
Briden Gueermo.
"Briden Gueermo, oh, he's such a dream."
I'd give anything to be with Briden Gueermo.
But he'd never go for me.
I'm nobody.
"That's not true, Red."
Everyone has something that makes him unique.
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the be and let your spirit out.
As long as we got each other we'll never have any trouble that's what be in francis about
"Oh, Yeah Everyone is special in their own way and we'll always be together"
What the hell are they doing?
I've no idea.
--together.
Together we stay and every kid in school is special in their own way
"Dude, girls are such fags."
Are they farts or are they queefs?
Do you know what I mean?
This is the problem.
A front bottom one.
"I often think it's easier to say it's queef than a fart, because..."
I've never heard queef.
I'm enjoying queef.
I know.
A fanny fart.
"Yeah, but queef, what's that mean?"
I don't know where that came from.
It's an American word.
"Yeah, it is."
It's a pussy fart.
"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
When your cat farts.
Exactly!
"I don't think a man's as put off by a pussy fart, because they just think it's funny and it's often the result of something good happening."
"Whereas if you just let rip, a man's not going to go,"
"""I'm going to marry you for that revolting smell you just made."""
"Queef I think could be onomatopoeic, as in it's the sound it makes."
Queef!
"If you did willy farts, men would never stop doing willy farts."
"Oh, my God, it would be..."
Can you imagine it?
Especially if it made a whistling sound.
The joy that spread over your faces just thinking about that!
"If we could do willy farts, I would do one right here on this show."
"It should be like old Victorian policemen, you know."
Feep!
Feep!
"It's like a call - ""I need help'!"" Feep!"
Widowed for 10 years.
Her husband was AIban Lajeunesse.
"After he died, she sold her land, and kept the house..."
like a Iot of people around here...
"like me, too."
What happened?
"I was coming home from a date, happy, it had gone well between us."
It was exactly 1 :15.
"I slowed down in front of C,duIie's, all the lights were on outside."
"I saw polo, in his PJs, alone in the yard."
"I got out and I saw C,duIie with the gun."
"And then I saw the black guy, with eyes big as saucers."
"He came on his bike, but why come here?"
And why the gun?
"I asked C,duIie: "" What's going on?"""
What's going on is...
"what's going on... it's... that, there."
"...she said, showing her broken little plaster negro."
Then I understood what was going on.
"The statue was beyond repair, even for Crazy glue."
I Iooked at the kid and asked:
What got into you?
"Him, not a word."
He didn't seem to understand me.
So she told me:
Maybe he thinks it's ugly.
"That happens sometimes, huh?"
We don't all have the same taste.
"No, but you still got to be pretty shameless."
And he was shameless.
He didn't look at all ashamed.
"I took the gun from her, but she defended him and said:"
Where are your two pals?
Ray and Pluto?
They'll be here soon.
How soon is that?
I don't know.
They have to call first.
How do I know you're not lying to me right now?
How do I know they're not going to show up here any minute?
"I'm not lying to you, Dale."
What are you going to do with me?
Go on.
Get in the other room.
Go on.
Go on in the living room.
What are you doing?
Sit down.
No!
What are you doing?
"There's some fellows from L.A. that want to meet you, Lila."
"Dale, put the phone down."
Why should I do that?
'Cause Ray and Pluto are gonna be calling out here to see if everything is cool.
And I'm not going to answer the phone if you call those cops out.
"Oh, yes, you are."
I won't.
Goddamn it!
"Lila, even if I wanted to, I can't help you."
I don't have the legal authority.
"You didn't have the legal authority to fuck me when I was 17 years old, but that didn't stop you then, did it?"
"Yeah, that's right."
"Instead of sitting out there spying on me all night, why didn't you just come in here and say hello to your son?"
He's not my kid.
Nothin.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
"Listen, mister."
Connie called me.
"She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me."
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
Let's go.
"Pull over to the edge of town, man."
We're splitting up.
What are you talking about?
"Look, just pull over, man."
Everything's fucked up.
"I'll give you your half of the coke, you give me my half of the money, and then I'm gone."
"That's bullshit, man, I ain't doing that."
"Ray, don't fuck with me, just give me my money."
"I said I can't do that, man."
I don't have any money.
Say what?
I said I don't have any money.
"Where's my fucking money, Ray?"
"I said I ain't got any money, man!"
"She took the fucking money, all right?"
I've got 56 fucking dollars.
Now let go of me before I have a wreck.
"You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker, man."
"Now don't throw that shit on me, man."
That's your fucking buddies back there didn't have any goddamn money.
"That good friend of yours, Billy, man."
What the fuck am I doing with you?
"You're a pussy-whipped, sorry-ass motherfucker!"
Goddamn.
"Hey, look, if you want any money, you're going to have to go to Arkansas."
RONNIE:
"Come on, Lila, we got to go."
LILA:
I know.
"Just give me a few minutes with him, okay?"
"Come on, Lila, it's almost 4:00 in the morning."
A bit.
Don't catch a cold.
"When you get home, have a glass of hot milk, with some honey."
I will.
I like rainy days since I've been here.
Have you seen the new lawyer?
Yes.
He was here.
He told me everything.
"I'm screwed, right?"
"To be honest, yes."
At least Alicia wasn't affected by the birth.
It's the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope.
Are you all right?
I'd like to be able to hug you.
But I'd have to ask for a visavis.
"I checked it out, y'know?"
They asked if you were my boyfriend.
"I didn't dare to say yes, in case it bothered you."
It doesn't bother me at all.
You can say what you want.
I've hugged very few people in my life.
A message...
"Marco, I wanted to tell you how glad I was to see you today and be able to say goodbye."
You know they won't let me out of here.
Or it'll only be to lock me up somewhere else.
"I don't want to live in a world without Alicia, a place where I can't even have her hairclip with me."
So I've decided to escape.
"ldidn't tell you, so you wouldn't worry or try to stop me."
"A big hug, Marco."
Taxi!
To Segovia.
"""with the $12.95."
"And I got away with it."""
I had a gangster situation happen to me where I had to be gangster in the situation.
You just had to be.
"Sometimes you just gotta, you know, buck up and do what you gotta do."
I was trying to get a cab in February.
"The cabdriver saw me, looked at me, and then sped the hell off."
But he got caught at the red light that was right in front of me.
"So I was like, ""Oh, snap!"" So you know what I did?"
I went Denzel Washington Training Day on his ass right there.
I was like...
"""Okay, all right."""
"""Yeah, my nigga, my nigga."""
"""Yeah, so you're telling me"
"""you were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""That's what you're saying, right, huh?"
"""You were just gonna drive--"
"""That's what you saying."
Huh?
"""You were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""It's negative 20 degrees out here."
"""My fingers are about to fall off my hand,"
"""but you was about to drive the fuck off."
"""That's what you telling me, right?"
"""Okay, well, let me tell you something, Abu."
"""That's right."
"I said it, Abu."
"""You just live here."
I run shit here!
"King Kong ain't got shit on me!"""
He just ran the light.
He ain't want nothing to do with it.
That is nothing.
"I broke a chair, and I had a few words with him, that is all."
Don't you feel that you could be in trouble over Somers?
The way you talked about him over the phone to me--
Of course not.
That is not the trouble that worries me.
But you admit you are worried.
Don't make your lawyer's talk with me!
"Axel, have you been able to locate Edie Morrow?"
Who told you about her?
Lisa Pedersen.
Lisa is a snoop!
Listen to me.
This is not how Axel talks about people.
And yelling at his friends.
"That's all right, Axel."
"If you'll just explain the background of all this, perhaps we could help you find Miss Morrow."
If that's the thing that concerns you.
Ja.
"Ja, it is."
"And just one thing you must promise me, Mr. Mason."
"If you do find where Edie is, first tell me, not them."
Mr. Mason?
"Perry, this is Mr. Hadley."
"Sam Hadley, the furniture man."
"Oh, yes."
You were one of the bidders on the Norstaad Shop and trademark.
"- What can I do for you, Mr. Hadley?"
- Plenty.
"I was just talking to Axel on the phone, and he tells me that you're going to resolve this mess that he's got into."
"Are you assuming that now Mr. Somers is dead,"
Axel will sell his trademark to you?
Not a dime.
"Honest, Sarge, they all owe me."
"Listen, right next to Zimmerman's name, put ""KEOZ."""
"I'll know what it means-- ""Keep Eye On Zimmerman."""
"All right, dismissed."
"Hey, Sarge, I got a couple letters for you."
"Oh, those finance companies must have radar."
What's this?
"Oh, this is a joker."
"This is addressed to the house I used to live in way before the war, when I was still a civilian."
"Hey, Sarge, maybe you've been drafted, huh?"
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
"Oh, no."
Ten years.
"What is it, Ernie?"
It's just not possible.
Ten years.
"Hey, Ernie, come on back to us Earth people."
The squad I led in WWII-- way before I even met you guys-- they're having a reunion.
A reunion?
"Yeah, I forgot all about it."
"You see, we were pinned down on a beach in the Marianas, and we swore if we ever got out of it alive, we were going to meet ten years from that day for the biggest, fanciest banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria."
The Waldorf-Astoria?
"Man, what a crazy barrack."
(laughter)
"Oh, what a bunch of deadbeats they were."
"Wait a second, wait, hold this."
I got a picture of 'em in here someplace.
Get a load of that.
That's me holding the flag.
BARBELLA:
Let's see.
The Association sent him up to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
"You don't understand what's going on, do you?"
"No, I can't say as I do."
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
"Whiskey, George."
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
"- It's all right, Charles."
- Let's get started.
"- What'll I need, Joe?"
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
"Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?"
"- You mean, will he kill you?"
- Yes.
"I'm not going to let that happen, Charles."
A man like that you don't want to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest... and a German automatic over there in the drawer... one of the new ones.
What ?
"Oh, no !"
A rabbit ?
"I found him in the garage, and he was limping."
Let me see.
Careful.
"Baby, come here."
Let me see.
"You know, he seems like he's okay."
Maybe it's just a sprain.
"No, I can't take a chance, okay ?"
I have to go get him help.
"Summer, you can't."
It's too dangerous.
"I cannot wait here any longer, okay ?"
I have a missing boyfriend and a sick rabbit.
I cannot listen to any more of your mother's whining.
"Okay, I'll go with you."
We'll brave the zombies together.
"Mom, we're going to need to take Pancakes to the hospital."
Wait.
"This carrion gets help, but not me ?"
"We don't have a car, you can't walk."
There is no way to get you there.
"Taylor, I risked my life and hoofed it all the way from Emerald Bay, and you're just going to leave me here to rot ?"
"I have an idea, but I don't think you're going to like it."
This is not okay with me.
"Well, I told you you wouldn't like it."
"Mom, it's not that far to the hospital, and it's kind of this or nothing."
"Fine, but I'm not holding the rabbit... unless you promise I can make a vest out of him."
Okay.
I'll carry Pancakes.
"I was wearing a brown tie last night, not a red one."
This was a red one with a little figure on it.
I don't own such a--
Wait a minute.
- Was the figure sort of gray?
- That's right.
I think that's one of the ones I left at the office.
"Sure, that's it."
"You know, in case-- in case I lined up something kind of special."
"At the office, where anyone might have taken it?"
Yeah.
I mean no.
"A couple of months ago,"
Sandy spilled some soup and-- that's it.
That's the tie I loaned to Sandy.
"Beth, I have to see him."
Everything points in one direction.
Now if you want me to help your husband before the police get here--
"Perry, I don't know what I want-- just time to think, please."
"Beth, stop that sniveling."
You don't have to pretend to be loyal.
"Mr. Sandover, you went out to Lita Krail's cottage last night, didn't you?"
She lied to me.
She was up to something;
trying to get you into trouble.
She said she'd meet me in Phoenix.
She lied to me.
I bought a new sport coat.
I told her things-- things I never told anyone.
You thought she cared for you.
"What did she do, laugh at you?"
I didn't give her the chance.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
"Look, I can I just talk to you for a second, Dale?"
Just about you and me and about us and what's happening here.
What about us?
"I don't know, I just..."
I think I'm falling in love with you.
"And I know that scares you, and I-"
It's not gonna really-
"I'm not going anywhere, Dale."
I'm not gonna die on you.
"I'm not your mother, or your father."
You are so scared of anything that's real.
And I'm right here.
And I just want to know if you feel the same way.
"You hooked up with one of my best friends, Zach."
Wow.
"Wow, I thought I understood what was going on here."
But I guess I was just I guess I was just totally wrong.
I can't believe you're saying that about me.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
I just want something real.
I've been chasing you for two years Dale.
Two years.
You know how that feels?
But I can't do it anymore.
Not if you don't feel the same way about me.
"Goodbye, Dale."
I told Zach I want something real.
And here I go screwing up the best chance I'll ever have at something real.
What do you think I wished...
for my birthday?
It... starts with Z and ends with Ack.
And it turns out...
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"[Sighs] No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan."
But I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me.
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"- Have a seat, please."
- I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
I think you can help with that... and I think you will help with that.
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
[Chuckling] That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
I-I'll write you a check right now if you want.
But... that's not why you're here.
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
-Have you told the colonel;
"-No, I can't face him."
"I've gone that one time over, bringing him bad news."
Are you coming;
No.
"Then I'm finished, Brock, as far as you're concerned."
Too much for me.
One last word.
"I advise you to get in town, fast."
"Sarah Beth, tell your father I couldn't wait."
You can get out of this yourself or the way you got out of jail.
"What did Mr. McCurtin mean, the way you got out;"
"-He got you out, didn't he;"
-No.
-Who did;
-Chamberlain.
I guess he figures the young and foolish should have another chance.
"All right, Brock, you don't have to cover up with me."
I've known for a long time.
-When;
-For sure when I was 15.
-How;
-A lot of things put together.
"And before I went back to school the last time I knew you knew it, and I knew Papa did."
I could kill Chamberlain.
That's what the trouble was about.
"This fellow I was gambling with, he said a few things."
That's why I couldn't tell the colonel.
I couldn't let him know that I know.
"Oh, Brock."
"We've been around a lot together, the colonel and me and he never let anybody even think anything once, at least not out loud."
"Oh, don't I know."
Monorail!
t's so much cooler  to be in a band than be by yourself.
Just simply because you've always got people to have a laugh with people to share your experience with.
"-Morning, everyone."
-Good morning!
"Guys, gonna quickly run through the day with you just so you know what's going on."
he way our life is moving at the moment there's no way I'd be able to do this solo.
I can't imagine being in a hotel room on my own.
'd be bored to death.
e know that we've got a schedule to get through but we always think to have a laugh as we're doing it.
Do it.
hat's what mak es these trips a lot easier.
Zip!
Okay.
Watch this.
"This is what we came here for, Tommo."
Right.
"-Do I have to drink it now, is all?"
-Do it.
-There we have it.
-Just try to--
"-"" little Things."" little taste."
"-Yeah, Iet's run "" little Things."""
e rarely get lik e a day off when we land in places so it's just nice to walk around and explore.
"Stupid enough of me, I didn't know it got that cold here."
Thought it wouId be one of those countries that's always hot.
Why?
I don't know.
Because I just pictured australia.
"It's quite near, isn't it?"
"Man, tell me...."
"Oh, no."
Baby's gotta be with his mother.
How old is he?
Eight months on Friday.
I'm gonna give him a birthday present.
# Happy birthday to you ##
Hey.
Hey.
What's this I hear about a baby being back here?
Don't look at me.
Noogie's out of town.
"Mr. Nello, it's just for tonight."
Please?
I couldn't find a babysitter.
"Look, you've got 15 minutes to find one... and be back here in a tutu and on the floor."
Cut her some slack.
What the hell are you doing here?
Babysitting.
"for those of you who don't follow the Nobel Prize, I'm Morty Price."
"But seriously, I would like to thank right now..."
Mr. Cannata and Mr. Doss for bringing me back to glorious Miami.
"In fact, I was so eager to come, I turned down a chance... to be an extra in Coma Part II."
Not bad.
What?
"Not great, but not bad."
You ought to bottle his jokes and sell them for sleeping pills.
"I know it's hard to believe, I used to work in the stock exchange... till one of the brokers told me when my IQ hit 20, I should sell."
I really appreciate you helping me out.
This job is really important to me right now.
Better cover those.
You got husband troubles?
Not anymore.
I left him.
Play you?
That's right.
You win-- I tell you everything I know.
What's to stop me taking that basketball and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
They got better food at the hospital anyway.
"What the hell you got to threaten me with, man?"
- More lockup time?
- Okay.
We might be able to help you.
Shave some time off your sentence?
"I'm doing double life, gimp."
Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear, too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
"You could shave 10 years off my time, but I ain't never getting out."
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
I got all the time in the world.
What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball."
"It's not like we got a killer to catch, or anything."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is-is bad."
"Danno, shut up, all right?"
"Please, do me a favor and don't call me Danno, huh?"
"Lil, I feel like maybe you're trying a little too hard to keep your mind off Neal."
"Oh, pft, don't be ridiculous."
I'm completely fine.
Should I get braces?
"Honestly, I saw an infomercial, it really got me thinking."
"Oh, my God, it's Neal."
"He's on his way, he wants to pick up his key."
I don't want to see him.
We've gotta get out of here.
"I've got to go, grab my uggs!"
"Lil, Lil, stop, stop, stop."
"Look, I know this sucks."
But you can't just run from this.
Or drink from this.
"Or yoga from this, or invisalign from this."
I'm not.
I'm just keeping busy.
And taking advantage of my groupons.
"Come on, Lil."
I see what you're doing.
You don't want to be alone in this apartment.
"You're attached at the hip with a best friend, you're trying to drink away the pain of a breakup,"
"I mean, you're not dealing with reality."
How do you know?
Because I'm doing it too.
"Only, in my case it's even sadder, because I have not changed my underwear in three days."
"Yeah, you're right, I have to deal."
"I've got to cancel all the wedding stuff, and find a new place."
Can I live with you?
"Wow, that's aggressive."
"But, uh, yeah."
"Will you, please?"
"Can I help you?"""
"That means, ""Please don't rob me."""
And the guy will be the nicest dude ever.
"He's like, ""Well, actually, my name's Jamal."""
"""I just graduated from Harvard,"
"""and I can't wait to start the IT program, 'cause I really feel I can be a valuable asset to the team."""
"""Okay, Jamal."
"""Well, I'm gonna go call up Karen and see if she knows anything about this."""
There's always a Karen.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was in the middle of a bit."
Hold up.
"""Hey!"""
How you gonna control a child named Blue Ivy?
"She's sitting there pitching a fit, and Jay-Z looking all helpless."
He just...
"""Oh, oh."
"""Yo."
"""Hey, yo, Blue, you really need to calm down, you know?"
"""'Cause I'm really starting to get irritated, you know?"
"Jeah."""
¶ All I'm saying is I'm your daddy ¶
¶ You my little baby goi-rl.
"""Jeah."""
¶ But you don't want me to go and get that belt ¶
¶ 'Cause if I do both of your ass cheeks will melt ¶
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."""
"Shoot, Blue Ivy gonna look her dad dead in the face and be just like this here."
"""Do you hear what you named me?"
"Fuck you, Shawn."""
"""And since you wanna name me weird stuff,"
"""I'm gonna go sleep with Chris Brown and R. Kelly."
"How you like that?"""
I will not go down that way.
I choose to fight back!
"I choose to rise, not fall."
"I choose to live, not die."
And I know I know that what's within me is also within you.
That's why I ask you now to join me.
Join me.
Rise up with me.
Rise up on the wings of this slain angel.
We'll rebuild on the soul of this little warrior.
We will pick up his standard and raise it high.
Carry it forward until this city your city our city his city is a palace again!
Is a palace again!
"I am with you, little James."
I am you.
Thank you very much.
Terrible thing to bury a child.
Your trip to Washington.
The stuff for the Convention Committee.
History of New York City for Senator Marquand.
Reservation at the Willard Hotel.
"Lincoln stayed there, by the way."
Enough about me.
Enough about me.
What are you going do tonight after I'm gone?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.
You're going to get yourself a good meal.
You're going to pass up that double cheeseburger from Roy Rogers.
"You're going to go to Dominic's and get take-out, on me."
Get a decent meal.
"But before you go to Dominic's, go to Macy's and get a chair with legs and arms."
"So you neglect him most of his life, I'm out of the house a week, and there you are?"
"He surprised me, Dan."
"You know, Nathan's a good kid."
You got him so screwed up he doesn't know what he wants.
"Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?"
Deb's the best thing Nathan's got going for him right now.
- She's trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I'm trying to do?
"I've been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny."
"I don't mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring, but leave the good one alone, would you?"
Hey Peyton.
Missing these?
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with.
She was shaking them like a pom pom.
Maybe she'll be a cheerleader.
Or President.
You gotta think big.
"Alright, you never know."
Whatever makes her happy.
"You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are."
"Well, its really not that hard."
"I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked."
She's just so cute.
And I think about watching her grow up.
I couldn't imagine not being there.
"You know, I bet you're a really great dad."
I don't know.
Some days I wonder.
Hey Nathan.
Hey.
Missed you at practice.
"- Well, I mean..."
"- Oh, I think that's Amy."
- Where?
"Jesus Christ, I'm in the back seat and I can fucking see her."
"Oh, right there."
"Okay, fine."
- Congressman.
"- Oh, wow."
"Well, this is freaky."
"Look, I'm not hiding, just so you know."
"Okay, Congressman, time to exit through the gift shop."
"Okay, sir, you're gonna have to come with us."
"Guys, my mom is too ill to be left alone right now."
"I mean, I left her alone right now because she likes to read."
But she can't read right now because she's very sick.
But she might get better.
Or she might not get better.
- She could be buried with a book.
- We know she's not dying.
"- She's a fighter, is the thing."
- Good for her.
"As weird as it feels to still be saying this, the president would like to see you at the White House."
I feel like I'm about to kick it old school and die in office.
Quitting on a high.
Do you think I'm doing the right thing here?
"I mean, this is a good bill."
"Even watered down, I think it's gonna make a difference in people's lives."
"Ma'am, you're the president."
It's not for me to tell you what to do.
Yeah.
Guess I should kill it.
Is the right answer.
- I know.
-
- Good.
But you'r e secr etly in love with Casey.
[ Telephone ringing ]
What do you need?
"This will sound ridiculous, but I actually need a staple r emover."
Leave me alone.
Hey.
"Hi, there."
"Listen, you have every right to be mad, but bef or e you say anything, can I just speak?"
Sur e.
Her e's the thing --
"I did tell Natalie that I liked you when I met you in the elevator, and I did tell Natalie that I was gonna call you, but then, like a day later, I went out on a date with this woman named Elaine,"
"and then I went out on another date with her, and it's gotten a little serious, which is why I never called you."
"But I wanted to come up her e and tell you that personally, first of all 'cause I thought it was the menschy thing to do, and second of all because I r eally did like you when I met you in the elevator."
Now you should f eel f r ee to yell at me.
Who the hell ar e you?
It's me.

- Is this a joke?
-
- No.

- It isn't?

- No.
I'm not that good with jokes.
You don't have to be good with jokes.
This isn't a joke.

"Looks like we're clear for now, but we can't stay here too long."
Sam.
"Michael, give him a minute."
"Okay, so, those fake I.D.s..."
Worthless.
Wonderful.
Got another I.D. guy?
None that I trust -- not now.
There's a passport office up in Boca.
We could try to break in --
"Mike, come on."
"That's a crappy idea, and you know it."
Riley's gonna be expecting us to do exactly that.
"Now, I think I know a guy -- he's a friend of Dixon's, but..."
"It's a long shot, so if anybody else has a better idea, let's hear it."
"Okay, then."
"Even if you evade the FBI, ATF, and DEA, a life of crime is tough to explain to the IRS."
That's why many career criminals have a day job.
"It gives them a cover I.D., access to equipment, and a real W-2."
It also makes them easier to find if they won't answer your calls.
"Hey, buddy."
"Aw, Sam!"
What are you doing here?
"Good to see you, too, buddy."
This is my work!
And I'm not your buddy.
"Oh, come on, Dixon."
After all we've been through?
Didn't I get you a cargo plane last time I saw you?
"Oh, yeah."
That was easy to sell.
"I just put it on Craigslist and said, ""ignore the bullet holes."""
"You and your partner were having a beer, trying to unwind, and this jackass..."
"Uh, Joe Penn comes over and starts mouthing off."
"Maybe it was about the Cubs, maybe it was about Chicago's new mayor, I don't know."
"But this Joe Penn crossed a line somehow, and you felt you needed to step in and deal with it."
Or not.
"If I'm anywhere close, just grunt."
Read my report.
"Lee says he and Taggot had been there about an hour, had a couple of beers, were about to leave when this Joe Penn got into a fight with another patron."
He and Taggot stepped in to break it up.
How'd you do?
"Yeah, that's pretty much what Taggot said."
"Hey, Sis."
I'll just be a minute.
"Donny, Steve."
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be out busting bad guys?
The shift doesn't start till 11:00.
"Yeah, but this isn't your station."
Why are you acting weirder than usual?
- I'm not.
"- Yes, you are."
"- Yeah, you really are."
- Way beyond your normal weird.
"Well, I'm just surprised to see you guys here, that's all."
So why are you here?
To wish Sean Dunn good luck.
We talked about this last night.
It's his last day.
He's moving to Tampa.
Is any of this ringing a bell for you?
Right.
- Mm-hmm.
That's actually pretty impressive.
I'm gonna have to borrow this when you're done.

I'm here to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Po-Po.

Hello.
"Uh, would you describe yourself as ""cat competent?"""
"Oh, yes."
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
I'm joking.
"I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned--"
"The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
"Jenna, that's my friend Jenna."
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
"I'm not missing them, they're just not there."

That's a great job.

The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
"Everyone has someone except for me, you know?"
"Okay, well, I thought you weren't ready for that."
"Well, I wasn't, but I..."
I don't know.
- Maybe I am.
"- Well, if we had to verbally abuse some game night guests for you to figure that out, then that is totally okay."
"And, just so you know, if you wanna get out there, all I have to do is put out an APB."
- Let me handle this one.
- I'll probably get involved.
Why don't you get involved with Mark's peen.
"No, 'cause guess what?"
"This is 40, okay?"
"Do you really think, when you take your clothes off, that he's gonna run the other way?"
"No, he's gonna jump on you like an old hound dog."

You will again.

"Oh, Darrin, I haven't heard you talk this way before."
Remember the new account I told you about?
Waterhouse and Company?
The one the agency's been trying to get for years?
Yes.
"Oh, don't tell me you lost it."
"No, we got it all right."
"The trouble is, I will not be handling it."
"Well, did you talk to Larry?"
Larry's the one who told me about it.
"Well, I know how you feel."
But maybe...
"Well, maybe you're just in too much of a hurry to get to the top."
"Remember, you're still young."
"I'm young all right, but I won't always be young."
"If that's Larry, tell him I'm on my way."
Hello.
"Oh, hi, Louise."
"Yeah, sure I'd like to hear some good news."
Larry told you wh...
Darrin's got the Waterhouse account?
"Oh, I can't wait to tell him."
"Oh, well, all right."
"If Larry wants to tell him himself, I understand."
"- Well, thank you for your time."
- You're leaving and she's coming?
I don't think she came to talk to me.
- I didn't expect her to come today.
- Me neither.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
He had to hurry to the bank.
- Hi.
Good to see you.
"- Hi, Anna."
I didn't think you were coming today.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why haven't you told me yourself?
Why do you keep lying to me?
"Sorry, Anna..."
I didn't want to make you sad.
Did you think I wouldn't be sad if you just died one day?
- No...
- What?
I didn't want you to see me as a dead man before I was.
I wanted us to be together as much as possible before anyone knew.
"If I knew you were dying, I wouldn't spend my time doing other stuff."
And I want you to tell me these things.
I want you to tell me.
"Anna, you mustn't cry now."
"It will hurt   but it will pass, just like everything else."
And now Jacob will be with you.
I don't care about Jacob.
You're my father and you didn't tell me you're dying.
I don't want anyone but you.
"If you don't tell me you're dying, I can't say the things I want to say."
"Oh,yeah,I am,but Petty's not."
Stay there.He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me,do not move."
Petty.
- You know me?
- A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well,transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
"Drop the knife.Get on the ground,face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know,it's what,2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible,and I'Il tell you anything you want to know."
"it gives me pause, Lutie, to see him."
There's such a lot of recklessness under that crazy charm.
There's a danger in him and a kind of violence.
it's hard for me to keep my hands off.
"Sometimes, when he looks at me as we pass and it's never more than a flick of his eye i feel that he must know something and that he must hate me for it."
i understand Sarah Beth graduated last week with high honors.
Sarah Beth Brewton.
Hazel Sawyer.
BRlCE:
They tell me she'ii be home soon.
"i wonder how Sait Fork will seem to her now, after her years of schooling."
BROCK:
"Pardon me, ma'am."
"I'm, uh, looking for a little sawed-off, freckled, ugly runt of a girl."
I'm looking for a handsome young gentleman.
"Well, you found what you're looking for, but how about me;"
You went and changed on us.
"-Oh, Brock."
"-Hello, Sarah Beth."
Where's Papa;
Papa.
Papa.
"Good to see you, Sarah Beth."
"Oh, I might've known you'd be like this, both of you."
-Like what;
"-Oh, good-looking."
"A couple of years do a lot for a young lady, don't they;"
"Well, what did you expect;"
"Of me, I mean."
"Not as much as we got, eh, Brock;"
"Not half. I don't know, though, looks stuck up to me."
-Probably won't like our town anymore.
I didn't think I would care.
"You know, I had a plan."
I wasn't even gonna look at him.
"And when I realized he wasn't coming at all,"
I just got this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.
He doesn't even want to see me.
Ugh!
I just hate that he can make me feel like that.
I know.
That's the worst.
At least when my birth mom balls
"I can tell myself it's 'cause she's a drug addict, right?"
Jealous.
Don't hate.
"I did kinda want to see him, though."
Just once.
Just to know.
"Hey, uh, do you have any plans tonight?"
"Um... no, why?"
Why do you care?
Are you so shallow that you're afraid your social status will be diminished by a big brother who doesn't
Yes.
"No, but really, Jesus and Emma are going to some all-ages show tonight at the Groundspace to see this band that Emma's friend is in."
"Now, Callie wants to come, but because Wyatt's out of town,"
I'm going with her so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
- So why do you need me?
- We need a ride.
I feel so loved.
Um...
"I don't know, why don't you ride with Emma?"
"We're trying not to be third and fourth wheels, remember?"
- You have to come.
I don't have to think.
We didn't say anything to anybody.
Not a word.
Not until we hit this barracks.
What are you looking at me for?
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
I suppose some jerk's gonna say I did it.
Why don't you try it one at a time?
"Now, there's a lot of folks around these days that don't believe in Santa Claus."
I always did and I always will.
"For a while, I thought the Luftwaffe had shot him down reindeer, sleigh and all."
"But no, sir."
Come the day before Christmas the Geneva man showed up with some presents for us.
"They brought us coffee, a little sugar, prunes and toothbrushes."
"And of all things, some Ping-Pong balls."
There must have been a slip-up someplace because suddenly we wound up with 2000 Ping-Pong balls.
"It seemed pretty idiotic at the time but as it turned out, those Ping-Pong balls sure came in handy."
"Oh, mother, did they come in handy!"
"Hey, Schulz."
What is this?
You must get out of your bunk.
The Geneva man is coming to inspect the--
Du lieber Gott!
How do you look.
You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor.
Maybe I can--
- Silk stockings.
"-Good evening, Mrs. Bourne."
"Horace, you're looking very handsome tonight."
And so are you.
"-My, that's a beautiful gown."
-Brandon chose it.
"They're always much gayer when Brandon chooses them, Jessie."
"Nora Kernan, Horace and I don't come here every Thursday night just to talk women talk."
Suppose we discuss dinner for awhile?
"Oh, Brandon, before I forget, Frank Belney called a few minutes ago."
He wants you to meet him at your club at 10:00.
"-Oh, no."
"-I'm sorry, Jess."
Frank's meeting his stockholders tomorrow.
He must be getting nervous.
Could you answer one simple question just to cheer me up?
Yes.
We are having corned beef and cabbage.
-Dinner is served.
-On the dot.
Check.
"Dear, I don't know if it's possible, but I feel that you're cheating."
"When you can prove it, I'll be glad to discuss it with you."
Jessie looks wonderful tonight.
"She has you to thank for her looks, darling."
And you.
"When a woman gets more beautiful after she's married, it means her man is either making her very happy, or very unhappy."
-Oscar Wilde?
"-No, Belasco."
"Horace, you're really very good with that one step of yours."
You do so much with it.
"Well, I've been polishing it for 40 years."
"Nora, remember when you taught me to dance, backstage at the New Amsterdam?"
Sensei!
Brother!
He said that ballerinas should dance until they die.
He said that they should dance as long as they have legs.
I'm going to dance.
I'm not going to let myself be defeated like my mother.
"After hearing Kayama-sensei, I know what I need to do."
It's been a long time.
I lived alone with Yagi.
I danced alone.
I pursued you all by myself.
"Now, I just want to be alone in the dark."
I want to do things on my own.
"You know, I was thinking that I wanted to see you not as an old friend, but as someone new."
I don't like that.
"If you were to pass me by now, you wouldn't even notice me."
Do you think so?
I'm going to go to Kansai soon.
Will you come with me?
We can decide our fates on that trip.
Shinako has a performance.
I want to see that.
After that.
That's fine.
"I'll go see it, too."
"Father, I brought you some iced tea."
Thank you.
What's Takao doing?
He isn't home yet.
"Yesterday I said some things I shouldn't have to your mother, didn't I."
It wasn't nice of me to say such terrible things.
"As your mother says, it might be true that your mother's unhappiness is a result of my behaviour."
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you know what?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now I can stay with you until you awake, my love."
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU I knew she hadn't."
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
- How come?
- I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
"No, Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now."
"If he wants to get off the island, the first thing he needs to do is change his appearance."
Coming in?
It's the men's room.
"It's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid-- you can go anywhere."
Lemonade mixed in mayo.
It's an old prison trick for dyeing hair.
Seriously?
Looks like our man's a blonde now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
15 minutes ago.
"Factor in the time for a dye job, he couldn't have made it very far."
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"Excuse me, sir."
Every time I come across...
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
"From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,"
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
"I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot."
"I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream."
I'll decide where it goes from here.
If you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
"Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat."
There's only one way across.
"Lost my muchness, have I?"
Bayard!
The hat!
Your Majesty.
¶ Me and Fred gonna stick together ¶
'Cause I ain't a punk.

"Hell, yeah."
That's why I can't smoke weed.
Weed is dangerous for somebody like me.
I already got too many voices in my head.

I was driving around looking for my car keys.
Just stopping people in my neighborhood.

"""No, for real."

"It was so bad, I was in my hotel room in the bathroom mirror having an in-depth conversation with myself about why I should keep my voice down."
"Because the walls were thin, and the next-door neighbors was gonna think I was crazy."
So I'm in my hotel room looking and sounding like Sméagol from Lord of the Rings.
"Thank you, Miss ""I'm in love with Dylan the spy."""
Wait.
"I'm confused, because the papers are right here."
They've been switched.
How do you know that?
They're in Russian.
Because I speak Russian.
"Sure, Jerry."
Ask me to say something.
"Okay, um..."
"Say, ""I've been lying to my sister about speaking Russian."""

And you wonder why I don't trust you.

"I swear to God, sometimes I feel like I know you better than anyone else on the planet, and then there's other times that I--I feel like I don't even know you at all!"
I'm sorry--
Why would you keep something like that from me?
Because I wanted to protect you.
I've done some things I'm not especially proud of over the last five years.
Like what?
There was a time I was running from arms dealers in Tunisia.
"I didn't have a weapon, and they were chasing me, so I-- You know what?"
Stop.
"You're right, I don't want to hear this right now."
I'm sorry about the papers.
It's all right.
I'm just glad that you're okay.
[sighing] Great.
Angela.
Yes.
There are things you don't know about me.
"But seriously, there is no question you are the closest person to me on the planet."
- What do we have here?
- A broken statue.
- probably with that rock.
- By the young guy.
The lady saw him and went out with the gun.
He took it and...
Let's see what they say.
Why did he break the statue?
It can't be easy... seeing a statue of...
What?
"I don't know, just imagine..."
"You're in Africa, and you see a statue of a... a white guy in a Canadians sweater, fishing with a hockey stick, an Expos cap, a red belt, and a six-pack, while you're at it."
Why do you laugh?
That's exactly it.
"Take a hot head, he sees this and goes for it."
- You're right.
- obviously.
"obviously, the old lady was scared enough to get her gun."
What is it?
"I know you, you got an idea."
"If it had been a white guy, maybe she would've run out screaming, with a broom..."
"but here, she saw a black guy."
- She took a gun.
- She was scared of him.
"She saw him, got a gun, went out."
Jacques... did you ever wonder where it comes from... being uneasy around black people?
We're even scared of them.
Think about it.
"We copy Americans, and they don't like them much."
"I don't know, there must be a reason."
"It comes from, listen to this, from prehistoric times."
- It's true.
[laughs]
"She skipped lunch, so."
Why don't we get you two a drink?
- Great.
- Yeah.
"Tawny, come, please."
"Good night, girls."
[kisses] Bye.
"I'll see you later, okay?"
"[Arnie] You know, I'm thinking of trying out for the Washington Generals."
"You know, the basketball team that's always losing to the Harlem Globetrotters?"
"Hey, why can't white people win once in a while, right?"
"I know what you're thinking, ""Arnie, you're too small."
"Arnie, you're pathetic at basketball."
"Arnie, you're too white."""
"No, those are the requirements to play for the Washington Generals."

It's not like that was the first alcohol I've tasted in my life.
"Anyway, I have no choice but to take responsibility."
"Because you're a student, Kang Kyung Joon."
"Also,"
I'm sorry that you have no choice but to pretend to be my fiancé.
I want to thank you too.
"You don't have to apologize, since you found this for me."
"And if you're thankful, fill this up please."
I have to pay more getting on the bus with this face.
And my clothes!
Do something about it!
"If I stretch a little, it seems like it's going to burst!"
My pants are always riding up like this!
"Yeah, I don't think we can leave his body like this."
Let's go.
To buy new clothes?
I see you've drawn a tree.
Do you think you're a tree?
"Heh, heh."
- At least I didn't draw a knife.
- What knife?
This knife.
"Oh, you're gonna get your meds upped for that."
You should not be drawing knives in art therapy.
- All right.
"- Ha, ha."
Don't.
Oh!
It's almost like an outside force is guiding me.
Stop it.
Nice work.
- You ruined mine.
- Sorry.
"When my little sister was 8, her appendix burst and she was in the hospital for like a week."
And she was scared of everything.
"The doctors, the needles, the, um, weird plastic kidney-shaped thing that she had to pee in."
Um...
So I made my mom take me to the hospital every day.
And I sat by her bed and I painted her nails and we made fun of the nurses together and...
"I didn't really think I was doing anything that spectacular, you know, because I thought of course I would do that."
She would do the same thing for me.
"But the thing is, um, she hasn't come here to visit me."
Not even once.
I'm glad they don't come.
I don't want anyone to see me in here.
"It just makes me sad, that's all."
"Before we end, I just wanted to mention that this is Bruce's last session."
He'll be leaving tomorrow.
"I drive by your place, I call and hang up."
I'm turning into...
Me.
Yeah.
"A wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen, no matter what."
That's true.
But when I was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to make it happen.
"Yeah, all right."
Here's the thing about that:
You were right.
I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women and having the power that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually fell for one of them.
I didn't know.
"Look, I just went out with your friend Bill and..."
Yeah.
He might be just exactly what I need.
No drama.
"He calls, he does what he says."
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.
And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.
That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.
That I have to stop thinking that...
I'm the exception.
You are my exception.

"Hi, it's Mary at the Blade."
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.
Really?
You don't think the muscle T is too much?
I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.
"What, you here?"
How long have you been working on these?
About a year.
Can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
I can... but I'm not going to.
But you just said they were good.
"So is ""The Hulk,"" but I don't have to like it."
"Your drawings are technically fine, but it just shows that you can copy well, and they've got no soul."
"I've known you for two years, we've had a hundred conversations-- about comics."
"You are a passionate dude with deep ideas, so I'm looking at this and thinking, ""ls this all you've got to say?"""
Aliens from Jupiter want to enslave the women of the Earth?
Yep!
You dumb motheftucker.
"Cans go in the blue, green is for paper."
- What's going on?
- I ain't touching those hands.
How did it go this morning?
"David totally dug my shit, man."
He might send something over to Gotham Comics.
That's excellent.
Check it out.
It's the Brunswick Monster.
- How much did you pay for that?
- What does it matter?
I predict this ball is gonna add 15 points to my game.
Friend:
Now all I got to do is get to Vegas.
Vegas?
"The Amateur World Classic is next month, it costs 3,000 to enter, but get this... the purse is a hundred grand."
"I don't know, Mick..."
three grand?
Aw...
"Gracias, mi amor."
I'm having a baby with a woman that I'm very much in love with.
"You told me that you were confused, that you wanted to leave her."
I know.
"I was confused, Kim."
I was so confused.
And it was wrong of me to get you tangled up in that.
How could you not tell me that you were having a baby?
Because I'm an asshole.
I did a bad thing.
I have no excuse.
"There nothing I can say to you other than that I'm so sorry, and it's really not about you at all."
Why do people always say that?
"How can it not be about me if you can sleep with me one minute, and then walk out on me the next?"
"I'm sorry, Kim."
I gotta go.
- All right.
- All right.
"No, you'll be fine."
You are the suckiest driver.
No way.
I'm not.
"Well, how many miles do you think you guys will be making fun of me for?"
I'd say pretty much the whole entire way.
I'm not going to make fun of you.
I think there's a bus stop...
- Is there a bus down there?
"Oh, good."
- It's four miles.
"Because my friends aren't giving me a ride home, so..."
I think it's going to rain.
"Sorry I'm not coming, guys."
"- No, don't apologize."
"Oh, Becky is scaring me."
"For the love of god, go for it!"
You idiot!
Watch where you're putting your oversized scalextric.

"Hi, I'm Jenny pope."
I'm here to interview for the practice manager's post.
"If you'd just like to take a seat, Mary will see you at 9:05."
"Hello, I'm Mary."
I'll be looking after you this morning.
If you'd just like to follow me I'll take you to meet the doctor.
Are there many other candidates?
"Oh, just one."
"Doctor, this is Jenny Pope, is it?"
"Jenny, meet Dr. Blair."
Hello.
"We've already met, actually."
"Oh, yeah, the *** lady"
"Yeah, that was very much my sense of humor on display."
***
It's just silly.
As you come to learn I'm pretty quick on the draw when it comes to banter.
"I'm a social beast- who knows where to draw the line, hard working, but very pleasant."
Right.
Take a seat.
"This is Karen from the PCT, she is going to be doing... *** testing and role plays."
"Yeah, thanks, Mary."
"And there will be an interview, and then at the end of the day"
I'll decide who's going to be taking over from the late great Valery.
"Well, if you're ready, doctor, I think we should begin."
"I've taught my cub all that I can, and now it's time for him to go out and maul some tourists on his own."
You know what?
I'll get you a glass of water.
"Ooh, hey, hey."
And a Pop Tart?
"Oh, well, if you want a Pop Tart,"
I do not have to go downstairs.
You have a problem.
"Hey, buddy."
"Oh, thank God it's you, man."
I was so scared to come out of my room.
But I really needed a drink of water.
I almost let Clementine get it for me.
Clementine's in your room?
N-No.
"All right, look, this is crazy."
You got your mom right where you want her right now.
You need to take advantage of it.
- What do you mean?
"- What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but your mom wouldn't let you do?"
Go to Tijuana.
Then you go to Tijuana right now!
How can she possibly say no when she won't even look you in the eye?
You really think she would let me go to Tijuana just to avoid talking to me?
Only one way to find out.
- (chuckles)
- Look.
I also want to clarify one thing
- about that text.
"- No, no, no, please..."
"I would be doing those things to your mother, and not the other way around, because... no, look at me."
You got to look at me.
He studied in New York when he was young.
"And Yoon Sang Min is a Korean American, from New York."
"Although, I'm sure there are countless Koreans in New York..."
"And the man taking orders from all of them, our killer."
"And, working under Park Seon Woo, the suspects of our current murder case."
The two unknowns.
"If our predictions are right, and Chief Jung is Park Seon Woo's boss..."
It's good to look at this from different angles.
"If we catch these two guys, as well as Park Seon Woo..."
"We could knock them off balance, and get them all at once."
You could have came home to change.
Why did you ask me to bring you clothes?
Your lips are chapped too...
- I might have to work overnight.
- What case is it?
And your clothes...
Whose blood is this?
Hey!
Why are you staring at us like that from over there?
It's making me angry.
- Are you monitoring him right now?
"- No, no, we're not."
They just wanted to say hello.
"- Hey, say hello one more time."
"- Yes, hello."
I'm pretty quick with my wits.
"Something is... not going well, right?"
This is all...
because of that Park Seon Woo.
Park Seon Woo?
"I knew I had to watch out, but I didn't know he would come at me so fiercely."
- What's going on between you two?
It's Jimmy.
We've only got a few moments until they run into they're onto us again.
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here it is.
Here it is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Toodle-oo.

Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
Slick handles all Akan's cops/guns/ real estate/ a lot of other shit.
This helpful dot on the map... is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there... kill him... open up his ribcage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
I'm kidding.
You don't have to fucking eat his heart.
"Under his heart is his charge pump, yeah?"
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.
That has gotta be the gayest jacket I've ever seen.

Henry.
Akan's already started.
"If we don't stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
"I can tell you something very important, about the man who sent you here."
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high-class establishment.
Follow the dot and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
You got an ash tray?
Was she heavy?
Was it hard for them to get her into the dumpster?
"One guy lifted her, the other guy held the top open."
- You see his face?
- Whose face?
You told the other officer you saw the killers face.
I did?
"No, I didn't."
You calling this officer a liar?
I didn't see faces.
I seen the license plate.
"258, right?"
287.
I didn't see the rest of it.
What's the last line on that poster?
"I, I..."
I don't have my glasses.
I was wearing my glasses.
"Y'know, a doctor says to me that I gotta wear my glasses all the time, and, I have to admit, I am sorta vain."
"Well, put your glasses on... and read the bottom line on that poster."
I don't have 'em with me.
"Tell me about the gloves, what were they like?"
"They're white, cotton."
"They got stitching on the back of the hand, along the knuckle."
They're proper ladies gloves.
You can see that kinda detail from your car without your glasses?
I had my glasses.
"When the two guys went away, I got out and took a closer look."
"Frank, your wife's on the phone."
"Stan just radioed in from Pamela's apartment, only the name on the lease is JMJ Wilgis."
"JMJ, a brother, sister?"
Yes.
Oooh!

"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
You want me to start buying?
At 72?
I should say not.
I've passed the word that i'm not gonna buy until the price goes down.
In a few days it'll be a flat as a flounder.
The board of directors of the erie railroad wish to announce that they have declared a dividend on all outstanding stock of 50%.
Whoever heard of a 50% dividend?
"Nobody, but it makes erie the best buy on the market."
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
50%!
I smell a rat.
A little bald-headed one with chin whiskers.
73!
73!
You don't know how lucky you are.
His brains is gonna pull you through.
I didn't think drew was smart enough to find a new way to start a bull rush.
But i'm gonna fight him.
Go ahead and buy.
But it's a false price!
"False as wooden teeth, but the suckers are falling for it, and the only way to beat drew is to get control."
"No matter what it costs, i can make the railroad worth it when i'm boss."
"But commodore, i don't think- go ahead, buy."
"While we've been gabbing here, it's gone up 3 points."
Vanderbilt's buying.
Vanderbilt's buying.

"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, it's- It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, that's"
- That's bad.
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, look at"
- Look at this.
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
"I mean, just drink all your water you can get inside yourself."
"You know, just lots and lots of water."
"That way it'll fill up your stomach, and you won't get hungry."
- I'll fight the guy that says you can't.
- I hope they think that way up front.
Forget it.
You're a cinch.
- You sure you're rooting for the right guy?
- Sure.
Think it over.
"I'm warning you there ain't gonna be no hangovers in no shop I'm boss of, get it?"
"- Okay, Mr. Taylor."
- Oh.
"Starting to red apple the boss already, huh?"
"Well, come on, we'll give them a week's work between now and quitting time."
Sure that will do you?
"Oh, yes, thanks."
I'll return it first thing in the morning.
"Even if you don't, it's all right."
I still owe you four eggs and that half bottle of bluing I got from you.
"- Oh, gee, Betty, that looks swell."
- I hope it tastes all right.
The men are getting hard to please.
Not your pa.
He eats anything.
I trained him like that.
"You know, you gotta train a man just like you would a dog."
So it's Ed Jackson who's hard to please.
Are you going to start that again?
"Yes, I am."
And I'm going to keep it up until you and Ed do something about it.
- What are you waiting for?
- That's what I keep telling her.
I guess it's polite to wait until you're asked.
Don't be silly.
"""Athletic""?"
"Sideburns, no cans."
She is hot.
"So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in.
In six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
Twenty.
And a half.
Almost.

- Yeah.
She's roller skating there.
I don't know which is more pathetic-- that you're going out with a 20-year-old or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out catching up on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping, Oh."
and she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."

She said she stopped by because you didn't pack your sweater.

I showed her where the luggage was in the office.
I said all right.
Thank--

I didn't mean to disturb you.
But I suppose I didn't kiss you goodbye this morning.

"Sandy, you're upset about something."
You know you are.
"You didn't eat your breakfast this morning and last night you talked in your sleep again about waterskiing, of all things."
Please leave me alone.

You can save your breath.
You clearly put him up to that little stunt.
"Mrs M, you've got it all wrong."

He'd wanted to ask you out for lunch for a very long time.
"He seems a jolly decent chap, and I think he really likes you."
Was there anything else?
No.

But Joshua won his big fight against Vladimir Klitschko at Wembley.
"But the weird thing was, no-one seemed to know what the fight was about."
"Normally a girl, innit?"
"OK, all right."
"Fingers on buzzers, one more to go."
"OK, what do you think?"
David Beckham.
"David Beckham, what, you think he's very popular?"
"Well, everyone loves him."
He's getting more and more handsome by the day.
It's like a disease he's got.
"You've been cured, I see!"
Yeah...
"You knock 'em up, I'll hit it..."
I mean...
Aw.
You're a very handsome man.
"No-one's denying it, they're just reassuring you."
"Let's have a look at David Beckham talking about his tattoos, in this enlightening clip from 2000."
"What is this, David?"
It's a new tattoo I'm thinking about having.
I wanted a new tattoo for ages but I just couldn't... not think.
"I've known what I've wanted because I wanted something to do with Victoria, Victoria's name."
And I think it'd look...
"We've both agreed it'd look a bit tacky if I had ""Victoria"", just in English, down there."
So I've gone for Arabic.
Why?
Yes.
The joke.
"So, um..."
So there's this man.
"He rushes to the hospital, gets there, the doctor comes out, and he says, I'm so sorry."
"Wait, why is he rushing to the hospital?"
"Oh, his wife was in an accident."
Wait.
I thought I just said that.
So where was I?
Um...
"Oh right, she was in an accident, and the doctor says, uh..."
What kind of accident?
"Again, so, worst shape possible."
"She basically lost all of her limbs, so, the doctor says, you know, and she may not be able to recognize you ever, ever again, and the husband says, oh my gosh, this is terrible news."
"And the doctor says, by the way, she's dead."
"She's, she's dead."
"So a man hears that his wife's in a horrible accident, he rushes to the hospital."
"When he gets there, the doctor says, I'm so sorry, but the accident has left your wife blind, deaf, and mute, and she'll never be able to recognize you again."
"The guy's like, oh my God this is terrible news, and that's when the doctor says,"
I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
It's funnier.
30 seconds.
"Man, it's really our last one."
Ssh.
"Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up."
Shit.

How do you do?
"Well, all I can advise is don't get complacent."
- I won't.
"Asthma's a condition that can lie low for years, then out of the blue, something triggers an attack and then suddenly you're in trouble."
"Thanks for the all-clear, Doctor."
"Give my regards to your mother, David."
"- Will do, Mrs Campbell."
Thank you.
Have you given any more thought to what I've asked - about enlisting?
I just want to know whether or not they'd take me.
That's all.
"But if they say ""yes"", then that won't be all, will it?"
"Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash."
I just want to know my options.
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me wanting you to stay with us would be the only option you'd need.
The appointment's at 3:30.
I'll be back in time for evening surgery.
David's turning into a fine young man.
- Hmm.
I can't do this without him.
"Look, Dr. Roland, I need to reschedule."
I'll move my nail appointment to next Tuesday.
But I'm not ready to have a baby yet.
"Well, you should have thought of that before you got pregnant."
"Okay, did you somehow swallow my mother?"
"You'll stay with me, right?"
"I can count on you, at least, can't I?"
Absolutely.
"All right, Substitute Daddy, scrub up and get ready because I'm gonna need you to hold the baby as it comes out."
"Now, get a good grip, because it's gonna be kind of slimy."
I'm passing out.
What?
Passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
"God, this is going on forever, and I have to get there in time."
What's the longest it's ever taken for a baby to come out?
"Well, I heard about this one woman in the Himalayas who was in labor for a week."
Really?
Yeah.
She died.
"Oh, this is not a helpful story."
"No, it's not."
"God, I can't believe"
I didn't even have it together enough to be there for my own son's birth.
"I mean, my father was a son of a bitch, but he was there when I was born."
"God, Billie must think"
I'm the biggest loser on Earth right now.
You?
What about me?
I'm her sister.
You're always taking them away so you can wear them yourself.

"All I want for my birthday is Danny, and I'm going with him."
Now you stop this.
I hate you.
I hate you!
"If you try to stop me, Aunt Olivia, I'll kill you."
"You know, she just might do it."
"Hey, not bad."
What name did you register under?
Lenore Adams.
I hope that meets with your approval.
"Hey, now come on, come on."
This is the big night.
This is what we've been waiting for.
"21 candles, remember?"
I still think it's a dirty trick.
"That poor little nitwit has fallen in love with you, hasn't she?"
Next I suppose you'll say you want to marry her.
"If I married every girl that had eyes for me,"
I'd have them strung out from here to...
Anywhereland.
"Oh, yeah, you're quite a rocket."
"All right, how much do you think you're gonna get for the diamonds?"
"$50,000, easy."
Merle's worth a quarter of a million-- or she will be as soon as Uncle Howard decides she's old enough to handle it.
That's the way her trust is set up.
Did you know that?
"No, I didn't know that."
"And, uh...how do you know that?"
"I keep my ears open, too."
[whistles] A quarter of a million dollars.
"What'II happen?"""
No wallets!
It's so fuckin' tense.
"Like when you're in line with everybody and you're going through the zigzags, yeah, you're having the time of your life."
"The moment you touch a bin, you're in the Octagon."
Nobody's your buddy.
Nobody's your pal.
They're timing you.
"As soon as you touch a bin, go!"
"""That's as fast as you can go?"
How many bins do you need?
Laptop and an iPad?
"Where the fuck are you going?"""
Then you gotta go through that goddamn Stargate machine.
What is that?
Why do we just do it?
What is it?
"If you asked TSA, ""What does this even do?"""
"They're like, ""Well, shows us where your sweaty spots are, and then we tackle 'em."""
"Next time you're at the airport and you step into that Stargate machine, look at the person on the other side and be like,"
"""I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."""
"""Sir, please come out."""
"""Oh."
"How long was I gone?"""
"Do all that. ""Sir, you can step out."""
"""How long was I gone?"
"Where am I?"""
"""Very funny, sir."
"Please go, get on your flight."
"You, ma'am, with the baby formula, why are you here?"""
"""I think I was sent from the future to kill a boy."""
"""Sir, please, grab your bag."
I was sort of heard you on the phone.
I'm starting in the fall. uh i just transferred from b.u. scott.
I'm dan. nice to meet you scott.
- Maybe i'll£¬uh i'll see you around. - yeah.
We got this for you.
I'll take that. thank you.
What are you doing here?
What i should have done months ago.
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off
With the latest gossip girl blast.
She is nothing if not punctual. allow me.
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed
When she was trying to protect you nelly?
Well now the world knows them too.
So looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen?
Besides her dad is marrying lily bass£¬
So i think that makes her richer than all of you.
Not enough.
Okay so starting next year no more headbands
Except for this one.
- Thanks you can keep the change. - oh big spender.
Hey mom. it's really cool here.
Um i've already met some great people.
Yeah.
All right. all right. you were right about portland.
I think i'm gonna love it.
All right. yeah i--listen i gotta go all right?
- I'll--i'll call you soon. - well i'm done for the day.
"They're sexting, they're krumping, they're twatting each other 'cause their day's so special they have to share it with the world."
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!
"Look, Joey, we were single."
We had our fun.
We're not missing out on anything.
"No, you were single, you had fun."
"I got married early, so I never got to experience this."
I have a feeling you had a chance to experience lots of things.
"But, look, if you want to go play ""Guess Your Disease"""
"or ""Let Me Translate Your Tribal Tattoo,"" knock yourself out."
You don't get it.
I'm here trapped on an island with a woman who can't even stand the sight of me.
And whose fault is that?
It's not my fault!
"Dude, relationships are a two-way street, not a highway and a bike path."
"If it matters to you, work at it."
"And if it doesn't, then don't!"
But make a decision.
I want to be married 'cause I want to have people I can share my life with.
I don't wanna be doing this.
I know what I want.
I want it...
Look.
"Hey, Dave, it's not 'cause I don't want it, okay?"
You make the best of your situation!
My situation's to party!
Yeah!
"Yeah, definitely."
San Diego!
Remember me?
Where have you been?
"You see you don't understand, you're not a hobbyist."
Where is Nick?
I need to talk to him.
I myself wouldn't mind knowing where he's hiding.
But is he home?
Because I've got news.
"I know he is your husband, but my god!"
"What's your news, love?"
"I wanted to tell Nick first, but uhm..."
I'm pregnant.
"Jenny, love, that's fantastic!"
"Oh, my sweet, that's wonderful."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, the doctor found out while he was checking my urine for... for no reason."
I'm going to be a great-grandmother!
No!
"No, Mum, you're going to be a grandmother, you're still going to be a grandmother."
"Oh, even better."
Was it a surprise?
"Well, I have been feeling quite queasy in the mornings but..."
I put that down to other factors.
"Oh, that boy."
"I'll give him credit, hat's off, you know?"
He gets the job done.
Although you know with the extra mouth to feed and everything...
"Oh, its little mouth."
"We might not be able to move out straight away, we might need to stay a little bit longer if that's okay."
That's lovely.
"It's better than okay, poppet."
"It's better than okay, better than okay."
"I need to tell Nick, I can't wait any longer."
"Hi, hi Nick, it's me."
--------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
Can you believe this shit?
They started a Kickstarter account in my name called Justice For The Kyles.
"I'm not the Kyles, I'm just Kyle."
And I don't need justice.
I get it.
"I mean, you didn't sign up for this."
"If you weren't on the jury, you wouldn't have been downtown, you wouldn't have gotten jumped."
I got jumped because I'm a gay man in a world full of haters.
My mom and dad think I have a gay-bash target on my back.
They're worried any guy I meet at a bar is gonna jump me.
"You didn't meet him at the bar, you got jumped in the alley."
"Right, that's what I said."
That's what I meant.
Do you want something to drink?
"I got all these gift baskets, like fancy tequila and stuff."
What do you want?
What?
- Do you remember Sophia Russo?
She was one of the character witnesses at the trial.
"The cook at the mansion, right?"
Yeah.
I stopped by her house the other night.
"Oh, great."
How's she doing?
She's dead.
"The thing is, the last person to see her alive was a big white dude."
A really big white dude.
Wanna tell me what really happened?
"Here, tell you what."
"I'll take a stab at it, okay?"
You met him in the bar.
What is the matter with you?
What the fuck kind of people are they?
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.
But the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess party.
"-Karen, where you from?"
-Lawrence.
"Ah, yeah, Lawrence."
Out on the island.
That's nice.
I'm from Miami.
You ever been there?
"It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven."
Angie stop picking at that thing.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
He looks like a farmer...
I'm tellin' ya I can't get through the gate without this guys hands all over me.
"So I told him, ""Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."""
She means it.
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie--
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.
"Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard, then he'll be there for life."
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument.
A lousy $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off.
Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears finds out he's in jail she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
"If you have the information you want,"
I really don't see the point of this.
I spoke to your Sergeant yesterday about Mrs. Barr's last visit here.
With a different man.
Yes.
Obviously I was as shocked as anyone by news of Mrs. Barr's tragic death.
"Yes, I bet you were."
"I bet she was a good tipper, wasn't she?"
Did Mrs. Barr usually ask for a copy of the bill?
No.
But she did on this occasion.
Now Mrs. Barr's only slightly less disorganized than I am.
Why would she want a copy of the bill when she's already got the original?
"Mrs. Barr always settled the account herself, but on this occasion the gentleman did, cash."
"She asked me to give her a copy of the bill when they left that afternoon, without the gentleman knowing."
Really?
"Thank you, Mr. Ragdale."
May the Lord be with you.
And with Thy Spirit
"May almighty God bless you, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
Amen.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
Thanks be to God.
"Hello,"
I've been looking at this confession you gave me.
"Doesn't say very much, does it?"
"Ever thought of getting advice on your mood swings, Inspector?"
Hmm?
"So, you're back on the case?"
"No, no, I'm still suspended."
"This bit's a bit interesting,"
"'Salva me, fons pietatis'."
"Jimmy, this work is making you so tense."
"Look, I've got to talk to you about work."
"Honey, you know I don't like to talk about work."
"Yeah, well I..."
"I've made a few mistakes, and, uh, I don't know really..."
"Jimmy, you don't have cancer."
No one is dying.
"Whatever it is, whatever you've done, I'm sure you'll fix it."
Now can you write that check?
"I don't want Caitlin to be late, okay?"
It's just Suki is amazing.
"It doesn't hurt at all when she's waxing you, and it's really hard to get an appointment with her."
I know.
Why don't you get a manicure?
You could come with me.
"I mean, they're not just for girls."
You go.
We'll catch up later.
Holly's having a...
Holly's having a thing.
Perfect.
"So, you tell him anything?"
"No, but if anyone asks, you're Suki."
So you didn't tell them anything.
Um...actually I told them you went to Mexico for cockfights.
"You know what, though?"
"Even if they don't believe me, they'll never look for you here."
Did you seriously bring a loofah?
What's a loofah?
"Hey, you said bring whatever was around the house."
But I meant like survival supplies like rope or muskets and not...
Kio's cucumber moisturizer.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
What are you doing here?
I...
FITZGERALD:
We got horses over here!
"Hey, Bridger."
We got horses!
JIM:
What you want to do about these pigs?
FITZGERALD:
"The Lord's on our side, kid."
FITZGERALD:
"You all right there, kid?"
Your head in the right place?
I guess.
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right--
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
"My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?"
"If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it."
And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills.
San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine.
He done it like a hundred times before.
"Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day, it all went fucked."
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
And to top it off them Comanches went and took the horses.
"So he was starving and delirious and he crawls up into this mott, this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere just sticking up in this ocean of scrub and he found religion."
"At that moment, he told me he found God."
Uh-huh.
And it turns out that God He's a squirrel.
Yeah.
"A big, old meaty one."
"""I found God,"" he used to say."
Is that a girl who could kill herself?
"This is 1 957, Sam."
An unmarried girl that got pregnant was an outcast.
Sometimes they'd end the pregnancy.
Sometimes they'd even end their own lives.
- Maybe Greg helped her do both.
- You really think he killed her?
Hilla tried to break up with Greg on the fourth.
She said they fought all night.
"She broke with him, Al, but it was too late."
She was pregnant.
He's gotta be the killer.
But you've got no proof of that.
I've got feelings.
Feelings?
That's a song.
You've got no evidence.
- You got no gun.
You got no bullet.
You got nothin'.
- I got her.
You got shadow and light flickering on a wall.
That's not Hilla.
What you're seeing is in your imagination.
"[ Sam ] She's trying to tell me something, Al."
"I don't know what it is, but she's trying to tell me something."
"[ Sam Narrating ] As much as I hate to admit it, sometimes Al's right."
Hilla was haunting me in a way even I couldn't understand.
"But I kept thinking about the road she had traveled to get here... and all she had lost along the way... to die alone, buried and forgotten, with her murderer free."
I had to be here to change that.
[ Lyle ] I told you this was a waste of time.
Not really.
- It was his hat.
- What are you doing with his hat?
Why shouldn't I have his hat?
"Hanna, maybe you're looking for something a little edgier after Sean."
- But this guy is dark.
"- Spencer, he's not that dark."
He's dark enough.
"Well, he's no Arthur Dodger, whoever that is."
"Yeah, he's just had it tough."
Are you two on speaking terms again?
- Of course we are.
- You need to be careful about that guy.
It seems to me we had this conversation once about Toby.
I'm looking for Coach Fulton.
- Is the coach expecting you?
- The coach is avoiding me.
- That's what the coach is doing.
- Are you a parent?
"Yes, I'm a parent."
Nick McCullers.
My daughter is Paige McCullers.
I have your daughter in English Comp.
I'm Ezra Fitz.
The coach.
Why don't we walk to the principal's office see if we can find Coach Fulton?
I've seen the principal and all I got was politically correct double-talk.
About the agenda in this place that's penalizing my daughter.
Taking opportunities and giving them to someone who doesn't deserve them!
"Everybody gets a fair chance here, Mr. McCullers."
We go out of our way to make sure it works.
My girl is the best swimmer on that team.
You can't give it to somebody...
This is new territory for me.
"No, it's new for me too."
"I, uh..."
Maybe this trip and the juggling everything...
"Too much, too fast."
I think you're right.
Maybe we should go home tomorrow.
"Yeah, I think-- I think that'd be best."
♪
"So I'm the best man, standing in front of... 300 people?"
Mmhmm.
"And I hear ""beep, beep, beep."""
So I silence my pager.
It was a pager.
"90 seconds later,"
"""beep, beep, beep, beep."""
You got to be panicking at this point.
Think about how the guests feel.
Everyone assumes it's an international emergency.
"I know I have to take it, but it's in the middle of the ceremony, so I go back down the aisle, past the 300 people, and out the door."
Everyone must think China's invaded Russia.
Everybody's thinking China's invaded America.
"So Arthur's outside making the call, and the priest-- and I swear to God this is true--"
Starts leading the church in a prayer for our nation's safety.
So what was the page?
Low battery.
You two are like a comedy team.
"Yeah, we're thinking about taking our show on the road."
"Well, from what I hear, you'll get to do that sooner rather than later."
"Come on, we both know you invited us here to talk about the ambassadorship."
- Guilty.
- No.
- Can't you just do what I say?
"- Of course, dear Anna."
Don't I always do what you want?
"Well, just get going..."
"Morning, Mrs Ziemann."
Is everything fine?
"Selma, you shouldn't place the child here in the fumes."
It's so unhealthy.
"Outside it's too cold, in the stairwell too draughty, and here it's too fumy!"
Where shall I take the little mite?
"Well, maybe you can make yourself useful at least!"
"Come, help Mrs Ziemann with the basket."
I need to lie down for a bit.
"Are you not feeling well, Mrs John?"
"Oh, Mr Hassenreuter, it's the usual, you know..."
The child is coughing!
It comes from smoking.
"Mother smokes all day and because the child coughs, she cannot sleep."
and I'm fed up with it all.
That's tragic!
It makes one ask oneself who the real mother is.
"Well put, Mr Hassenreuter, and so true!"
Sometimes it seems to me as if I gave birth to it myself.
"Are you looking for me, Anna?"
"Man, did you give me a fright, Bruno!"
Where have you been?
Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
As if I didn't suspect that we'd need rat poison again.
I've just brought some from the drugstore.
You lay it out tomorrow so we'll get rid of that plague.
"Using the Lisol, you mop up here."
"Ooh, but there is a ""Whittle Your Own Banjo"" workshop at 5:00."
I have whittle-to-no interest in that.
"Ooh, it says they have the loosest slots around."
I guess the Darby sisters from my hometown are here.
I did see a bunch of lounge chairs over by the swamp exhibit.
"I guess we could sleep there tonight, and then the next night, well, hopefully we'll be dead."
"Come on, red!"
"Max, no!"
That's all of our money!
No more bets.
"Oh, that is so stupid, and not cute stupid like when you thought Velcro grew in nature."
And red is the winner.
"Well, rootin' tootin'!"
"I always bet on red because my last name's Black, and that's ah-not been a winner."
"Okay, now that we've doubled our money,"
- maybe we should stop.
"- Come on, red!"
- No more bets.
- No!
I didn't even get to touch it before you lost it.
Why do you hate having things?
Red again.
Just call me Al Roker 'cause I'm making it rain.
"Max, we're winning at something."
"Don't just stand there looking pretty, toots."
Order daddy some wings.
"Oh, my God, I look pretty and I get to flag down a waitress."
Waitress!
I'll have a sarsaparilla and some wings for big daddy.
Sophie's calling.
"Pfft, like I'm gonna get it."
"Well, Caroline's not answering."
Why?
Did something happen with SBK?
Nope.
Something happened with Chivonne.
There's a banger.
Lucien.
"He a player, runs some corners."
He got it in his head that Chivonne is gonna be his girlfriend.
And he don't care what she got to say about it.
What do you mean?
Happens sometimes.
"Youngblood sees something he likes, decides it's his."
Doesn't matter that she don't like him.
It don't matter that she just 14.
"One way or another, he gonna get what he wants."
"Now, this boy, Lucien, he keep coming at her, got his boys following her, just making her life hell."
Did she talk to the police?
You mean did she snitch?
No.
"She worried that it's gonna come back on her and her aunt, and it would."
That's why she came to me.
What did she ask you to do?
I wouldn't let her say the words but I know what she need me to do.
And truth is...
I want to do it.
That's my baby girl.
"Anybody mess with her, they deserve what they get."
"Crazy, huh?"
"Everything I've been doing, working with you, working with the police, it was so, eventually,"
I can be a father to her.
Turns out what she really need is a gangster.
I don't blame you for wanting to protect your daughter.
"Once he's got him, she's got all of little Stempington."
- Does the whole town know about this?
- No.
But those who do are too frightened to talk.
I haven't told you about The Wicker Barn.
"God's sake, get down, Joyce."
Ah!
"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
I'm pissing blood all over Margaret's new rug.
- It's Scotchgard protected.
"- Better answer that, Joyce."
"You might want to move the Panda, Joyce."
We've decided to issue a little warning.
"You could help us take her down, Joyce."
- How?
- We've never had anyone on the inside.
Think about it.
That's all I ask.
- You should go now.
(Pam) Welcome to Little Stempington.
"(Hilary) Hello, Joyce."
- ..someone I'm dying for you to meet.
"Joyce, at last."
"Hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
You're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn.
(Hilary) I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
"(Camilla) You don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the click-clink for the next ten years, do you...do you...do you?"
- They made me do it.
"- Too late for excuses, Joyce."
"darling, please."
I'm afraid...
I'm gonna have to take you straight upstairs for questioning.
"Mac became ""Dr. John."""
Seemed like a whole 'nother life...
Another person came in and started something new over here.
"He's a character, man."
- What's his deal?
- He's an original cat.
He's cooler than you.
And he's cooler than everybody you'll ever meet.
Did you create Dr. John to be a front man?
No.
"I was gonna make Ronnie Barron be ""Dr. John,"""
"and I was gonna call him ""Reverend Ether."""
"Frank Sinatra's manager or arranger, or whatever the hell he was, said, ""If Sonny and 'Cheryl' could sing, and if Bob Dylan could sing, you could sing, asshole."""
I think he hit a raw nerve with me and it hit home.
"He's amazing, you know?"
"It's like, everything that he plays is the best thing ever."
It's perfectly behind the beat.
Everything he knows about music is so pure and so... complete.
"It's like, nasty and dirty, but intelligent and, uh... you can hear a million years of music in everything he does."
It's that guy's bachelor party this week.
I fucking met that dude yesterday.
Right there.
That dude with the fucking headband and the sunglasses.
"- Oh, not him."
- No way!
Yep.
I told him we were playing here tonight.
And his dad!
He's with his dad!
What's up?
"Look, dude's in the headband."
He brought his dad on his bach' party.
"Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor."
I'm fried.
"Honey, I think the fear was a lot worse than the actual attack, which I can totally appreciate, but the good news is you weren't hurt, so let's not ruin the evening over it."
I'm sorry?
"Honey, you weren't hurt."
Good night.
Dave!
Where you going?
Dave.
"Come on, okay, you got bit by the shark."
"You got bit, I believe you!"
"We're here all the time, so let's take that opportunity to go to bed."
"Honey, we'll go to the waterfall with you."
We'll grab our drinks and go.
Yeah.
We could all go together.
It'll be beautiful.
Hon?
"I was thinking that maybe we might go back to the room, huh?"
"Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?"
Just shut the whole world out and sit Indian-style and really explore our feelings.
Daddy!
Wake up!
It's too deep!
"Yo, you having a nightmare."
You ain't even in the water.
It's night time.
"Look, you said we was gonna have fun, so let's get up, let's dance, let's do a shot, let's do something."
Anything.
"Baby, let's just go back to the room, all right?"
I don't want to go back to the room.
I don't want to go to sleep.
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, well, it's-- it's a mess."
Would you like to grab some coffee?
That's a spectacularly bad idea.
You're right.
I grabbed the wrong file.
"I meant to grab the file of ""reasonably bad ideas,"""
"but I grabbed the ""spectacularly bad ones"" instead."
Been that kind of day.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Just one.
"This is dumb, hanging out here waiting for him."
"Well, do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a $2 movie theater?"
Or he could be hiking in Griffith Park for all we know.
"I know, I know."
We should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em.
Don't be snippy with me.
I'm not on your damn TV show.
"God, I hate this day."
"Well, I'm not exactly over the moon about it, either."
I know what Jonathan would do.
"He would call some friend in Washington, and there'd be some really fancy, expensive detective here with Justin in about four hours."
"Well, why don't you call him?"
"You know, you really can tell me the problem with him."
I swear I won't judge.
The problem... doesn't feel like you and Dad.
I guess they don't make 'em like that anymore.
Oh.
Look.
"Oh, yeah..."
- We've just had too many damn blessings.
She doesn't know that it looks as though he was alive when he was buried.
Does she need to know that?
She's asked to see the body.
"Well, you should do your best to put her off."
"Well, you can't stop her if she wants to see him."
Some people don't believe it until they see it.
I know.
But it's her son in there.
I think maybe I should do this.
Sure?
Just don't let her see the body.
"Oh, please."
No.
Not David.
I'm sorry.
Who did this?
We hope to find out more from the post-mortem.
Can I see him?
"You have the right to, of course, but I'd advise you not to."
Many changes have occurred to the body.
"He was my baby, my boy."
"From what I've read of David's work, he had a strong belief that death was not the end."
"You did well there, Nikki."
I remembered that stuff about the resurrection of the body from my gran's funeral.
Wouldn't want too many resurrections of the body.
We'd be out of a job.
I worry about you.
You'll be speaking in tongues next.
"When are you going to accept the truth, sinner?"
I wish I could find some truth right now.
Still looking for a reason?
I'm not sure there is a reason.
What are you talking about?
Welovethisidea.
"No,  you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it, too."
How many people do you know that would actually pay money to party on The Mystery Machine?
A lot of people.
"There's Tom, my co-worker Sam-- he loves this idea."
"And, uh..."
Crap.
I'm an idiot.
Oh.
"No, you're not."
Come on.
Just because this idea isn't great doesn't mean the next one's not gonna be.
I believe in you.
Oh.
"Oh, now we're out of wine."
I don't want to go all the way to the store to get it.
Why can't wine just appear whenever you want it to?
- Bye.
- Where are you going?
"Uh, I just want to go look into something."
But I'll catch up with you later-- maybe when you're done sucking that cork.
Shut up.
I don't do that.
"[ Door opens, closes ]"
"Dang, sad pitt."
Why the long face?
I was dropping mad knowledge on these shorties till this wangsta scrub came in and ganked my crew.
"Oh, I was helping out with a children's music class till another teacher came in and took my spot."
"I mean, me and the kids were having so much fun-- you know, really connecting."
And then this guy just came in and took over.
I feel you.
No.
"I've just come from work, actually!"
I just thought I'd...
I'm trying to make my hair and coat sort of join.
So we don't know where one ends and one begins?
Like a sort of Camden owl.
LAUGHTER
"Now then, where does your style come from?"
Em...
"And this sounds rude, but were you always like this?"
I guess so.
My mum's quite stylish.
Yeah.
My dad used to be.
"In the '70s, he'd wear mental clothes."
"Like yellow flares and tops with stars on them, then he went quite straight in the '80s."
You had young parents.
Your mum was 18?
"Yeah, really young."
So they were really cool and dressed like they were in Black Sabbath.
Then all of a sudden in the '80s my dad got quite square.
"""That's enough of yellow flares."
"I'll just wear a shirt and some leisure trousers."""
"He just stopped, but my mum carried on."
Where was this?
In South London.
What was hilarious was they had this three-wheeler car called a Bomb Bug.
An orange thing and the roof went up like that.
So not only did they wear yellow flares and had a three-wheeled orange triangle car...
I was just a laughing stock!
"It sounds like you grew up in a cartoon, didn't you?"
"It was a bit like Roobarb and Custard, yeah."
That should be me.
I should be doing that time.
No.
We went over this.
It's good.
How's it good?
"It's a minimum-security place in Phoenix, and, no, I am not going to tell you which one."
She'll get out of there and she'll be fine.
"You keep your promise and steer clear, and she can have a good life."
She can do what she's supposed to do.
"I mean if I can't be there for her, man, you gotta promise me that you will be."
I promise.
Then you should do something for me.
I was able to fence the watches.
"Don't judge, I'm giving it all to her."
And the car.
"I got a clean VIN number for it, so it's legit, and it just..."
"It'll feel like I'm there with her, you know?"
"Money is not what she needs, not for what's ahead."
Can you just see that she gets it?
Sure.
And one more thing.
"If anything changes, like she does her job, this insanity ends, if she's free..."
I'll send you a postcard.
(SCREAMING)
I'm not what you think!
"You're a thief, and you poisoned me, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think."
No!
You have a compass.
I need it!
I don't care what you need.
"(GRUNTS) No, for my son."
They're gonna lock you away.
You come here to get my statement?
Huh?
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.
"Leave him to the boogeyman to rip him apart, or return him to whatever ungodly dirt he came from."
And if the road couldn't do it...
"I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes that's just what you got to do."
"Well, you've done enough."
Ah.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
Asshole.
Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.
He's been reported missing this morning.
Boys need stupid things to do.
That's how their mamas wire them.
"Well, his mama wasn't no electrician."
Explains the dim bulb.
It's not like you to be so funny so early.
Well...
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you a whole lot more than you liked him.
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.
"He's missing, I'm worried."
"It doesn't have to be so black-and-white, Lilly."
For fuck's sake.
All I'm saying is that... maybe he's gone because he wants to be gone.
"This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?"
This is about Wallace coming back.
"Hey, do you want to take care of this?"
"Oh, Jerry, you're just aching for coffee, aren't you?"
Here.
"I'm only thinking of you, josie."
What about nick?
He's disloyal!
He goes down with the rest!
"Must everyone go down except you, jim?"
You don't realize what you're doing.
People are losing everything.
They're suffering.
They're being ruined.
They're killing themselves.
"You're hated, jim."
"But only by the little people, josie."
"Are we any different than little people, jim?"
I was one when i met you.
You made me big with your courage and your ideas and your money.
"But if this is what it means, i don't want it, jim."
It comes too high.
What do we care what the world is saying?
"Tomorrow, i'll buy it and give it to you!"
I don't want it!
"Right now, there are only two people in this world that count-you and me!"
I'm just beginning to feel the power that's in me.
I know now that nothing can stop me.
Whatever stands in my way must go down!
"Jim, i don't know you."
I'm almost afraid of you.
"No, you're not afraid of me."
"You're afraid of life, josie."
But i'm going to make you love it as much as i do as much as i love you.
"What's happened to you, jim?"
You used to be kind and generous.
You were the kindest man i ever knew.
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
"When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave."
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street.
"I'm sorry, but..."
I could give you a couple dollars to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
"He lives on Fourth Street, near here."
"They break the windows, they dirty the floors..."
"A real pig-sty, eh?"
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted for no good reason.
"She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her."
"She has no relatives, no money."
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
Oh.
"Well, I-I guess we might have a minute."
Uh... is there...
anything you'd like to share with the students?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I got somethin'."
"They tell you you gotta learn your a-b-c's, but what they don't tell you is, you gotta learn them backwards while balancing on one foot with a flashlight in your face while some guy you went to high school with"
calls you a punk on account of he became a cop and you swerved a little and hit a fire hydrant.
Ha!
(Bell rings) Oh!
Look at that.
Time for lunch.
"Let's please form a line, uh, by the door."
Go!
(Children speaking indistinctly)
"Hey, come on."
I'll take you to lunch.
"Uh, I don't know."
I think I'm supposed to tell the principal if I leave the school.
"No, we don't need to bother the principal."
"You know, they don't want some stranger coming in, saying he's gonna take a small child. (Chuckles)"
Hmm.
"Bye, guys."
Gotta go.
Taking aunt Ginny to the movies.
"Of course, she calls it ""The Picture Show."""
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
(Door opens and closes) Isn't it nice how good mom is to the aunts?
(Scoffs and chuckles)
What?
You cannot be that big of an idiot.
You really have no idea where mom's going?
"Well, call me when you're free."
What are you doing?
I finally decided to get my act together.
"Wait, this isn't about your audition tape for So You Think You Can Dance."
"No, not that act."
"Ooh, although I did watch that tape the other day and I don't think I can dance..."
I can dance.
I have decided to get organized.
"You know how I'm always writing little reminders to myself on little scraps of paper, and then nothing ever gets done?"
"Well, from now on, everything I have to do is going on this board."
"Come on, help me."
- This one has gum in it.
- All right.
"Well, then skip it, give me another one."
"""Get dry erase board."""
Huh.
"What do I do, should I write it down then cross it out?"
"God, I don't know."
This has never happened before.
"Okay, give me another one."
What's a witch detective?
"Oh, that's my idea for a TV show."
"- Oh, that's really good."
- Yeah.
"All right, um, oh, here."
Grandparents' Day-- this Friday.
Write that down.
What's Grandparents' Day?
"Oh, it's another way Ritchie's school has of getting money."
"They invite all the grandparents for a pancake breakfast, and try to get them to include Westbridge into their wills."
"Wait... uh, Mom and Dad are coming here this weekend?"
You can't just spring this on me.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
It's weird how something has to happen sometimes... to see how you actually feel about something.
"Sit down, Mr. Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
Is my husband with you?
Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
"The ice broke, and - and then some of our dogs died."
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do?
Take her to Dawson and leave her.
"You're forgetting one thing, pal."
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map - the original one.
"You'll find my husband for me, won't you?"
There's nothing we can do.
We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
"Either the cold got him, or the wolves."
- Get on the sled.
We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead.
I
- I don't believe that.
"Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone."
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
"If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me."
No!
No!
How's he holding up?
Same as he always was.
"They wanna lock him up, he says, ""Yes, sir, lock me up. """
"They wanna put him on trial, he says, ""Yes, sir, put me on trial. """
He'd help tie the noose if they asked him to.
He's your father.
What's the matter with you?
When I was about 7 years old...
... ourownersdecidedtosell him and us kids away from our mother.
Put us on a wagon and we ended up going to Alabama.
She stayed behind in Georgia.
"And after a while, he had told me that she died."
"Now, I was just a little boy at the time, but all that time..."
... Iwaitedforhim tofind away  to keep our mother with us...
... oruswithher .
But he never said one word.
He didn't do anything.
"He didn't argue, he didn't even beg."
He didn't put up one damn ounce of fight to keep our family together.
Harsh.
He should have done something.
What are you doing with all that string?
Keeping my mind busy.
What's a white lady doing in jail?
My own son locked me up.
Sometimes they don't rightly appreciate what you do for them.
Truer words were never spoken.
[EZRA chuckling ]
"Well, well."
"My, my."
"It's a touch baroque, but I like what you've done with the place."
-What do you want?
"Now I hear people say, ""But Ellsberg did itforthe good ofthe country."""
"You know, ""The people's rightto know."" You know."
"Well, well, neverthe case,"
"Alger Hiss said the same damn thing, and so did the Rosenbergs."
Look what happened to them.
[Imitates Electrical Charge]
Old Sparky got'em.
"They always underestimated old Nixon, see."
We're gonna fight just as dirty.
"This is sudden death, gentlemen."
"We're gonna getthem on the ground, stick in our spikes... and twistand showthem no mercy."
"So, uh, starting today, no one in this room talks to the press, uh, withoutchecking first with Mr. Haldeman here."
"And, uh, thatmeans, Ron, a complete freeze on the New York Times, CBS,"
"PBS, Jack Anderson and the Washington Post."
"Um, Mr. Haldeman is the chief high executionerfrom now on, so don'tyou come whining to me when he tells you to do something."
"That's me talking, okay?"
"And ifyou do come to me, I'll be tougherthan he is."
"Anyone who screws with us, his fucking head comes off."
You gotthat?
"Well, thank you very much, gentlemen, and, uh, good day to you."
- [Nixon] History will never be the same.
- [Man Speaking Spanish]
- We're taking a step into the future.
"- Liddy, give them the folder."
- We have changed the world.
"- Five, ten."
- Let's see whatelse you got.
[Anthem]
[ShutterClicking]
"- I mustsay, you look very good."
- [TranslatorSpeaking Chinese]
- [Speaking Chinese] - [Translator] Looks can be deceiving.
"He thinks you are planning an attack at the school with someone, he doesn't know it's with me."
What are we doing here?
I'm getting you safe.
Nicole Carter
"Isaac's not on anyone's books, he's got guns, he's got men, he can protect you."
You think because he's your brother he's just gonna forget what happened?
"There is something inside that box and they're after it, so where is it?"
Ben Grimes
What is it?
It's a list.
Sleeper cells.
"These codes go out, they launch attacks all over the country."
Where's the chip?
"Government wants this list,"
They're gonna have to pay up.
Please don't do this.
Ben!

"Rebecca,"
It's Carter.
Ben got away.
Please tell me you're still tracking him.
"We were, he left the construction site heading east, but we lost him on 13th."
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen."
You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do
"- I think, you need to ease off a little bit."
- Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you but actually they all getting really annoyed."
They are?
"Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a thirdgrader but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
"All that singing and dancing, I can't stand it."
You don't like doing it?
It's just don't me.
What I really wanna do is just-- play basketball.
- Basketball?
- I love it.
Always have.
I've missed a game on TV.
When my dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
Dude.
You should do that.
"You should join the basketball team, right now."
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want."
- Really?
- When you grow up into a fourthgrader you'll understand that you'll have to be tough and direct with your parents.
Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
- to save your family.
- And I would not wish the pain of that failure upon anyone.
I would rather live with that pain than this.
"And that's just the thing, Sara."
"Look, if you were able to try to save Laurel, then you wouldn't be alive at all."
Then fine.
I don't care.
"When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline."
"Now had it remained the same, then Damien Darhk would have..."
He would have killed not only you and...
"and your sister, but your father as well."
"But, Rip, if... if we go back, and we take the team..."
The outcome would be exactly the same.
You don't know that.
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.
I...
There's got to be a way.
"Rip, I have to be able to do something."
I'm so sorry.
"Look, I can't."
Can't do this without my sister.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
"You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, Sara."
Laurel...
"Laurel may be beyond your saving, but Kendra and Carter, they might not be."
"Captain, we are prepared to make the time jump to 1944."
"We're on our way, Gideon."
We've arrived in Saint-Lô.
"No sign of Kendra yet, but I have located"
"Vandal Savage, and he does not seem to be alone."
"Dad, What's this mess?"
"You didn't met her, You gave me her picture in envelope,"
Then how could I met her?
"And this one was for another Laxmi,"
Who is this another Laxminarayan?
"Sir, which kind of bomb you make?"
"It doesn't works,"
"Mr. Laxmi, I have diploma,"
Where you get this diploma's from?
"Papa, let's go to the straight, and press it from front, some things doesn't works to press from back side,"
I came here to take underwear and I got car.
"Think about that Laxminarayan, who came here to take car... and take underwear from here."
"It's the same car, what I was talking about,"
"This car was in your luck, not in that Laxminarayan, don't know where he would be?"
"Excuse me Madam, Excuse me Madam,"
"Excuse me Madam, Excuse me Sir, Can I come in?"
"Can I come in, Can I say something?"
Sure!
"Sir, Madam, I am that another Laxminarayan,"
"He was in my next room, Right Sir!"
"Madam, I came here to but this car for Mr. Pipot,"
Oh!
Yeah!
"He called me, Right Madam."
"I am his special man, Pipot's man?"
Right Sir!
"Tell me one thing,"
Your Pipot didn't have any women?
"No Sir, He have two women,"
Two Women?
Right Sir!
"And he keep a man, Which kind of man he is?"
"Well, he's come back to life."
What are his paintings worth?
Depends on size.
"And artistic merit, presumably."
"Not really, just size."
(Mobile phone rings)
He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.
What's he done with all of it?
"Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you."
"No, I won't."
"This is crap, isn't it, Flick?"
Complete.
"No, this time you've gone too far."
"I've spoken to the lawyers, you're never going to see your son again."
I don't know how you can look at yourself every morning without throwing up.
Am I going to get a look-in on this conversation?
"No, because I know exactly what you're going to say so you can spare me the smart remarks."
"I don't know how you could let this happen in your own apartment, your own son."
"Oh, that's what this is about."
"Wendy, he's 15 years old, alright, almost 16."
He's got a girlfriend.
"Oh, you are genuinely sick if you think this is appropriate."
All I did was save our son 50 bucks on a room in some flea pit.
He's a kid.
He's in love with another kid.
With another kid?
!
Yes.
It's a girl in his English class.
He told me all about it.
"The girl from his English class is his fucking English teacher, you moron!"
Oh...
Those two.
"All right, ma'am, I've just spoken to Amy."
Her and Dan are with Pierce and his mom at the hospital.
- But there's been a holdup.
"- Oh, God."
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.
That evil bitch.
And Richard and Jonah are there.
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.
"Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup."
"Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something."
I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.
"- All right, stop it, Gary."
"- Okay, look, get Pierce here."
Okay?
Right now.
"I'm gonna take control of this situation that I don't know anything about, right?"
Because I am the only one who seems to be...
Capable.
"Oh, God."
Is it possible to stop coughing?
No!
- You are not taking him.
- His jittery ass is mine.
"- Guys, I'm right here."
"- I'm sorry, your jittery ass is the president's."
"You shouldn't even be here, Jonah, unless you're giving your brain to science."
"I'm here on behalf of the president, Amy."
Do you remember her?
She's the woman that would have fired you if you hadn't gone fucking Fukushima.
"That's right, we're on a mission."
I am surprised the two of you even found your way out of your own mothers' vaginas.
Give it up for...
The amazing Mr Lifto
"It's not my call but for security reasons, you guys have to leave there."
It's all good...
"Dude, that was my beer."
This song's about.... fucking...
I'm drunk.
And right now I'm so (in love with you).
And I (don't want to think too much about what we...) ...should or shouldn't do.
"Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars,"
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel...
Thanks man.
"What did you throw up, man, what did you throw?"
Can I have a towel in exchange?
Thanks man...
I swear.
Right now I found everything I need.
"The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins... are listening to me."
Well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown.
My moral standing is lying down.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
I was just making sure you were alive.
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home.
"And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too."
"It wasn't a party, it was one guy."
Don't be so judgey.
I talked to Roberta at the Grill and... there's still a bartending position open.
If you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I work there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Don't act so surprised.
"- Well, I mean, I just..."
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there's back grant due."
"- It's back in everything, mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- That's Caroline.
Easy.
"Yeah, come in."
"Okay, we're gonna be late, so, let's just get going."
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts me down."
Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
I don't know.
"He waited 145 years, only to find out that Katherine could not care less."
"That's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Jing-Mei was first on the scene.
- Is she okay?
- A little freaked.
"I don't get it, man, how you could just roll over."
- That's the way it works sometimes.
"- Yeah, if you let it."
"- What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit?"
- That's one way to fight it.
- There is no fighting it.
"- You know, I don't buy that."
Carter wants the output on Bed 4 before he leaves.
"Look, we could be perfect, you know, like Gandhi."
"But as soon as the crap goes down, we'll be the first ones laid out with a gun to our head."
"Now, where I grew up, you see it every day."
"And if it happens to you enough, you get the message."
You are not equal.
You are not a full citizen.
"You are first, last and, above all, one thing and one thing only:"
A suspect.
You sure you wanna wait out here?
"Yeah, there's too many sick people in there."
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Hey.
Cold enough for you?
My mom went ahead to help set up stuff for the home hospice team.
- Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
- I think you' re doing the right thing.
I think it doesn't matter what you think.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
Guess it all just feels so much more real now.
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.
10-4 and out.
DUD:
Just give the names of the two suspects.
"Ray Malcolm and Lane ""Pluto"" Franklin."
Give a description of the girl and say the victims were stabbed to death.
How many stab wounds?
"No, don't mention that, or the hog-tying or the pillowcases."
What about the three other victims?
Just say they were strangled.
And what about the kid?
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor and that we think the suspects fled the state.
Might get us some national coverage and make it hard for them to travel.
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.
Okay.
Play it up that they're as violent as we've ever seen.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's the story on this Star City thing?
"Somebody, come on."
Dud?
Would it be a wild goose chase if you went down there?
"We've been lucky so far, and we can tie Ray there."
The police chief in Star City said he didn't know of Ray or Fantasia but he thought he'd heard of the uncle and was going to check them out.
I'm just waiting for his phone call back.
What about an ID on the second suspect?
JOHN:
"They call him ""Pluto."""
His real name is Lane Franklin.
What is it?
Lady Yuhwa requests your audience.
A terrible rumor about Jumong is spreading through the Palace.
Have you heard it?
Have you?
I think something bad has happened to Jumong.
Something bad?
What's that?
From what I've heard...
I think Jumong is dead.
Yuhwa.
I don't buy it.
"But if you say so, I'll gladly check his corpse."
I'll let go of all the hard feelings if you let me and Yesoya leave.
Yuhwa.
You won't need hostages now thatJumong's dead.
Let us go.
I can't.
Your Majesty.
Jolbon will turn into a battlefield the minute the Han and Puyo attack.
"If you go now, I can't guarantee your safety."
I know how you feel but I can't send you to your death.
Do you really know how I feel?
Do you know what it feels like to hear of your son's death?
I'm just as sad as you are.
I tried to sever my ties with him but he's still my son.
I'll protect you and Yesoya.
I'll raise Yuri to make up for it.
If you really thought of Jumong as your son... then you wouldn't dare wage war against the Damul Army.
Please.
Stop deceiving yourself.
"You say you're protecting me, but you're making my life a living hell."
Here he is.
He waded in the water to help someone out.
He was helping them onto the boat-- they're here.
They made it home.
But he took a bullet.
"It came out of I don't know where, and..."
"He was as near to me as you are, and I saw the light go out of his eyes."
"But I said I'd bring him back, and I brought him back, even though it meant taking up space that could have been used by someone else."
Here he is.
Edith:
Dead?
Foyle:
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
But why?
He weren't a soldier.
The war was nothing to do with him.
Why did he have to go?
"Well, he believed it was right."
"Edith, whatever Margaret Ellis has told you, there isn't going to be a German invasion now, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps not ever."
How did she frighten you into cutting the wires?
She didn't.
What did she say was going to happen to you when the Germans came?
Nothing.
"She knew, didn't she?"
She knew that your grandmother is Jewish?
She said I wouldn't be allowed to work anymore.
She said I'd be put in a camp...
[Sobbing]
"That she wanted to look after me, but first, I'd have to prove myself..."
Do something to show I was on her side.
I didn't think it would matter that much.
If someone hadn't helped me...
I wouldn't be here.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm good.
"Listen, I hate to ask, but"
I need your help with something.
"Uh, of course."
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.
"Um, are you free for lunch?"
Yeah.
"I have some stuff that I need to do for work, but that sounds great."
"So you guys, I've been thinking about a plan."
"You know, right now this could very well be the first stop on our pancake tour of North America."
"Hey, like in On The Road."
That's my favorite book.
"Mine, too."
So here's the deal.
My mom had this boyfriend.
He hired me to work construction last summer.
But then they broke up...he moved away...to Austin.
In Texas?
"Said if I was ever out there look him up, so..."
"I mean, well, that's really kind of far."
We were thinking like Long Beach or something so we can all still hang out.
I'll need to get a couple of days of work so I can get a little bit of travel money.
"Well, I mean, we can get you money."
"Well, I mean, I guess in a way you're kind of lucky."
"You get to move to a whole new place, start over, be whoever you want to be."
That's really not so bad.
"Hey, putz."
"Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?"
"-BE guy, a real juicer."
-He's in AA now.
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.
They can treat this shit nowadays.
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.
This one in rehab now.
I was so upset when he didn't bring me a present back from Italy.
He got something for A.J. and for Meadow.
"He gave me some vinegar, but I don't think it was meant for me."
"It must've meant something, that he felt bad."
"Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old."
I say I'm helping him decorate.
I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.
"If Tony suspects one iota, you know what'll happen to Furio."
These guys are living in a different century.
-It didn't stop you.
-Steve at the gym?
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.
It took Jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop.
-We haven't slept together yet.
-You're not fucking him?
So this isn't really real.
It is real.
We communicate.
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.
"Just those few minutes when we see each other, I live for those."
I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and I will never be happy.
- Thank you.
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.
"Oh, I'd love to see it."
"Oh, it's darling."
I didn't show you my lizard.
I keep him in a box right there.
"I got some holes punched in it, just so he can breathe."
His name is Pocahontas.
"Used to be, a man didn't have to cook his own meals in his own house."
Times have changed.
"Ma's working, and I'm late for church."
"The way you parade yourself up and down, taking off your clothes..."
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!
"Just because we don't live in a palace, doesn't mean we have to act like pigs."
"- We've got a trash can, remember?"
"- Well, well, well."
"If you don't pick it up, somebody else has to."
And it wouldn't harm you to take the garbage out and bury it.
Or do you like living like a pig?
"What do you think you are, always giving orders?"
Take your hands off of me!
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!
Just a little family fracas.
Guess my little girl's getting too big to spank.
"It was my fault, Allison."
I made him mad.
Every family has fights.
Don't eat the pie.
You'll never leave.
Where is he?
"Oh, His Royal Highness?"
I believe he's holding court over there.
Eric.
Dad!
Hey!
"Dad, these are the guys, and this is Irene."
Hi.
"Nice to meet you, Irene."
Guys.
"Uh, Eric, your mother and I decided that you were responsible enough to take your brother on the road for two months."
"Now, is this the way you thank us?"
I was going to call you in the morning and let you know my plans.
I'll tell you your plans.
You're going to get in your car and follow me home without stopping anywhere.
Now.
Come on.
"Um, actually, I'd rather stay here with Irene and the guys."
Maybe we better do this in private.
"So, there's a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in this town?"
"Well, I could use a nurse."
"Now, why don't you tell me what this is really about?"
I don't think you'd understand.
Try me.
I don't see the point in going back home.
Why not?
"Because there's nothing there for me, Dad."
"I mean, I went to nursery school, grammar school, high school, for what?"
"I mean, I didn't get into college."
"Everything I've done up until now has been a waste, and it's just too late to change who I am."
The only thing shot was a bottle of soda.
I don't even know if you should go there alone anymore.
Maybe we should drop you off every morning.
Dad !
The gun was in the school.
We can't be with her all day.
We are not going to change our entire lives over this.
There was one stupid gun shot.
You are not dropping me at school.
God. I'm not an eight years old.
At my school this kid slipped on this wet spot.
And fell.
Like on his face.
Maybe we should take her out of school.
- Honey.
- Put her in private school.
- l wish we could afford that.
- Maybe that's not an excuse.
Maybe we should sacrifice other things.
Like the house in Palm Beach?
This is our daughter we are talking about.
I know.
"Listen, I don't know why the world's gone so crazy..."
and I don't know what to do about it.
I wish we could keep them...
in some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
I'm not asking for a bubble.
"How about just a place where they can live, and walk to school..."
and become grownups without having to worry about...
guns and Al D S and serial murderers.
That didn't use to be exotic.
That wasn't the province of the rich.
I don't mind going 75 to 150 miles a day.
I think this is proof that We need to keep going back.
Captain kris kelly Finally notches a success.
Let's get the boat Ready.
And things are looking up For the kellys.
We're gonna make 100 ounces In the river this season.
Everybody's on my team now.
We're gonna go back there And kill it.
I packed the trailer.
So we can get the quad In the back-up.
- My god.
- -what the
I got too many bills to pay.
You can't do this.
You said you'd use it Before for one day.
I got to work.
"I got to make a living, too."
I need it back down there.
"Gearing up this morning,"
"Getting ready to hit The river again,"
And what happens?
My dad's friend comes along.
That he's borrowing The boat from.
So now I'm back at square one.
I don't have a boat To go river mining with.
I've got a claim that we know There's gold at.
And we just can't get it again.
"Okay, we'll meet You down there."
We'll put it Back in there.
I don't want to go down a bad Road with you guys.
"Don't worry, We'll bring it right back."
Without a dredge Built Specifically for river Mining...
"Hi, honey."
Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?
This is the same fight as breakfast.
It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.
"That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with."
"Hal,"
I'm not about to lose it with a...
"God, how does he do that?"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Please, we have to stop."
I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.
One last time.
"One, two, three, go!"
This is gonna be so great!
This is the answer.
What's the question?
"I don't know yet, but this is definitely the answer."
Would you look at this?
Jamie poured flour in the dryer.
Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.
He destroys everything!
He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!
"Oh, you say that with every kid."
"Let's face it, Lois."
It's just the hand we were dealt.
God just doesn't like us.
That doesn't make us bad people.
"No, there's something different with Jamie."
He's not like the other ones.
"I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes."
"Honey, calm down."
You know what will make you feel better?
I'm calling the diner for help.
Han...
"Caroline, we don't have a good connection, and not just because we're dueling Scorpios."
Peek-a-boo!
I see you!
Oleg.
"All right, now do it with Barbara."
"Han, we had all of our belongings thrown out of a private plane."
"Caroline, you're cutting out."
"All I heard was ""private plane."" Brag much?"
"No, we need to get to Texas, so can you please put $500 in my PayPal account?"
What?
You have $500?
Did I call you to gloat when I bought this snazzy new vest?
I'm putting you on speaker.
Private plane...
Have... credit card...
We lost her.
Or maybe her butler snatched her phone from her.
"Oh, God."
He hung up.
"Max, can we just go back to that terrible place we call home?"
That mountain lion is wearing my new blouse.
And here she comes!
Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.
I'm calling the credit card company to send us new cards.
They're used to hearing me cry.
"So is the unfortunate family that sat behind us at ""Zootopia."""
"If animals can all get along, so can we."
"Look, once we get our cards, we'll be on our way to Randy in Texas... and what was in this for me again?"
5 1/2 near-death experiences?
"Hi, Visa."
Where is Bathroom?
"Bathroom is on left, Whose left?"
Yours or mine?
"Your Tamil will take my life, And I am M.A. Munay."
"Murli Manohar Monday, not enough, not less, bubble gum."
"You told me to come and get the money at 12:00, so it's 12:00,"
"Jia Jee, today I am in serious mode, so cut the crap, bubble gum."
"Please have it, Please!"
Look!
I am not feeling very well and my head is so hot.
Then make your head cool and take coconut.
"Then sit under the coconut tree,"
"Not coconut, why you're saying coconut?"
"You gave my money or I'll take it, Sorry!"
May I have water?
"Jia Jee, someone fire a bullet."
It's not like that you call some guys here to kill me.
"There are nobody, Jiaa, M.M. Munday not enough, not less."
Bubble Gum.
Very much.
"But Munday won't afraid to any bad guy, you just wait here I'll be back."
What the hell?
Where is this Laxminarayan?
It isn't like this that he's here and he's not recognizing you.
Yes.
"It could be,"
"Eat sometime, Excuse me, I need to announce my name"
Laxminarayan!
"Sir, I didn't came here to kill you."
I didn't came here to kill you.
"Sir, trust me, I didn't came to kill."
Then whom you came to kill?
"My friend worked in Jamie's Italian in Dublin, and you're given a list of words that you're supposed to say."
Them's proper posh chips.
"But, uh, he was selling a pizza to someone, and you were told to say, ""Do you want me to pimp that for you?"""
Ohh.
"And it was like an old lady who was like,"
"""Hire it out for sex work?"""
That is so Jamie.
"What do you think, do you like him, Ellie?"
I do quite like him.
"It's nice to have someone, cos I'm from Essex, someone else from Essex who isn't just famous for being, like,"
"""Oh, you're mugging me off!"" So that's quite nice."
"He's got a trade, and I like that about him."
I'm from Essex as well.
Are you?
"Yeah, if that helps at all."
You're really ruining the image.
There was literally like a gasp from the audience.
Whereabouts are you from?
Billericay.
Shut the front door!
"No, where are you from?"
Brentwood!
No!
"Oh, my God!"
That means we're going to have to fight.
"I was worried where that was going to go there, Richard."
"To be fair, the size of her, I reckon you could reach from there!"
DAVID:
"My, um..."
Wow!
There's a good chance they're talking about fighting.
Maybe they're talking about fighting.
"Oh, yeah, I know that."
"Me, on the other hand..."
The doctors say you're going to be fine.
Although you're going to have to wrap your head around the fact that we're really brothers now.
We're blood brothers.
You donated blood ?
"Ah, I had an extra few pints flowing through my veins."
It was no big deal.
Hmm.
You're not a big fan of needles.
"Nor of fainting, it turns out."
But the bank was a little low and us O-negative guys got to stick together.
Hmm.
"That's weird, 'cause all of a sudden I have this strange urge to listen to Death Cab and read comic books."
Really ?
"No, I'm kidding."
"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause if we could have turned this into a body-swap comedy, we could have squeezed another year or two out of this."
Mm.
"So listen, I don't know if I've said this at all today, but..."
You did.
"But after all the times you've saved me, I was up, so..."
All right.
Where's everyone else ?
"How are, how are the girls ?"
"Kirsten, Sandy ?"
"Uh, the girls are fine."
"Veronica Townsend and Pancakes, however, have matching casts."
And Frank is here with Julie and Caitlin.
"He gave me a ride, brought you here."
"Um, but my mom and dad are doing some tests with the doctor, 'cause she fell."
Is it bad ?
"Hey, boys."
"You're digging your own graves, you fools!"
"You do what we tell you, or you're digging yours."
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOT]
"Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling."
"You haven't got the nerve, Dale."
You can't get away with this.
You'll spend the rest of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.
"Ten seconds or 10 years, the answer will always be the same."
"Listen, you dirty rats in there."
"If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,"
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!
"Is that right, warden?"
Did they kill Pollard?
Never mind.
Don't open the gates.
Get on the phone.
Call for extra help.
"We have, warden."
"It's on the way, sir."
"This is it, Armstrong."
Don't you need the warden to make 'em open up the solitary?
"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
"I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep with Stacey, and you're opening it up for him."
You're heading for the Hole.
Not a chance.
[MEN CHEERING]
"Get them keys, or I give it to Lang on the spot!"
"All right, men, all right!"
All right!
I'll open up.
"When you want a story, all you have to do is ask."
Bye.
Don't you want to get out of the box?
Can you tell me a story?
People story or animal story?
Happy or sad?
"A thriller, comedy or horror?"
Made-up or real?
A story about people.
Your story.
Mine?
- Don't you have a story?
- Sure.
- Can't you tell me?
- I guess so.
"I was born, and I had a lot of brothers."
My mother used to tell us stories so we should not think about eating.
"Then I grew up, got married and had a bunch of children."
I told them the same stories my mother used to tell me.
"I grew old, my husband died and one by one, my kids went away."
So I kept reciting stories aloud to myself.
I told them in the streets.
Some of the passers-by liked them and gave me some change.
"One day, your grandma came up to me and asked:"
"""Would you tell your stories to my grandchild for food and shelter?"
"She said I could eat myself sick, if I wanted."
"I agreed, so they put me in that box."
"Before they closed me up,"
I asked if I'd get paid on the spot.
"""Once my grandchild opens her present, you can eat,"" she said."
"Well, that's my story."
May I eat now?
"Do you think Tarbuck's a feminist, then?"
"Lesie Crowthery, Eddie, Lesie Crowthery."
Just another one of the great guys that make up my showbiz gang that I belong to and you don't.
"Now, shut up, I'm telling you the great anecdote."
"- ""Lynchy lined up to tee off. """
- I wish you'd tee off and let me smoke my fags in peace.
"""Lynchy lined up to tee off and said to me,"
"""'Gosh, Tarbo, we swigged so much pop last night,"
"""'being great guys together and such great big showbiz mates,"
"""'that I bet I miss this next shot. '"
"""And blow me down but he did."
"He missed it. """
"Oh, oh, oh."
Ha ha ha ha.
"Oh, ha ha!"
"Oh, touché, Tarby."
"Oh, that was brilliant."
"No, the same thing has happened to me fumfty times."
We-hell.
I can see it's gonna be a scintillating evening with everyone cracking brillo gags like that one.
Yeah.
Hey.
Maybe there's a series in it.
Dinner At Richie's.
An ultra-sophis chat show.
Good evening.
This is the BBC.
"Tonight, Sir Richie Rich will be talking to the Queen, the Pope and, of course, the Tarby."
It'd be a disaster.
You'd get drunk and make a pass at the Pope for wearing a dress.
Bloody good telly though.
"So, what incredible 12 courses will you cook for your fantastically amiable showbiz chums?"
"Unh-uh!"""
"""I'm from Brooklyn."
"""I'm from do-or-die Bed-Stuy Brooklyn."
You took my spot.
"I don't play that."""
"The lady was like, ""So?"
"I'm from Oakland."""
"My mom said, ""Y'all get in the car."""
"I said, ""Wait a minute, Mama!"""
You supposed to fight her!
"Don't be a punk!"""
"She said, ""Baby, I'm not a punk."
I'm a survivor.
"That's what the hell I am."""
"You don't mess with people from Oakland, folks."
You just don't do it.
"Even in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you notice they went over that Golden Gate Bridge, but they did not mess with the Bay one?"
Did you notice that?
"'Cause there would have been far more dangerous creatures on the other side, just waiting for 'em like,"
"""Hold on, bruh."
"""Hey, yo, who these Flavor Flav-looking niggas, bruh..."
"""coming over here with these ashy knuckles, nigga?"
"Who the fuck are these peop--"" The movie wouldn't have been called Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
It would have been called The Apes Died in Oakland.
There would have been no sequel.
Don't do it.
"Apes were gangster, man."
You ever had a gangster situation just happen to you?
"Like you, right here."
"She's like, ""No."""
"""I was at the HM the other day,"
"""and I switched the $4.95 tag"
And I'm still waiting on the reply.
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.
Fine.
Go !
"Frank, hi, it's Julie."
I hope you're okay.
"Caitlin and I are fine, I mean, we're trapped at the ice cream store on the pier, but we're fine."
I guess help is probably on the way.
"Okay, well... take care, bye."
"Look, I understand why you keep on calling Summer and the Cohens, but why Frank ?"
"I mean, weren't you guys supposed to take it down a notch ?"
"Caitlin, just because we're pulling things back a little bit doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about each other."
"I'm sure wherever Frank is, he's worried about us, just like I am about him."
"And I am about myself, because we're stuck here with him."
"The back door is stuck, too."
Looks like there's no way out.
We're trapped.
Figures.
We can't just sit here waiting to be rescued.
Totally.
"No, we should start eating all the melting ice cream."
I want a gold medal ribbon on a...
"Sugar cone, I know."
"Creepy, but convenient."
"Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping."
"It's Gary, my name."
Okay.
"I'm thinking the roof, or where the roof used to be."
"Ice-cream guy, got a ladder ?"
You can't climb up there.
"I'm not going to, you are."
I remember that a little bit differently.
Your parents didn't want you hanging out with me when I was pregnant.
Right.
But they came around eventually.
"Of course, I don't think you're their favorite friend."
Madison is.
Madison slept with your boyfriend.
But she didn't get pregnant.
And my parents like her parents.
"My parents like your parents, too."
"I don't think they'd go away on vacation with your parents or anything, but... (SIGHS)"
This sounds negative when all I wanted to do was say
I'm happy for you that Kathy made some friends.
"Now, I have to go meet Madison."
Why can't I go meet Madison?
Uh... 'Cause we're looking for guys?
(SIGHS)
Hi.
"Hey, Grace."
Hi.
"Um, I don't guess that you'd maybe want to do something tonight, would you?"
Tonight?
Yeah.
My mom wants us to try to be friends.
"Oh, yeah, I think my dad wants the same thing. (CHUCKLES)"
"Um, but, I mean, you've never not been my friend and I've never not been your friend."
"We haven't been close, but we haven't not been close."
"Right, yeah."
And I owe it all to you that I have a job at the church nursery.
I'll always be grateful to you for that.
Thank you.
"Although, being grateful is not quite the same as being a friend."
"Now, I liked Eddie and I want to help you, but you got to help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$ 10,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't..."
"- That's a lot of money, what've you got?"
- Who are you?
"Marybeth Cogan, Detectives Endowment Association."
I represent the Santos family.
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino so he could give up what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag but also to fill it with things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station because we are almost there.
"Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal."
"But then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window."
Tell me who sent you!
It was Varrick.
"Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!"
I think this is our cue to exit.
Where do you think you're going?
It's a knockout!
They're falling back.
Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the north.
Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.
"I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming."
"Actually, someone did."
Remember Mako?
You've got a great officer on your hands.
He's one of the best.
Mwah!
I can't believe my boyfriend is a real-life hero.
Boyfriend?
"Wait, stop."
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You really are as dumb as those rocks.
Of course we're a couple.
"Bolin, you saved the president."
And you proved Mako was right all along.
We have to go tell him what happened.
Yeah.
"Oh, you meant right now."
- President Raiko...
"- Avatar Korra, what's wrong?"
"Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed."
Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore.
"So, off the line. 200bhp and a feather-light body on a dry track."
This should be fast!

This car was designed by Lotus.
"So was our track, so it should be brilliant here, as he goes through Chicago..."
Very tidy!
"Now, coming up to Hammer Head, this can catch out mid-engine cars but the VX has no problem at all!"
In the first sector this car was level-pegging with the BMW.
Can it beat the BM?
"Come on, Stig!"
He's crossed the line!
That is...
Quicker than an M3!
That is an amazingly good car.
"Now, we've got one minute left and James has to use that time to get that caravan past the speed record."
I've been looking at the Guinness Book Of Records.
"It doesn't say that I have to use a car to tow the caravan, so I've decided to rely on the most powerful engine in the universe - gravity."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER
Do you know something - who'd like to see that again?
Yes!
Yeah.
Oh!
Ooh.
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Look at that!
"I'm not sure that was faster than 125mph, but I don't care!"
"Absolutely don't care, and on that flimsy, fibreglass bomb it's time to end the show."
Bye!
This is Armed Forces radio reporting from London.
I love New York.
"Doing a show here, man."
"You know, 'cause sometimes I do shows in weird places."
"Like, I just came back from Seattle, Washington."
That place is weird.
"'Cause Richard Sherman is there, and I'm scared of that guy, okay?"
"'Cause he's so forceful for no reason, right?"
"""Well, when you put me up against"
"""a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's what you gonna get!"""
"I said, ""Calm down."
"It's not that serious."""
"Ladies, let me tell you something."
"That's the type of dude, if he say you in a relationship, you's in a relationship."
There's nothing you can do about it.
"He walk right up to you, ""You coming with me."""
"You say, ""Bitch, I guess I'm going with him then."""
"""Fuck it."
"That's my baby now."""
"I'm serious, man."
"Oh, boy, it's so diverse in here."
I love it.
Ten Black people.
Thank y'all for coming.
It's--
"You aware that we are seriously a minority right now, and it's-- And it's cool."
"You know what, 'cause I love white folks."
"You gotta understand, I do."
"You know, 'cause when I first moved to New York,"
I moved into a dangerous neighborhood.
"And when I saw y'all walking around,"
I felt safe.
"'Cause I know when it all come down to it, y'all would get robbed before I will."
Watch the hands.
The hands tell you everything.
"I stand corrected, and... disturbed."
Okay... what about our cranky friend over there?
"Sum him up for us, Tony."
Cranky car salesman.
Lonely childhood.
Behind on his quota.
Regretting his life choices.
Not a couple.
And not familiar to either of you?
"Geez, Ellie, let it go."
"I'm trying, but..."
he's right there.
"You know, Tony, I don't mean to pin this on NCIS, but Ellie became much more suspicious about people since she joined you guys."
That is so not true.
"Oh, you really like talking bad guys."
"Well, I have to talk about something, since we can't talk shop anymore."
"When we were both at NSA, we'd debrief every night after work-- but now that he's restricted from telling me anything, all I can do is talk about what we do every day."
Chase bad guys.
"So I get where I may seem more suspicious, but..."
I'm not.
"Hey, why don't I get us some coffee."
"Well, there's Dirk, if it's a boy, obviously, or Oskar, with a ""K."""
Oskar Palmer-- that's a lot of R's.
Hmm.
"If it's a girl, we're thinking, uh,"
"Freda, Greta, Liesel-- something sort of Von Trapp-ish."
"Come on, McGee, up and at 'em."
Workday's over.
We're talking baby names and snow angels.
Can't right now.
Maybe you're right.
Ice cream and bowling.
Let's go!
Miley.
"I'm sorry, maybe you can deal with this but..."
Please don't say it.
...I can't.
So you're just gonna walk away from us?
"As long as there's two of you I don't think there can be an ""us""."
[Sighs]
You know dad I really thought that Jesse was different.
I thought he could handle all this.
Ah you just gotta give the boy some time Mile.
"If he really loves you, he'll be back."
"If he really loves that pretty boy face of his, he won't be."
Daddy.
Oh I'm sorry honey.
I just hate seeing you this hurt.
Truth is whether you're ready to hear it or not if he comes back that's great.
"And if he doesn't, there'll be other boys."
I keep praying there won't be but there always are.
I don't know.
Maybe I should just give up guys for good.
Oh now you're just teasing me.
Honey the truth is life has a funny way of working things out.
"One door closes, another one opens."
All you've got to be ready to tell yourself is...
[Screaming excitedly]
When your daughter asks if her best friend can live with you.
Think about it for more than a second.
[Continues screaming]
And then say no.
- And a little bird-watching as well.
If you're lucky.

Restricted area this side.

"The man, codename: the Needle."
Also known as Henry Faber.
"He was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called Öln in West Prussia."
At the age of 13 he went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden.
"Two years later, he was transferred to the more prestigious Groß-Lichterfelde near Berlin."
"He already spoke fluent English because his father, Baron von Müller-Guder, had worked in Washington as a military attaché, and had sent his son to private school there."
"But back in Germany, the boy rebelled constantly and was often flogged for it."
He passed his final exams with extremely high marks.
"In the '20s, the Needle was a cadet at the war school in Metz, and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him."
"In '31, Hitler visited the family estate and met him."
"In '33, Hitler came to power."
The Needle was made a captain and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties.
He had an affair with a German actress.
He never married.
He made no close friends.
"And in '38, the Needle disappeared."
God.
Clever bastards.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- And who might you be?
- I should be asking who you are.
You're on my boat.
- What's in that bag?
"- Binoculars, camera, reference books."
"No, you don't."
"Judy, Clarence saved your life."
"Don't you know Clarence, your old buddy?"
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, come in please."
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"Yes, Paula, what is it?"
"Well, it's Judy, Dad, she was attacked by a leopard."
"- Well, was she hurt?"
"- Well, not really."
"Clarence chased the leopard away, but there's still something wrong with Judy."
"It's as if she's in shock, Dad."
I'm frightened.
She doesn't recognize me.
"Well, Paula, she's just probably playing games."
She doesn't even recognize Clarence.
"Dad, I think you better get back here and have a look at her."
"Paula, you know I can't do that."
We have to locate Sally.
Judy needs you more.
"Now, uh, Paula, I'm sure Judy will snap out of it."
"Right now, Sally holds the answers to a lot of information the space agency needs."
"Well, I don't care about Sally."
Judy's in terrible trouble and you're chasing some silly astro-chimp around the bush.
"Ah, now, listen, young lady, get a hold of yourself."
"You're not doing Judy, yourself or anyone any good by getting hysterical."
"Now listen, does--does Judy have any physical injuries?"
I'll check.
There's no visible wounds or broken bones.
"Well, does she have any muscle paralysis?"
"I'll tell you what, test her reflexes."
All right.
"does this mean ""no""?"
'cause i love you.
"- oh, wayne, you only love me because we live in this crap town."
"but when you get to where you're going, you're gonna find somebody that you deserve to be with."
you don't deserve to be in a trailer park.
you're gonna do big things in this life -- important things.
- you really think so?
- i know so.
"okay, so i have one more gift for you, but you have to turn around."
- hey!
"- well, now you're all ready for college!"
"come here, wayne."
merry christmas.
- oh. excuse me.
"excuse me, miss?"
[chuckles] yeah.
i-is the salon open?
- c-c-can you see that we're in the middle of something?
"- cind, you might want to... ma'am, i apologize for her."
she can be a tad on the abrasive side sometimes.
but her heart's in the right place.
- look at you using all these big college words already.
- i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to intrude.
"i just wanted to know if the salon was open, 'cause i wanted, you know, a redo or a rebirth."
"- you know, i've heard all the stor-  hey, listen, i really don't need to hear your life story, okay?"
"can you come back in an hour, and i'll fix that mess?"
- okay. an hour.
- [chuckling] cindy.
- what?
- you should be nice.
[sighs] merry christmas.
"I still have to put her medicine in her food, but..."
... she's60percentimproved.
That problem with her fatigas.
Excuse me?
The dog's fatigas is better now.
That problem she had.
Was that a euphemism?
"Oh, boy, here we go with the Latin."
"You know, the fatigas."
It's like the female private parts.
"Boy, I tell you, I'm sweating up a storm here."
You're just a little nervous.
I'll come clean with you. I haven't had sex sober in about 20 years.
"You're not gonna scare me off, Andy."
"I know what you were like, and I know what you're like now."
And I think you're a good man.
"And in your own way, very charming."
So you want to hit the sack?
I'd like it if you kissed me.
I'm getting a new bed cover.
I've got it on order.
-Wanna fold that up or--?
-Sh.
"You realize that if I don't hold up my end, so to speak..."

Here...you will have to do this part of the work.
I swear...if I had a physique like yours I would have bowled over all the girls in India.
"In such a big place, where could Kania have hidden the fake currency printing dyes?"
Bobby.
"And you know I love me some Bobby Cobb, but the guy who sees a half-eaten taco on the beach and says, ""Sand snack, score!"""
Is not exactly the ideal financial partner when you have a baby.
- Maybe you could say something to him.
- Relax.
Travis is nothing like Bobby.
"I mean, sure, he has the Cobb instincts, but he uses them in much smarter ways."
50 broken coffee sleeves-- score.
"There's no music class this week because Stan's daddy is, um..."
"Well, he's going through some things, so we don't have a music teacher."
- [ Door closes ]
- You do now!
Who?
"Oh, uh, I'm Grayson."
"Um, yeah, uh, Stan's mom's best friend's husband."
His eyes are so tiny.
[ Laughter ]
"So, the city council just stripped you of your mayorship out of the blue?"
They said I lost public support.
How could that have happened?
You did fall asleep a lot in those town-hall meetings.
My chair was too comfortable.
"And at that ribbon-cutting ceremony, you accidentally cut that guy's finger off with the giant scissors."
His doctor sewed it back on.
[ Sighs ]
"I've lost my Bobby, lost my job."
Now I've lost my mayorship.
I have nothing.
There was the scandal over your leaked Dick pic.
That was a picture of me with a guy named Dick!
That headline was misleading!
- Boom.
"If anyone gives you drugs, take them, but do not take them."
Do you understand?
"And I will look both ways before I cross the road, and I will floss after every meal, and I'll wear a sweater just in case it gets cold."
I'll be fine.
"Well, you better be or I'm going to kick your ass."
I'll meet you back here at midnight.
I have to run an errand.
Hey.
Aww...
Did Mike stand you up?
"Vicki, if you're here to grill me again, I just..."
"Listen, Coreen's going to go undercover tonight and I need someone who can blend to the Goth scene, keep an eye on her."
I can't.
Not tonight.
"Henry, there are two men dead and I think there's going to be more."
I need your help.
"And I'm working on something that could prove to be just as dangerous,"
- for both of us.
- I know.
"That's why we should be working together, right?"
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Yes!
Just not tonight.
Okay.
Sure.
"Can't blame a girl for trying, right?"
"You know if you feel like it, we'll be at the Underground later ...you know, if it's not too much trouble."
"Christina, what do you want from me?"
I'm in.
Over.
"Aw, come on, Coreen, it's a one-way radio."
"Hey, have you heard the good news?"
Ellis wanted me to go back to Wales.
"And you what, you couldn't bear to miss the Blitz?"
I'm sorry.
"Well, at least Parfitt will be relieved."
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but then he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you'd found yourself in a similar position, what with your husband's Spanish War wound and all."
Should I...
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?
"And how would that help, losing you?"
Who the bloody hell else do you think's gonna be writing the slop?
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
You're doing a good job.
"Hello, Catrin."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ellis?
I just saw Perry and Conroy.
You had friends over?
I got a letter.
"A commission to document bomb damage in the provinces, and an exhibition in London straight after."
- The National Gallery.
"Oh, Ellis."
"Will there be Sunday trains, do you think?"
Only I'll need to get back to London on Monday mornings.
- What are you talking about?
- Coming to see you.
"Well, you'll be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course."
After the script is finished.
"Well, you can get out of that now, surely."
But I don't want to get out of it.
"Oh, wait."
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
No!
"You have got yourself a real prize there, young lady."
"I know, mom, he's a great guy."
He's more than a great guy.
He does whatever I ask him to do and eats whatever I toss up on the roof.
It's like having a big pet raccoon that can fix stuff.
Oh.
There's my hard-working man.
"Nice fit, huh?"
Two more pockets and I'm a pool table.
"Mike, why, why are you wearing my dad's clothes?"
"Oh, I gave him a bunch of daddy's stuff."
"You know, the last time he wore this suit, we were sharing a ""j"" at a Doobie brothers concert or sharing a doobie at an O'jays concert..."
I forget.
It was the Doobie brothers.
I found the ticket stubs and an ancient tootsie roll.
"Oh, daddy loved his tootsie rolls."
Can I see it?
"Well, the real memory is the ticket stubs, right?"
I'm kind of freaking out here.
"Mike, you don't have to wear that."
Why?
I think I look pretty good in it.
"You look like you should be standing in a field, selling green beans."
"Never mind her, you look great."
"Now, why don't you sit right down here at the head of the table?"
"We're having pot roast, mashed potatoes, and your favorite dessert..."
banana cream pie.
That's not his favorite.
"MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med."
"I mean, what do you have to worry about?"
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.
"Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition."
"You know, the 2.09 Competition?"
"Wait, no."
I'm building a car that drives by itself.
"Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year, so it's kind of important."
"Ben, let the car drive by itself."
"Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed."
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.
"Ben, you were born for this."
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
"- No, of..."
- No.
"You're one of my favorite new students, and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean."
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.
It's boxy.
It's blue.
How is that not you?
"So, how much is this thing gonna run me?"
"Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%."
The jacket's $589.99.
"- It was a reunion, and they were great."
- They're okay.
"A couple of years ago, Mom drove us in to shop."
"She couldn't find a good parking place, and all of the lots were total rip-offs."
So she kept making u-turns and cutting off taxis... and we were being screamed at in so many different languages... that we just turned around and drove home... and bought a Hummel at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.
Very adventurous.
I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.
"So I don't have the lingo down yet, but I have the attitude."
- You do?
- Yeah.
When I was getting a locker for my backpack... at the bus stop there was this guy just standing there staring at me.
"And instead of ignoring him, I fixed him with a really withering stare."
- That I've got to see.
- No.
Come on.
Let me see your withering stare.
It's dangerous.
I could hurt you.
- I've been hurt before.
- No.
I'm disappointed.
"- So, your arm's okay?"
- Yeah.
It looks worse than it is.
I like this Emily chick.
A friend of yours?
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?
I eat here everyday.
"It's nothing fancy, but..."
"Whoa, slow down."
"Ok, maybe not that part, as long as we're a couple and I'm her father, I guess, because I love her... and you too, obviously."
"This is unfair, Michael."
"Your life is so hard right now,"
- and I swear I can help with that.
- I can handle things.
- I've been handling things.
"- I know, I know, I know, but I can help with Sophie or cooking or whatever."
I don't want you to have to take care of me anymore.
I wanna help take care of you.
"And if I don't,"
- you can kick me out.
"- Ok, stop it."
"I do not need a father for Sophie and I do not want to get married, oh my God!"
"Ok, that's a bad choice of words and I'm sorry."
"But... child care, yeah."
"And cooking, maybe."
And then...
Maybe we could see what happens.
One step at a time.
Thank you.
You start early.
I'm a professional.
"What I mean by that is I start work early, but I also go home at 5 pm."
I dreamt I fired you last night.
I have that dream quite often.
You'd know that if you transcribed my dictation.
"In these dreams, would I be a projection of some aspect of your personality?"
"Your professionalism, maybe?"
Is that what you were firing?
"I'm not a doctor, but..."
Sometimes dreams are just wish fulfillment.
He didn't say anything interesting at all.
- Huh.
"- So, after 30 years, my dad finally had a chance to sit across from the man who was running everything."
And you know what he saw?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing special.
My dad realized in that moment he could have been that guy sitting behind that desk.
But he realized it too late.
"We're all just a bunch of guys, Joe."
Some of us believe that we could do anything.
And some of us believe we can't.
"So, when you ask me why I wanna do this, my answer is because I know what guy I wanna be."
What about you?
"( clears throat ) I definitely don't wanna be the guy that just lets the clock run out, you know."
I definitely do not wanna be the guy who just sits there while time fucking stands still.
I wanna be the guy.
- The fucking guy?
- Yeah!
"Yeah, the fucking guy."
Then let's get the fuck out of here.
( chuckles ) Holy shit.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

You hustled me.
"Yes, I did."
"For that, I'm sorry."
"You see, I sell video games, Sctanley."
"And this one here, in particular, in fact."
And I'm proud to stand here before you and tell you it brings me as much happiness as it does for the people I provide them to.
"And we had a bet, and I know that you're a man of your word."
Forget that you saw me and my friends and point me in the direction that I seek.
I cannot confirm or deny that the one that you seek is on the singles' side.
But a bet is a bet.
And I will tell you how to get there.
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.
No more boats for me and my friends.
I go by foot.
I would be remiss if I did not advise you to wait until daylight.
Do not take this journey lightly.
Hmm.
"There is an old game path through the forest, just beyond the abandoned Starbucks."
Take it to where it forks.
Jog to the right.

"hen the most important thing for us at that stage for some reason, in our minds, was:"
What are we gonna wear?
So ridiculous.
e hadn't even thought of a name.
We didn't even know if we could sing together.
"NiaII did say, ""We all need to dress a bit like Louis."""
NiaII looked at Louis' shoes.
He was quite cool.
""" I Iike his shoes."
"We should wear his shoes."""
Green polo.
We like those jeans.
Let's all wear those jeans.
I Iook back on it now.
If we'd have dressed like that.... e first got together at Harry's dad's place.
e did not know each other at all.
e'd get together and sing a few songs in the nighttime around the campfire.
e were meant to be rehearsing but we actually ended up playing football.
Most of the time we just spent having a laugh really.
e were lik e.

One Direction.
Love you!
Outside the studio they've only sang once.
here's now 200 fans.
"And I thought at the time, ""This is unusual."
"This just doesn't happen after one performance."""
The crowds were starting to build outside the studio.
"Harry, get a picture with me!"
I'm really afraid that our son is going to... be on those dating apps and that his profile pic will be him wearing those new year's glasses where the numbers are the eyes.

"Or, um..."

I got stuck on another awkward date last night.
"It's, like, you know in two seconds if the guy is wrong for you, but you still have to sit there through the whole dinner."
You need to try the website I'm on.
It keeps dating super casual.
I already tried It's Just Lunch.
It was still awkward.
I'm off that.

So is this considered our third date?
Because I brought my batting glove.

"Oh, God, that's good."
"You know, sometimes, I wish I was the funny one and you were the pretty one."
I think those two women are staring at us.
"Ugh, ignore them."
Those are the meanie moms.
They're awful-- all they do is judge everyone and gossip.
Should I step away?
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?
"Because if you'd rather be with one of the other grandfathers,"
I completely understand.
"""Oh, yeah, white,"""
"we can make Eminem, how 'bout that?"
'Cause y'all know he ain't fully white.
He got some Black in him somewhere.
"He is too angry to be a normal white guy, I'm sorry."
"Every time he raps, he sound like he want to kill somebody for no damn reason, don't it?"
"He be... ¶ I'm gonna take a bitch, put her in the trunk ¶"
¶ Drive the motherfucker off a bridge ¶
¶ Under the water.
¶ Wait for a great white shark to come ¶
"¶ Pop the trunk, there goes the bitch ¶"
"¶ Chum, chum, chum, chum."
"You need a hug, sir."
You need PBS in your life.
"You need Arthur, Mr. Mathers."
"But it's so crazy to see Eminem's evolution, right?"
'Cause how the hell do you go from rapping like this... ¶ I'm disappointed at my dentist appointment ¶
¶ They gave me the fucking gas for 30 minutes this morning ¶
¶ Walked in a hospital to get a chest X-ray ¶
¶ I walked out the next day.
¶ With a dress and a sex change ¶
"You're like, what?"
"How the hell did he go from that to... ¶ Oomina-lay-la, oogie-wala-wala ¶"
¶ Swallow the garlic.
"Garlic, he wants to make a pizza."
I get it.
I understand him.
"I like Eminem, man."
Eminem is dope.
I like lyricists.
I like people that actually rap.
"Kendrick, J. Cole, Drake,"
That's enough!
Stop this bullshit!
"We were talking quietly, and he comes and bugs us."
Come here.
Listen to me.
"Until you apologise, you don't set foot here!"
Understood?
"You don't understand, arsehole."
We found the garage thanks to Jésus.
"Now that we all agree the Mexican killed Karine and Célia, we need to find Niko, Tatiana's probable killer."
"We know he is a pimp, probably Albanian, with a scar on the cheek."
He has girls working near the Canal de I'Ourcq.
"Without Jésus, he will be difficult to identify, so keep your eyes open."
The Crime Squad should not have the info on Niko.
We're ahead of them.
We're pretty sure that Ronaldo taught Niko his MO to carve up Tatiana.
Niko could then tell Jésus how to mutilate her.
And Tatiana then becomes a victim of the Butcher of la Villette.
And Ronaldo gets freed.
- Niko and Ronaldo know each other?
Yes.
It's the only explanation.
But we're not 100% sure.
"Ronaldo had no visitors in jail, except his lawyer."
Now what's important is how to catch Ronaldo before he kills a new victim.
"He fooled the cops, the judge..."
He must feel invincible.
It's pretty certain he will do it again.
"Yes, but he's on the run."
And running isn't cheap.
"He needs money, documents."
He has no one else but Niko.
I can only take so much of this!
Are you going to drink your life away?
Go home if you're not going to drink with me.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
"I know you're hurt, but this is too much."
It's just a darn exam.
You never wore a scholar's robe before anyway.
Stay out of my life.
How could I?
Who are you to tell how to live my life?
Who am I?
How could you say such a heartless thing?
I'm your friend salt merchant Yim Chun-su.
"A friend, yes, we're friends..."
Come to think of it.
We make a fine pair.
You're a peasant's son and I am a traitors son.
We make a fine pair.
Are you done?
Is that why you're my friend?
Because you're poor and your grandfather was a traitor?
Are you saying you wouldn't have been my friend if you came from a rich and powerful clan?
Fine then.
Do what you want.
You can drink yourself to death for all I care!
Would you pour me a glass of that?
Is it hard to bear?
I'm glad.
I'm glad this happened to me and not to Yo-shin.
Ten years...
For ten years this river has been the source of comfort.
And in that time I had put it all behind.
She was just Fanny.
Fatimah Fareeeha Taarhira al-Amatullah.
Not at all like the kind of girl you'd meet back in Illinois?
"Actually, sir, not that different."
When did you find out she was a princess?
"When I asked her on a date, sir."
She told me she wasn't allowed to be seen with me in public.
And yet you spent time together anyway.
We used to meet at the Botanical Garden.
Nobody much went there.
We'd just walk and talk.
"While you were in Al Khair, the only time you had together were these few stolen moments?"
Mostly.
We spent a night together in a jeep once.
"Well, I'm sure the members get the picture."
"Not like that, sir."
I got an urgent message from Ops.
My mom was having an operation to diagnose a tumour.
It was my mom.
I felt like I was a million miles away.
Fanny held me all night.
"Just held me, till I could call my dad and know my mom was okay."
"Why do you suppose Fanny did that, petty officer?"
Because she loves me.
You're sure about that?
"Yes, I am, sir."
And how do you feel about her?
"I love her with all my heart, sir."
And so you broke these laws so the two of you could be together?
"- Yes, I did, sir."
- And you'd do it all again?
"No, sir."
- when he came to the Daily Planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
He was rattled the last time I saw him.
Desperate to give me something...
A locket.
What does a locket have to do with Lionel Luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
"When I was a boy... we took a trip together to Washington, D.C...."
It was just the two of us.
"I thought I was just tagging along on another business trip, but... he wanted to show me the Air and Space museum."
He knew I loved things that could fly.
We were looking up at the Apollo 11 command module.
I couldn't believe it went to the moon.
My father held my hand.
"And he told me, ""The right man, can make anything possible."""
You have his locket.
How did you get him to...
"Lionel was a cruel, sadistic man."
What are you suggesting?
No one will ever know.
I promise you.
Where's the key?
It was empty.
My father must have given it to someone.
I asked you to keep an eye on him.
Lionel stopped by the Daily Planet before going to Luthorcorp.
He was spotted in the basement.
Get the helicopter ready.
Of course.
You killed dad for a necklace?
You're not real.
"So, uh, when can we get started?"
"When Amanda goes back, I'll have time."
Okay.
Well... good-bye.
Bye.
Ready?
"Kyle, I can't go out."
But you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry.
I can't see you.
Amanda?
Inside!
This is all your fault.
What?
My daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
You're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
Drop out of the conservatory?
Why?
As if you didn't know you're the reason.
She didn't say anything to me about it.
We haven't even had a chance to talk.
You're not gonna get that chance.
"You will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school."
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
"Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction."
"I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay."
"Well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes."
"What I mean is, try to see things from her perspective."
"That music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss."
I don't want her to miss it.
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
Would you stop?
!
Why did you come looking for me?
Sarah...
I was fine.
I came because I wanted to understand why this happened.
"This happened because you and mom, you won't let me live my life."
"You think you can make decisions for me for the rest of my life, forever."
"No, Sarah, that's not true."
I want you to decide.
Right.
Decide to go to art school?
Yes.
"Yeah, so even there, you're taking the thing that I love, and you're..."
"You know I'm an adult, right?"
"And so, that means, for the first time, finally, finally, I can make my own decisions."
You can't control me.
I can do what I want!
"And right now, what I want is to get the hell out of here!"
Tom.
"Just, uh..."
just give me a minute.
Thank you... for taking me back there.
I know it was hard.
"Yeah, you know, I always assumed that it was the problems between marjorie and I that were to blame for what happened with Sarah."
And now?
"Well, now I know it was more complicated than that."
We were scared.
"We thought she was just messing around, you know?"
We thought she just didn't wanna grow up.
"When, in fact, that's exactly what she was trying to do."
"She accused you of wanting to make decisions for her, forever."
"When I first had Geneva, it was like..."
"I recognized her, you know?"
"I mean, she had Dave's smile, and she had my eyes, and..."
What is it?
I can't say anything right with Dave these days.
I thought things were better.
We haven't slept in the same bed in months.
"And ever since the wedding, it's--"
"He's been acting even more distant, you know."
It's like...
I don't understand.
"Something just changed that day, and I can't tell if I'm pushing him away or he's pulling away, or I..."
I don't know.
It's just all...
"You still love him, right?"
"Well... if I didn't, would I be crying at this stupid chick song?"
"Look, your marriage is worth saving, so you gotta stop talking and start doing."
"- Doing what, though?"
- Being there for him.
Being involved in what he likes and what he's doing.
"If it's work that's absorbing his time, get into it."
"If it's something he cares about, you gotta care about it, too."
- I do.
I do.
- Don't tell me.
Show him.
"I really like you, Suzanne."
I want to work things out with Deena.
Nobody's stopping you.
I shouldn't even be here.
"You have a lot going on with your marriage, the launch..."
So why not just be in the moment?
Do you have kids too?
Is your husband unemployed?
Did he mess up while doing business and ask you to bring home money?
What crazy person do you think would marry a beggar like me?
"If it were, would you do that?"
I don't have a husband and most definitely do not have kids.
"I don't have a house, money, or pride, so I'm living with my friend Na Ri."
So what?
"Because of a certain psycho, I got fired from my job, and I will continue to not have money, a house, or a husband."
Is it entertaining?
Is it funny?
Why do I even bother saying these kinds of things to you?
Crazy wench...
-SKYYoonproductionPD.
-Hello?
"-It's me, Yoon PD."
I think you will have to continue working on Sin Joon Young's documentary.
I thought you were switching me out for a different PD.
Sin Joon Young said that he would not film a single scene if you weren't the PD.
He said to cut back on all of the staff except for the production crew.
I think you'll have to come to the company to discuss it.
"You can come now, right?"
Hello?
No PD!
"No PD, are you listening?"
Hello?
"Ah, I'm telling you, it's urgent!"
♬  Hey boy!
♬
♬ Show me your love ♬
♬ You and I ♬
♬  Good morning.
"I don't like your manner, I don't like your style, I don't like your attitude."
But I do like your ideas.
"Stephens, I'm putting next year's entire campaign in your hands."
- You are?
- Yes.
We've been advertising the same way for 30 years.
It's not working anymore.
That's why I changed agencies decided we have to keep things up-to-date.
Get to work on that campaign right away.
"And remember one thing, gentlemen Waterhouse is my name and thumbtacks is my game."
He wants me.
"Darrin, you must have somebody watching over you."
"Larry, I just learned something."
"- When a man can't lose, he can't win."
- Where are you going?
"- To a bar, to drown my sorrows."
- Drown your sorrows?
You just landed a big account.
"Well, let's just say I'm a sore winner."
"Yeah, you came to the right guy for advice, Darrin."
I'm an expert.
I know everything about marriage.
That's why I'm still single.
I don't get it.
I'm married to a girl who can have anything in the whole world yet she chose me.
- Take my brother.
He's had four years of happy marriage.
"The trouble is, he's been married for 16."
She must love me.
Gave up everything for me.
But obviously she misses all those luxuries.
Who can blame her?
# Now stand by with your glasses All ready
# Drink a health to the men Of the skies... #
"Here's to the memory of a fine, brave man."
I remember the smile on his face as he went.
"What you trying to do, turn this into a wake?"
"If you two girls go and sit over there, I'll get your drinks."
"""Easy as falling off a log"" he said."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
Because he was a right guy.
He'd tell you to drink that beer instead of crying into it.
Let's have a game of darts.
You two go ahead.
I'm all right.
"I don't care for darts, maybe it'll make him more cheerful."
May I sit down?
It's a free country.
"Wow, that's a rousing welcome."
What did you expect a 21-gun salute?
"Make it 48, will you?"
I heard about this morning.
About Breton.
Let's talk about something else.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were like the others.
Scared inside and covering up.
"But you're not scared, are you?"
Sure I am.
No you're not.
You know what they say around here?
There are two types of men who jump.
Those who are crazy and those who are scared.
- I'm apologizing!
Has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
"Stan, listen to me."
It was my fault too.
"I tripped over the cable, I."
This is not about you.
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people."
Let's get that stage reset and make it look good.
"Big, big jackpot on monday."
- Garfunkel?
"- Yeah, I'm probably the biggest garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
That's not the...
point exactly.
Natalie's a human being.
"Now all this attention can throw a person off-balance, especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly."
"I once wrote a book on body language, and it... it spent all of three minutes on the best seller list."
"Now I was very young, and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
- I didn't like myself very much.
- So now you're on her side.
The question is why aren't you on her side?
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie's your friend.
Maybe you're afraid...
She doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
- So are we all right?
"- Yeah, we´re fine."
All right.
Let´s do this.
I got the high res on monitor two.
Tony.
Didn´t know I was gonna see you today.
You know what we want.
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
I already told Jack everything I know.
I want you to tell me.
"First Jack, now you."
What does that remind me of?
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?
"So, where do we look for Alvers?"
It´s a nice ring.
Who´s the lucky girl?
Hope you did a background check cos you don´t wanna make the same mistake twice.
You´re going back to prison.
There´s a good chance you´ll be executed as a traitor.
"You know if you cooperate you may be able to save your own life, but you´re stalling."
"Which means you know something and think there´s a play you can make, only now´s not the right time."
Very incisive.
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
Why don´t you tell me about Alvers?
All I know is that he works only with Amador.
I don´t know him personally.
All we´ve been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
He had an mri on one of his knees.
There´s a prescription for antibiotics.
Treated for hiv.
(rapid bleeping)
Yeah?
Ah!
"Thank you, darling."
You're welcome.
Keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped around my little finger.
Yeah.
"Says the guy who taught me to fly his crop duster when I was 13, then told Mom I was lying when I mentioned it."
I was so jealous.
"My mom knew that you let him fly, and she wouldn't let me go anywhere near you."
"You see, Jake would..."
Jake would come over and tell me all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
"He means the ""Nuts"" story, Grandpa."
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
"Tell me the story, somebody."
What?
It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
"The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines, and surrounded a division of Americans in a little town called Bastogne,"
"freezing and starving and running out of ammunition, but they knew that they had to hold that ground."
"Just before Christmas, the Nazis sent a note to the American commander telling him that he could surrender and save the rest of his men, or they could stay and fight."
"The American commander sent a one-word reply to the Wehrmacht commander,"
"Uh, sir?"
"Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now."
"I don't want to be, but I am."
If you don't come forward...
"I don't know, I might have to."
"Well, I guess we're each gonna do what we have to do."
"I can say anything to you, right, dad?"
"Well, this is the last thing you need to know,"
The thing you're never gonna get
To help me deal with.
"This thing that's been living inside me,"
"This cloud that I can't get out from under,"
"It's always been there, but it started to get worse"
During my senior year of high school.
Kim and I went to this party.
It was mostly college kids home for their christmas break.
There was a boy there.
His name was william.
"He was a little older, cute, funny."
"I liked him, so I pretended to be older."
He kept giving me drinks.
"I started to feel funny,"
So he asked me if I needed to lie down.
He helped me upstairs.
And the rest?
"Well, you're defending him now;"
you know what he does.
I was barely awake for any of it.
All I knew the next day
Was that something sick had happened to me.
"When I read about your case in the papers,"
"When I realized how many other girls he'd done it to,"
When has that every stopped you?
I need to connect more with Lucas.
I thought you guys were already doing that.
"I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far."
Can you help a girl out?
Yeah.
You know what?
Give him this.
Travis.
"Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him."
Great.
"Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?"
Just friends.
"I know, sorry."
You're a goddess.
Did you finish 'The Little Prince'?
"No, I just rented the movie."
This book is stupid.
"Nathan, you're not going to pass French if you keep renting movies."
"Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read."
"So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?"
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.
"Wow, what did you say?"
I didn't know what to say.
Nobody's ever asked me that question.
"Wow, that's really big."
"This last couple of weeks without it,"
I mean if I didn't play I might actually have a life.
- What would you do?
- I don't know.
At least I'd have some time to figure it out though.
"Besides, I'm sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?"
"And I'm a monster, too."
"But you're human, Kiefer."
"In here, I can rule as the king of the Kingdom of Afternoon Naps."
"Kiefer, go outside and..."
"Now I know why I fell for you, Ryner."
"Because you were so unmotivated, I never felt like I had to be cautious around you."
I could be at ease.
"That's what I thought, but I was wrong."
It's really because you're kind.
And... because you're strong.
"Ryner, you're no monster."
I guarantee it.
"Thank you, Ryner."
I'll live on.
"And mark my words, I'll..."
I'm going.
Open up.
That surprised me.
I thought I was going to suffocate.
What's wrong?
Are you injured?
A little.
"Are you a fool, volunteering to be imprisoned?"
It was hard getting a visitation here.
You didn't have to bother.
"I'm just being kept in a prison cell instead of a school, now."
When I close my heart
When I close my heart What's this?
When I close my heart I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
To the scent of impending darkness I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
"To the scent of impending darkness If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
"A refrain of a far-off day of resurrection If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
"Weird lights, strange phone calls, you."
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
"Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- That's not important.
"What is important, however, is that you tell no one."
That was the mistake that Jeremy's predecessor made.
I'II be in touch.
- Nice bunch?
- Mm.
(Man on radio) A suspected gas explosion wrought havoc in Little Stempington.
No one was hurt in The Wicker Barn but fire officers are counting occupants lucky.
"Got a space for you right here, Mrs HazIedine."
How do you know my name?
And isn't that a disabled parking space?
Don't you worry about them.
"Most of them are faking it, especially the ones in shopping scooters."
I make 'em park round the back.
Do that again and I'II piss in your petrol tank!
"Nobody hoots at Mrs HazIedine, you fucking fuck."
Now take your ration book and fuck off home!
It's quite all right.
I am holding up the traffic.
"Under control, Mrs HazIedine."
"When you've finished, give me a shout and I'II have someone load your car."
"Good morning, Mrs HazIedine."
"Peter Astbury, store manager."
"And this is douglas, your personal shopper for today."
"That'II be £8.50, please, Mrs HazIedine."
There must be some mistake.
"Oh, er, I'm sorry, er, that's er, 5... £4.20."
Just £4.
I'm very sorry.
There's about £70 worth of shopping here.
"""where moth and rust doth corrupt,"" Matthew, 6:19, but it's a handy little case is that."

Are you allowed to play it?
Yeah.

You can leave that.

I might put it in the bin.

[Ship's Horn Blows In Distance]
[Chattering]
"[Woman] Mr. Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York?"
"Uh, yes."
It's my first trip.
Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me... and, uh, the middle of the ocean is the only place... where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."
"Mr. Devereaux, do you agree with the recent survey finding... that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?"
[Man Speaking French]
- [Chuckles]
- To les femmes.
"[Man On P.A., Indistinct]"
Here's the rest of the warrants.
The court order's in there for the wiretaps.
Judge gave you 60 days on it.
Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"- Hey, look."
If this is the way you're comin' in on this... why don't you stay home and save us all a lot of grief?
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
"Bill, look."
Please...
Do me a favor.
Give them a chance.
He came in here with a little basic information.
I know you worked with him before.
"""Is it OK by you?"""
Oh!
"I know, it should have ended on a big laugh."
"But listen, we have a responsibility on As Yet Untitled to think of the title for the show."
"Every time I look at you now, I imagine you having sex in the woods."
Yeah!
I would say we go one better than that and we just say Queefing In The Woods.
Queefing In The Woods is an option.
Can you remember any of our conversation?
Bits and bobs.
I like...
What was your line for the judge?
"Where you go, ""Do you want to speak to the judge or do you want this?"""
Oh...
As a title?
For this show.
"It kind of gives the end game away, though, doesn't it?"
"""You can either sit with the judge or you can face this."""
"""You can face time or face this."""
You Can Face Time Or Face This.
What about Colour Me Orange?
I'd like to thank my guests -
"Grace Dent, David O'Doherty, Johnny Vegas, Sean Kelly."
You have been watching You Can Face Time Or You Can Face This.

"No, it's this thing with Alan Davies..."
"No, not QI."
He's doing something on his own for Dave.
I know he's got some massive tax bill.
This gets me out the house.
I only hope Alan's changed his hairstyle.
- Classic?
"Yeah, I have the money to spend on the really nice stuff, so I don't need to wear things that you bought at a garage sale for a dollar."
So you're still mad at me?
I don't need you to tell me that I should hire a nanny because I'm incompetent with your child.
- I never said that.
- You implied it.
It was your tone.
It was judgmental and... superior.
"If I said something that you took too personally,"
- I am sorry.
- That's the tone I'm talking about.
You know what?
"Can we please, please, please just go to the concert?"
We can argue in the car.
It's what Dave and I do.
you know this is... a work for me tonight.
Thank you.
"Since we're winding down with the game... oh, I didn't get you... the bow and everything."
"""Tin men"" and ""Avalon."""
"It's the rest of the ""Diner"" trilogy."
"Yeah, I know exactly what it is."
And this madness between us is a curse...
I don't wanna fight.
- I don't wanna fight either.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am sensitive because...
I don't know much about babies.
"Every time I hold one, they start crying."
"I mean, it's like they...can sense my fear."
It's not gonna be that way with your own baby.
I swear.
You'll be amazed.
"Driving a yellow convertible with the top down, dressed like assholes!"
Yo.
Yo.
"Yo, look, he has one of these things."
- Would you put that down?
"- No, you can hook up to the Internet."
You can play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!
on it.
King Hippo's going down.
Put that away.
Put that away.
"I can't believe you can even think about playing games at a time like this, man."
You realize what would happen if our parents found out about this?
You have sent our sons to Guantánamo Bay?
This is an outrage!
"You Arabs think you can just mix in with our peaceful society... and we're not gonna find you, huh?"
I am not Arab!
I am Indian!
"Look, Chief."
"I'm not here to argue seblantics with you, OK?"
I'm here to save lives.
Ask the Lees what they know about their son's terrorist activity.
"Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years."
"Now, frankly, I find this very offensive."
They're using some sort of dialect I've never heard before.
But I'm pretty sure he said something about going on the offensive.
"Tell them we know what their son is up to... and if they don't cooperate, he could be sentenced to death."
Hit 'em.
Yeah.
We know what he said!
"Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys."
He's supposed to be in medical school.
- I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
- That's what they do with killers.
- I'll see you around.
"- Come on, let's go."
"When I grow up, I'd love to have a pair of shorts like that."
"- How's your wife, Eddie?"
- None of your fucking business.
How would you know...
"You're his partner, how's his wife?"
"Eddie's picking on me again, Uncle Nick."
One of these days it's just going to be you and me!
Workers discovered the nude body wrapped in a sheet.
She was identified as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
"Miss Putnam, a stewardess, was abducted from her home,   then taken to another location, where she was murdered."
The brutal crime reminds many of the Polish Hillstranglings.
There's no connection other than the victim being a white female.
"The Polish Hill victims were strangled, not shot at close range."
- You picked the wrong house to rob.
- You got nothing worth stealing.
- It's been a long time.
- I could've killed you.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You did.
Give me a drink.
Why do you live on a houseboat?
You and your old man should've burned this place down.
- How was California?
- Sunny.
Sunny?
You're out there two years and that's all you can tell me?
"""The Simpsons"" are on an hour earlier."
Are you still mad at me?
What I really wanna do is just play basketball.
Basketball?
"I love it, always have."
I never miss a game on TV-- when my Dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"Dude, you should do that."
You should join the basketball team right now.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my Dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your Dad what you want."
Really?
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents."
Go to your Dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
"You know, you're right."
I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.
Sweet.
"Sit up properly, Bridon."
You know how strict your father is about posture.
"All right, dear, dinner's ready."
"Okay, let's eat!"
"Dad, I need to talk to you about something."
"Ooh, that sounds emotional!"
# What is it son #
# What's on your mind #
"# Whatever it is, you know your Dad has the time #"
"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
# If you can talk it you can sing it #
# You can lay down the rhythm and bring it #
Why should I wanna rise above it?
Because its standards are low.
Its people spend their time trying to drag each other down.
I don't want to be perfect.
I don't want to live in a test tube.
"I just want to be me, and have some fun, and have some friends."
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.
"By liked, you mean being pawed by an animal with one thing on his mind."
Don't make it sound like that.
"Everything has to be learned, even kissing."
And sex?
Is that what you're going to practice at your next party?
You keep trying to accuse me of things I'm not even thinking about.
I don't want you to get a reputation for a half-hour's carelessness.
I already have one.
The wrong kind.
"I want you to fall in love and at the proper time, to marry a man who respects you."
I want you to have a good name.
I want...
You want!
You want!
You want!
Is that all you can say?
"Well, if any man would ask me, I'd run away and become his mistress."
Don't you ever let me hear you say a thing like that again!
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said it.
Allison.
"Hello, Trudy."
"- Hello, Allison."
"- Hello, Joey."
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
"Then keep to it, if that's what's written."
Keep exactly to what is in the score.
Careful!
Here you made a mistake in the fingering.
This bar once more!
"Careful, a mistake in intonation!"
"The first mistake was at the beginning, these notes are long."
"This is a faster tempo, here we shorten the notes."
We'll speed it up a bit.
The other problem is this point.
"I couldn't practise much, we have visitors at home, I couldn't make so much noise."
"And could you let me go now, because the whole family is going to granddad's grave."
His brother's come.
What will you do at the cemetery?
I don't know.
Pay our respects.
This young boy has an id card.
"Everyone has, it can't be helped."
You must have some proof of identity.
She left it at home.
But they know me.
Haven't you got something from school?
You think I'm not fifteen?
Look how grown up she is.
"She is, that's not the point."
"If I've got an id card, she has too."
Must we always have it with us?
What's written on that board?
Young people under fifteen must show their id cards.
"Her age isn't written on her face, she must carry it all the time."
I always have to have it with me?
I can't help it.
His car number is MRX 4060.
"Sylvia, he alone is poised to win this year's derby."
"I'm sory Mr Daaga, Prakash couldn't deliver your gold to the right man."
Prakash?
Who Prakash?
I found your telephone number and address on him.
Are you talking about the Prakash who fell to death from a train?
"Yes, I remember. I read about him in the newspapers."
I am delighted to hear that you read newspapers.
But why did he keep my telephone number and address?
He could have told you.
Your misfortune.
He is dead.
The news of his death was a false news spread by us to cheat you.
He isn't dead.
He's alive and kicking.
He is alive?
And he has testified in the hospital itself.
"Don't you fret, Mr Daaga."
Prakash is dead.
I just wanted to see the change in colour ofyour face.
"These things are trivial, Inspector."
The court asks for evidence.
And as long as the police doesn't find any evidence against us it can't even shake us.
Little mouths don't open in front of elders.
Understand?
"Inspector Vijay, you have insulted my man."
I can sue you for this in Court.
"Well, Mr Daaga, you will have to produce evidence for this smack."
How can I help you in this matter?
Vijay is a close friend ofyours.
He is.
"They're justsoft, chicken-shit faggots."
They don't have the long-term vision anymore.
They justwantto covertheir ass and meet girls and tear each other down.
"Oh, God, this country's in deep, deep, deep trouble, Buddy."
"I have to see this through, you know."
Motherwould have expected no less of me.
"I'm sorry, Buddy."
"I justwish you knew how much I love you, that's all."
"Ittook me a long time to fall in love with you, Dick, but I did."
And it doesn't make you happy.
- You want them to love you.
"- No, I don't."
I'm notJack Kennedy.
"They neverwill, Dick."
"No matter howmany elections you win, they neverwill."
[Murmuring]
"Gentlemen, the president."
"All right, gentlemen."
This is our last damn leak.
It's no way to run a goddamn government.
We're going to prosecute the hell outof Ellsberg and any else who wants to leak.
"And, uh, that means anyone ofyou here who crosses the line,"
"I'm personally going afterthem, okay?"
The permissiveness ofthis year is over.
The belts are coming off and people are going to go to the woodshed.
'Cause the governmentcannotsurvive with a counter-government inside it.
I know howtraitors operate.
I've dealtwith them all ofmy life.
It's neverthe little people.
Little people do not leak.
"It's always some, uh, smooth son ofa bitch like Ellsberg."
"You know, the Harvard Hebrew boys... who leak."
- merry christmas.
"- and merry christmas, kids!"
"now, you guys... i know i don't say this enough, but i love you more than anything in this entire world."
and that's why i named you after some of my favorite things -- cheez doodles.
[baby coos] skoal.
brandie.
- but you didn't name me.
"- i know, but i still like brandie."
and i love you like you're one of my own.
"'cause family is very important, okay?"
family is all we really got.
"and, harley, my angel."
you know i've always loved you the most.
i'm just kidding.
i love all you guys.
but i love you.
and this is for you.
"- thank you, mama."
- you're welcome.
"- * noel, noel"
- it's just a little something.
"- i love it, mama."
"- oh, don't go bs'ing me, boy."
"it's, uh -- it's supposed to be like when you -- [sighs] when you don't have something, but it's like -- it's like it means something, but it's... help me."
you know what i'm saying?
- a symbol?
- yes!
a symbol!
dang!
wayne must have been teaching you while i was out doing... doing my thing.
"so, that is supposed to remind you of where you've come from, but not where you're going, okay?"
and that's probably me in there with my feet up on the recliner after a hard day at girl curl -- just lazy.
- Tropic Thunder.
- Shooting Tropic Thunder.
"He was like, ""You won't believe where I've been."""
"He said, ""I've been in the jungle holding my guts and carrying my intestines over my shoulders through the forest."""
"We're like, ""Yeah, right, buddy."""
"Well, now I know what he means because I've seen the film."
This was such a different role for him.
Didn't he keep saying...
"Kept being like, ""I'm not really an asshole."""
"Like, ""I'm not really like this."" He was so good at it."
He kept saying he felt really bad because he was manhandling me and being so...
It's a pretty obnoxious character.
- But he's so not anything like that.
- He did it really well.
"I felt like the fattest girl in this fake club here, because I was."
That's so stupid.
Look at how gorgeous you are.
"Well, because I was..."
My face was completely obscured in shadow just then.
"This was, like, the coldest night ever."
- This is as bad as it got.
- Poor Alexis...
- It's true.
"...who has, you know..."
"Weighs, like, 5 pounds and didn't have any clothing."
"Also, we were like on..."
- We were near the bay.
- And on the water.
- You were right on the Hudson River.
- Hudson River.
"It was, I don't know, 3 or 4 in the morning and it was probably about 5 or 10 degrees."
- This was the day...
- No.
[Grunts]
You'll never find them again.
What the hell?
[Growls]
[Breathing heavily]
He's not himself.
He's been acting weird.
"I'm just, you know, worried about him as to what he saw."
Has he said anything?
"No, but I can tell there's something not right."
Hank's got to be shook up about this in some way.
"You know, I mean whether he's talking about it or not, when I saw him looking up at me, he was freaked."
- Aah!
- [Groans]
"And it's a look I've seen before, let me tell you."
"I'm sure you're hoping it will just go away, and he won't say anything, but look."
"This is not, like, your ordinary nightmare, okay?"
He knows he was awake.
And his brain is trying to process the unprocessable.
"I mean, what did you think when you first saw one woge?"
[Snarls]
- I thought I was going crazy.
"- Right, well..."
"Hank's probably going through the same thing, you know?"
"You know, with you, it was one thing."
He was hit.
He was knocked out.
He was a little dazed.
"But I mean, he saw Brinkerhoff change."
That is so not going to make it any easier.
"Trust me, mental hospitals are chock-full of people who have spent their lives trying to wrap their minds around things they've seen and can't explain."
"Oh, yeah."
Lightning's ready
Ka-chow!
Get your antenna balls here!
"Go, Lightnin'!"
- Whoo!
"- You got that right, slick."
Uh!
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
"I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip."
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.
"Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof."
"If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!"
"Right, Darrell."
"Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season."
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.
"Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?"
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
"And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks."
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Chick thought this was his year.
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!
"You know, I don't think anybody expected this."
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.
But everyone knows him now.
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
"The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!"
"Three cars, one champion!"
No you don't.
You should be starting at the bottom.
"BOYD OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CENTER 155 LAFAYETTE STREET WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16"
I'm number 37.
I've been waiting for five years.
But the sicker ones keep moving up the list past me.
"You having any problems, Carmen?"
Not yet.
But I'd like to get off this thing and have a life.
"In Peru, you can get a kidney in 48 hours."
People line up around the block to sell them.
Surprised you're not on a plane right now.
I would be.
If I had 100 grand to pay for transplant.
"Here, I'll probably die waiting."
"I've been waiting seven years, and I'm sick of nurses and doctors and hospitals and praying."
Man of your means has other options.
Buy a kidney?
No.
I've had a good life.
No regrets.
I'd rather leave the money to my grandchildren.
But you'd know where to go if you changed your mind.
Everybody does.
We used to talk about it all the time in my dialysis group.
Can you give us a name?
"I could, but it would only be a rumor."
And I don't necessarily believe it's wrong.
Then why didn't you do it?
Because we spent 90 grand on our wedding.
There's nothing left.
Now she's gonna die because I can't even afford to save her life.
Staying positive is better for Kyle.
I got rights.
- I could do something about this shit.
"- Boy, please."
"The only rights that are important are a woman's right to choose, and I choose a life without you."
"Come on, Amber, that's cold, now."
- You wanna know what's cold?
- What?
- The truth.
"- Well, what's the truth?"
( scoffs ) Truth is you old as dirt for a wide receiver.
"I mean, maybe you have a couple of seasons left at best, but after that, who are you, hmm?"
"Just some lonely-ass, busted ex-football player with a couple of bucks."
"- Well, you wanna know the truth I see?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what truth you see?"
Tell me.
Hmm?
- I ain't even gonna say it.
"- Yeah, 'cause you're chicken shit."
"Look, 'cause I'm a gentleman, that's why."
'Cause you have nothing on me other than I was stupid enough to sleep with your sorry ass.
"You really going for it today, huh?"
Well done.
"I'm just keeping it real, Rick, just like you taught me."
"So, if you don't mind, I have some packing to do."
"Oh, you know what?"
Can you put this on the truck for me on your way out?
Thank you.
Uh...
"Hey, I'm gonna have the tuna tartare, and can you have 'em throw a fried egg on it?"
"Okay, fuck me, huh?"
Two hours late for the biggest meeting of our lives.
"I'll bid 25,000 at 145!"
Sold!
"500,000!"
Brady and morrison are unable to meet their obligations.
"Nathan, harken, and brown have failed!"
Martin and blake have failed!
Greenfield company- failed!
Tennyson and ames- failed!
"There's still no word from washington, gentlemen."
There hasn't been a share of stock sold on the exchange this morning.
Everyone's afraid to buy because they don't know what money's worth.
I've announced 78 failures with more to follow.
I hate to go back to my chair.
They've lost all sense of reason in the gold room- hundreds of madmen screaming at each other.
Wall street will be closed tomorrow because i don't see how we can stop fisk now.
Josie!
"Josie, look."
Gold is going up and up and up!
"In a few hours, i'll be as rich as a king!"
"We're not going to have a wedding, we're going to have a coronation!"
"Jim, will you let me talk to you?"
What's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
"Everything's wrong, jim."
Everything.
"Well, what is it?"
Tell me.
"Well, I- i've never tried to talk to you before about business, but- that's because you're nervous about me, like luke is."
"It's not that, jim."
It's what you're doing.
It isn't right.
You're only thinking of yourself.
"When I'm sad, they're here for me."
"Oh, my God!"
They're just genuine guys.
We love them because they sing our feelings.
They say what we want to hear...
"-...and no boys, no one, says to us."
-Yes.
They can't be real.
They make us believe that everything is possible if we believe in ourselves.
I know they love me.
Even they don't know me.
I know.
They have changed my Iife.
"It may sound cheesy, but they have."
"We love you, One Direction!"
I'm right in front row!
You sing!
"Here we go, O2!"
think our fans are dedication at its best.
hat they've done for us  in three years is just....
It's unheard of.
here was this group  of what called superfans.
And they were like promoters.
"Go on, spread the word!"
So start tweeting and I literally made it my Iife.
"I've sent like 1 6,000 tweets."
I was tweeting from Japan.
"hat was quite mad  watching our witter just gradually, Iike, keep totting up."
"hese girls are crazy about One Direction, and I've got no idea why."
I'm not a neuroscientist.
As soon as Directioners listen to music and find the music pleasurable what happens in the brain is that a neurochemical called dopamine is released and provides feelings of joy and happiness.
Shivers.
He must die in jealous.
And I must watch it.
What if our parents know it.
"I'll not tell, you too don't tell anyone."
I'll play with his life taking him to home.
"This bracelet was made in India, buyer's details are taken before selling it to them."
First find the jewellary shop.
"If you give this bracelet number, they will give the buyer's details."
"Kinsman, our children have agreed to marry, I'm very happy."
"Yes, I never felt so happy even when I made billions."
That's why I'm throwing this party.
"You said your son-in-law lives in Malaysia, where's he?"
They are also beautiful!
"Didn't I say, I'm Jiguru Jingania?"
"I didn't tell my name, right?"
'Run' Prakash Raj.
"Dear, didn't your short man come with you?"
What's this dad?
"All can't be tall like you, look down, dad."
"Have you come, son-in-law?"
"Why did you come so late, brother-in-law?"
What's this new get up?
That is...
"Kinsman, my son-in-law."
Nobody knows when I'll come.
Do you know why you're here?
Just a joke.
"Jokes apart, why did you change your name?"
That is...
"It seems you're here for a year, and refusing to go to India."
What's the matter?
I made an attempt to murder.
MONTENEGRO:
"Not enough to escape, but enough to give him some range of movement."
"If he pushed himself back onto the table, he could raise his upper torso, which made it possible for him to generate a whiplike motion."
And sever his spinal cord.
I don't know.
The man was once a priest.
And suicide is a cardinal sin.
It wasn't a suicide.
"Booth, the facts clearly indicate that it was."
"A sacrifice, it was a sacrifice."
"""Sacrifice""?"
He was trying to protect someone.

AUBREY:
"Look, so, um, sorry that I haven't been exactly present."
JESSICA:
"Oh, well, we've all been working hard."
"I haven't been that available, either. (chuckles)"
"No, I'm talking mentally present."
I've been distracted.
"Oh, yeah, it's-- it's about your father."
"No, I-I understand."
You must be worried about what happens when they find him.
I am.
It's not as cut and dry as I thought it was gonna be.
"Well, I'm glad you're seeing that now."
"(exhales forcefully) Look, there's something else that I've been thinking about."
I want you to know that...
They kidnapped Amanda because they wanted something from him.
"And when he didn't give it, they killed her."
And he never told anyone.
You think the senator's going to make the same mistake?
"No, I'm not going to let him."
But he's holding back and I want to know why.
I hear you're having a lousy day.
Now is not the time.
"Before you get the wrong idea, I liked McNeal."
He was the first politician I covered and the last one who came out clean.
That's good.
Maybe you should put it in his obit.
Maybe I will... if you tell me why you were with him when he killed himself.
That's a good question;
"you come up with an answer, why don't you give me a call."
"Speaking of calls, do you care to comment on this one?"
"Mom, it's Sara;"
I need to talk to you.
About Jeffrey.
"It's important, so call me as soon as you can."
Where'd you get that?
We both met with Sara's parents.
I guess they liked me better.
They'll get over it.
"The Senator and Sara-- the marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought, was it?"
Off the record.
On the record.
No one's is.
"Ice machine's ready, Cap."
How 'bout you?
"Last beers, boys."
You're dating nothing but swordfish for the next three weeks.
So you've thought about where you'll put everything?
Like the interior design?
Yes.
"Yes, I have, Peter."
If this was the kitchen...
I'd like there to be a little nook right over there by the window.
Like the booth of a restaurant.
And there'd be an island right where the light is hanging... and the island would have the stove in it... and a countertop on one side with tall stools under it.
My daughter would sit on a stool... so I could talk to her while I was making dinner or lunch.
What would you say to her?
I'd say...
"""Hi, baby girl."
"You are a precious treasure."""
"I'd live up there, if I could."
If there wasn't gravity.
Yeah.
But if you lived up there... then all this stuff... all this stuff in my room... would fall down on you and crush you... and you'd die.
Ellen would have been so proud of you.
"Isn't it amazing, Ellen?"
Yes.
I'm so glad you took me here.
It was a whole civilization.
Two Mayan people in love... probably stood right where we're standing now and thought...
"""Look what we have built together."""
"And now they're gone, and so is the city."
And there's just... us.
I am done.
That was great.
- Eldercab.
- Hi.
- I'm feeling too old to drive.
- Yeah?
"Come on, Magnum."
"Go, Magnum, go.!"
Hit it!
Remember.!
Knees to chest.!
"Chop-chop, chaps."
To the van.
Come on.
I was dying.
"Everything confirmed it... my lungs, my head, my aching muscles."
"So, I concentrated on Roger."
I tried to think of all the reasons Roger didn't leave the island... when he knew the mafia and the feds were on his tail.
It came down to either a great love for Babs... or he couldn't get his hands on the money.
Yeah.
I settled on the money too.
"I thought of all the ways it might be tied up... investments, stocks, gold, land... ways that would take a while to liquidate."
After 26 miles...
I decided it was none of the above.
"He'd hidden it somewhere, and he couldn't put his hands on it immediately."
"By the time I got on the bicycle, I was ready to fall over dead."
I'd never make a hundred miles.
There was no way.
Not even if I concentrated on Roger and his problem.
Impossible.
But I had to try.
Beauty Knows No Pain.
He'd hidden the money.
He had to.
"The statute of limitations was almost up, but he couldn't get it because... it was inaccessible."
I had it.
I had the answer.
"Only I was so damn tired, I couldn't pull it out of my brain."
Mm-hmm.
Just came by 'cause I need a little favor.
None of your favors are little.
"Okay, you know what?"
I'm done flirting.
I'm not in the mood.
"I got to get in touch with that guy you told me about, the smuggler -- Schmidt was his name."
The guy you said could move anything or anybody.
Why do I tell you things?
Why?
"'Cause I think deep down, you like me."
No.
"No, that's not it."
"Okay, look, the point is, we got to get out of town with fresh I.D.s, okay -- someplace warm, with decent beer."
That's why we need Schmidt.
"W-well, I'm sorry."
"Your timing sucks, okay?"
Schmidt's in hiding.
He's in some sort of trouble.
"No cell, no e-mail, no nothing."
"You know, it's funny -- I bet the guy who builds his computer systems could find him."
"Say, wasn't that you, Dixon?"
Even if I could -- and I'm not saying that I can -- there is zero chance that he'll talk to you.
"All right, Dixon."
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Really appreciate it.
"But, you know, before I go, I thought I would just say"
I think it's great that a company like this would hire a convicted hacker!
Should I go on?
Shh.
"How about the Navy, when they almost court-martialed you for stealing the skipper's porn collection?"
It's just... it's never gonna end until we stop her.
"Look, Bastion employs 130 people."
I can't endanger their livelihoods if I can fix this in one night.
Right.
You're right.
"If she wants you to help her organize and find a location, that's a small price to pay."
When's the last time we did it in front of the mirror?
Grace... she didn't just come over to talk about the location.
Her name is Audrey.
She's going to be my date.
She's beautiful.
I'm sure you'll show her a good time.
You gonna jump?
Oh!
"You know, with my luck,"
I'd end up surviving the fall and end up eating my food through a straw the rest of my life.
You sure you should be smoking?
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you freaking kidding me?
A heart attack would be fantastic right about now.
Can I turn this off?
"Look, everything's going to be fine, Victor."
I just need you to show me every illegal transaction that you've made.
"I promise you, it will only stay between us."
Are you wearing a wire?
Huh?
What the hell is the matter with you?
"You're with them, aren't you?"
The SEC.
They got you to cooperate.
"Victor, I'm here to help."
All right?
Hmm.
I wasn't ready to do the kind of dancing she wanted to do.
Wow.
High school me would've hated high school you.
"If we're doing this, we should do it right."
Chaperones are prom secret service.
"It's like I keep trying to tell you, Boo-- stop talking to me."
"Look, tonight won't be so bad."
All we have to do is stand around.
I'm gonna act like I did at my own prom--
I'll be aloof and above it all and judge everyone.
"- You'll seem different, but not."
- Yeah.
"Guys, none of us are gonna take this that seriously--"
I now take that back.
"[ To tune of ""Bridal Chorus"" ] ♪ prom, prom, prom-prom ♪"
"♪ prom, prom, prom-prom ♪"
[ Gasps ] Prom!
Yikes.
Dudes.
Weak.
How come I'm the only one who's in the prom spirit?
'Cause you're the only one insane enough to think that we're gonna jump aboard your crazy train.
"Ellie, I caught some of that, and I don't think I liked it."
You know what sucks?
The fact that I'm the only one that is weird enough and goofy enough to take this as a chance for us all to have a little fun ourselves.
That's what sucks.
- [ Door opens and closes ]
- O...
M...
Gigi freakin' Fernández!
[ Both giggle ]
"If you attend our fundraising event next week, we promise not tell everyone that you're a..."
Despicable liar.
"Well, I guess that I,"
I don't really have a leg to stand on.
"No, and while we're on that subject, work on your limping."
"Oh, and get dark glasses."
You'll be blind by then.
"Oh, there you are."
Your mum went out looking for you.
I know.
"Oh, I lost her two streets over."
"Look, she made a mistake."
But she was just trying to get you to talk.
I know.
And how does that make you feel?
What?
Never mind.
I'm gonna tell you how it makes you feel.
"See, for the past week, I've been seeing therapists... and they've been trying to get me to talk."
But I don't like it.
Partly because it's none of their bloody business.
But mostly because I'm afraid if...
"I do start to open up and let it out,"
I might completely fall apart.
Is that how it makes you feel?
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
So I just don't wanna talk about it at all.
"But it doesn't make you any less angry, does it?"
No.
"Look, I understand."
My dad left my mum... and it really messed with my head and my trust.
"And when I was in my 20s,"
We won't fit the description so easily.
No problem.
Ain't that some shit.
"You going to be able to make it a whole day without me, baby?"
I don't know.
DALE:
Looks to me like just her brother and her mom is there.
DUD:
What kind of people are they?
Good people.
Christian people.
I can't believe she got mixed up in shit like this.
"Hurricane, I'm still unclear how you know this Lila Walker."
"Well, sir, I arrested her for shoplifting once."
She was just a kid in high school.
All she took was some lipstick and...
You know that shit they put on their eyes.
Wasn't worth 10 bucks.
I could tell right off she wasn't bad.
Just sort of high-spirited.
So I decided to try to help her out.
"You know, talk to her."
Then one day she just up and disappeared.
"Somebody said she'd decided to take off for Hollywood, become a movie star."
"Anyway, that was about, oh, five years ago."
That's the last I heard of her till now.
She's come a long way from ripping off lipstick.
I don't believe she killed anybody.
"I mean, that kid in the closet, she opens the door, sees him, then closes the damn door."
That proves she's not a killer.
"Pardon me, Hurricane, but that don't prove shit."
DUD:
I'm kind of nervous.
"Ryan, could you quit fretting over your nerd gear for like five seconds?"
"We have a real crisis on our hands, unless Summer's wrong, and I'm not completely insufferable."
"- Why didn't you just tell me, then?"
- It was kind of hard getting a word in.
"I mean, you're a good talker, but you're not so"
Summer's right then.
"I have to do, I have to change."
I have to be a better person.
Better how?
"Uh, less selfish."
"More selfless, less take, more give."
"- Less pitching, more catching."
"- Look, man, I'm used to it."
You don't have to change for me.
"- Oh, I'm not changing for you."
"- For who then, Summer?"
"Uh, no, no, uh, uh, I"
- I think for the greater good of man.
"There's no hidden agenda here, like say, getting Summer back?"
"Dude, I don't even want Summer back."
"Unless... that is what she wants, in which case, that's not about me."
"That's about... me supporting her, and her wanting of, of, of me..."
"But I think that's what she wants, okay?"
Just admit it... you want her back.
No.
"No, I don't."
"- It's the new me, Ryan."
"World, wrap your head around the new Seth Cohen."
- You're talking about yourself in the third person
How is Seth's hair right now?
"- Oh, you can thank me later."
"You know, his eyes."
"I swear, I'll never forget his eyes as long as I live."
He wasn't breathing.
I saw him die.
There was blood...
"Oh, God."
"Okay, sir, calm down."
Tell me where he was;
I need an address.
In an alley off of 57th.
You-you got to send someone out there.
"We will, but I need you to stay on the line with me, okay?"
Police say the call came in at 5:47 this morning.
- Tracks with Michael's account.
- Sounded genuinely upset.
Connection to the victim?
None that I can find.
I searched e-mail accounts and phone records for both Michael Thomas and Petty Officer Adams.
No communication between them.
Michael's boss said that Adams was never a customer at the shop.
Background.
"Petty Officer Caleb Adams joined the Navy right out of high school, had two overseas deployments and a spotless record."
C.O. called him a bright and hardworking man.
Assigned to the Hagen destroyer in 2010.
Adams was one of 215 sailors off the ship last night for liberty.
"Tracking down others who may have been with him, but we do have this."
He called someone named Meredith Bilson five times in five hours.
The last call came in at 4:34 a.m..
That's an hour before his death.
Location?
Apartment manager at her last known address says she hasn't lived there in three months.
Keep looking.
But if you hurt Lucien... you know what could happen if his gang finds out what you did and why.
Eye for an eye.
They gonna come after me.
"Or worse, take it out on Chivonne."
That's why I asked you here.
"Talk me out of it, to help me find another way."
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
We were just having an illuminating conversation with Anezka here.
Thanks.
You can go.
We'll be in touch.
What's going on?
HOLMES:
"Were you aware that when Tendu disappeared, he was in the company of a woman named Libena Havel?"
No.
"No, I wasn't."
BELL:
"Apparently, she's his girlfriend."
"When we heard her name, it struck us that we'd already met one Czech woman, Anezka."
Having two different Czechs wrapped up in the same case seemed like more than a coincidence.
HOLMES:
We wondered if she and Anezka knew each other.
"If they did, Anezka could help us find Libena, which, in turn, could help us find Tendu."
"Anezka gave us this, from a gaming convention a few months back."
"She identified this girl as Libena, another of your trade show models."
"She said Libena and Tendu met at a party last week, here at this house."
Yeah.
HOLMES:
She also told us that she and Libena were more than just models.
They're prostitutes.
BELL:
-You look lovely.
"-l look good, huh?"
You look wonderful.
Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you.
"Don't paint any more religious pictures, please."
God be with you.
We always called each other goodfellas.
You'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us. """
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew you've got to be 100 percent Italian so they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
"See, it's the highest honor they can give you."
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
"It also means you can fuck around with anybody, just as long as they aren't also a member."
It's like a license to steal.
It's a license to do anything.
"Hey, how many years ago was it you was made?"
"Ah, I'm an old-timer."
Thirty years ago.
"30 years, huh?"
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a fuckin' pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
Like you'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us."""
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.
"To become a member of a crew, you've got to be 100% Italian so they can trace your relatives back to the old country."
It's the highest honor they can give you.

It means nobody can fuck around with you.
It also means you could fuck around with anybody just as long as they aren't also a member.
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.
How many years ago since you were made?
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
We would now have one of our own as a member.
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.
Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
"No, we had a problem."
We tried to do everything we could.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Wow drama in a wedding that's shocking.
Yeah well Jill wants this chapel filled with eight thousand red roses and some like...
Eighty thousand dollar wedding dinner and seven thousand dollar wedding dress.
And her dad won't cover the entire tab.
Wow I'm very glad that I'm not Drew right now.
Or her dad.
"Yeah but that's just Jill, you know?"
Only love her for it she's extravagant.
You know I've known her since I was eleven.
We went to boarding school together.
You went to boarding school when you were eleven.
Did you miss your parents a lot?
Yeah... it's complicated.
When did you get home to see them?
"Well on the holidays, or you know the occasional odd long weekend."
I liked boarding school.
It was what I needed.
How do you mean?
Well my parents died when I was a kid.
I told you that right?
No I'm very sorry I didn't know that.
How did they die together?
No they actually died separately.
Um my was when I was 5.
My mom when I was 11.
"Oh no, no, no it's not sad."
It was a really long time ago.
I just don't talk about it much because...
Um what about your parents?
They're... still together right?
"Still together yeah, after 30 years."
And totally in love with each other.
They've got Pentangeli.
"I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike."
I swear to God I didn't know.
Johnny Ola bumped into me in Beverly Hills.
He said that he wanted to talk.
He said that you and Roth were in on a big deal together.
And that there was something in it for me if I could help him out.
"He said that you were being tough on the negotiations but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast,"
it would be good for the family.
And you believed that story?
You believed that?
"He said there was something in it for me, on my own!"
"-I've always taken care of you, Fredo."
-Taken care of me?
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?
"""Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that!"""
"""Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere. """
"""Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"""
"I'm your older brother, but was stepped over!"
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!
"I can handle things, I'm smart!"
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb.
I'm smart and I want respect!
Is there anything you can tell me about this investigation?
Anything more?
"The Senate lawyer, Questadt."
He belongs to Roth.
- Pete?
"- Yeah, this was cold."
- This is pretty rough.
- I can see the rosiness...
- I almost didn't give you my jacket.
"- Yeah, just to be a douche."
- Just because I was so cold.
"- I thought you would have to have some major, like, Lord of the Rings CGI on my nipples because it was..."
It was like...
Nipples isn't PG-13.
They were like...
I got to the point where I couldn't feel my extremities.
"I mean, it was so cold."
"I was in a damn T-shirt, you know?"
T-shirt.
"In Lord of the Rings, are they known for their nipple CGI?"
Yes.
What do you think?
Of course.
"Oh, awkward pause."
Anyway...
"That jacket, by the way, the jacket that I put on you which is a jacket that we actually wore in like..."
"It kind of provided a bit of warmth, but not as much as you'd think."
"- No, it was like..."
- Like a thin cotton.
- It was like wearing a plastic bag.
- Yeah.
"Actually, wearing a plastic bag would've been warmer."
Look at all this.
"Okay, so let's talk about..."
- Tension.
"- The time where they had to stop the van short and I flew back and I, like, landed on my bad wrist that I had a minor surgery and stuff on in the exact spot, like on a metal drum pole."
That was pretty good.
"- I will shoot you, Sherbert."
"- All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
"- Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff."
- No!
- Now let's me and you take a little walk.
- Ooh.
"- How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?"
Do you even have a plan?
- I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
"Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again."
- Pfft.
You're scrambling.
"- Look, I told you, we're NYPD."
"- Yeah, right."
- I can prove it.
"Look up ""Brooklyn detective attacked by birds."""
You'll see an article with a photo of me.
-Officerdown.
Allavailableunitsrespond.
"- I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake."
"My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD."
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.
- Keep walking.
- Let him go.
"- Put that gun down, or he dies."
- He's not gonna shoot me.
He needs me alive to get out of here.
"- Yeah, you willing to take that bet?"
"Mother, it's 8:00."
We have a rehearsal in Tokyo today.
We know about your rehearsal.
Go right ahead.
Mother.
"You met Takehara, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
Is he doing well?
"Yes, he is."
You seem to be meeting him often.
Is there something going on?
"I had to talk to him about selling the ""Hana."""
You have to talk with him about that?
He used to rent it out.
That's kind of a strange way to do things.
Why do you have to ask him for permission?
I'm not.
"Ah, so you're not finished with him."
Is that what it is?
I have to go.
"Mother, it's funny but don't you think that there was more peace in the house during the war."
"Yes, I think so."
"Back then, everyone got along, and it wasn't like it is now with everyone going their separate ways."
Perhaps it's my fault.
We didn't worry about unnecessary things back then.
That's true.
It was because our freedom was taken away from us.
"If it hadn't been for the war, you would be in England or France dancing at a ballet school."
"Yes, that's right."
And I might have gone with you.
The war delayed my studies.
"If it hadn't been for the war, even if I had kept studying with you, I might be teaching my own children now."
Not really.
I'm sort of all right as I am.
"Please, Will."
"What does that mean? ""Please"" what?"
Look at yourself.
You're 38 and you've never had a job or a relationship that lasted longer than two months.
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.
"I mean, I would say you were a disaster."
"I mean, what is the point of your life?"
Bloody hell.
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life but thank you for bringing it up.
The reason we wanted you to come here today was we wanted to ask you how would you like to be Imogene's godfather?
Seriously?
Seriously.
"Listen, I'm really, really touched."
But you must be joking.
I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene.
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice."
"We know, I just thought you had hidden depths."
No.
No.
You've always had that wrong.
I really am this shallow.
Here we are.
"You know you don't have to walk me to school anymore now, Mum."
I know the way now.
But what if I like walking you to school?
Right.
You just missed out on the night of your life.
(PANTING) The night of your life.
I've been in love with her for five years.
I've been in love with her for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.
"Hey, maybe you can't dunk anymore, but you've achieved more in your 30 years than that 15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of."
You put yourself through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And you married a smoking-hot chick who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you an entire foot closer to dunking.
"There you go, Vanilla Thunder."
Step back.
(MARSHALL SCREAMING)
"Oh, baby."
"How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office, and you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?"
MARSHALL:
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?
"Sure, baby."
- She loves me!
- But I chose her!
Guys!
Guys!
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.
"Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there, that window's gonna open up again in, like, 10 minutes."
"- Wait, where's Maggie?"
- She's gone.
- What?
- I sent her home.
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.
Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!
Mr. Lin?
Come in.
"Mr. Lin, your brother and his girlfriend were killed at the beach car park on Sept 3."
We suspect they fought back and were killed.
We found a metal ruler at the crime scene.
We matched the prints on the ruler to a Lo Keung
We shouldn't show you these but you were once a brilliant cop in China.
We hope... you understand.
"You can provide us more info and facts, then we can solve this case."
"I remember he has a diamond watch and a belt,"
a wallet with a photo of us.
Well done!
The whole HK knows.
I've never seen so many letters of praise but there're just as many complain letters.
They're all yours!
Tell me.
Why all this for a small robber?
You caused major road chaos in Central.
So who is going to back you up next time?
"Sir, a small robber is still a robber."
We shouldn't discount them.
"Also, there were hostages to protect."
Who do you think you are?
Superhero?
No one likes you in the whole station!
"I don't care, I just want to do my job."
I don't care.
This is the police.
We've rules to follow.
"If not for your father asking his friends to call the Chief, you'd have been fired."
Get lost and be your rich playboy!
Get out!
"We boys go, but girls go as well, but it's the first time that..."
"Marcel, you never laugh."
I never laugh?
"You don't know... I don't know you, but it seemed to me... I laugh so much that I've paid for it."
Why?
Some teachers don't like it.
"Even so, you seemed sad to me."
I'm like that too. I find it hard to get to know people.
One for six.
"- For how much have you, please?"
"- For seven, six and five."
"- Two for six, please."
- They're sold out for today.
Then for seven.
They're all sold out.
Couldn't you manage it somehow?
Those two for six.
"I promised the teacher, but I came late."
"Wait here, I'm just going to get out of playing the trombone."
"Don't show yourself much near the cinema, mum teaches here, I've got tickets, we'll pop off to that cinema."
You're going to play the trombone now?
You enjoy playing?
"I took it up, it was for free, I could play."
Have you performed anywhere?
"On May Day, we gave a concert in a village."
So I'm going to get it over and done with.
"All right, I'll wait for you."
Careful!
"The same melody is repeated half way through, but the first time it's piano, and the second time...?"
- Mezzo-forte.
- And which is louder?
Mezzo-forte.
- What did Mr. Somers say to that?
"Told me to help myself, that they'd all be looking for a job next morning."
I told him that Axel would blow his top.
"I think that'll be all, sir."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Just where at the Somers factory did this conversation take place?
"Well, it was in the parking lot that I ran into him, actually."
You share a common parking lot with Somers' factory?
"No, no, of course not."
Then how did you know you'd be able to reach him there?
I called him at his office.
They said he'd be leaving.
- You called from where?
- From my home.
"- Really, I don't see--"
- You went home and then you decided?
"No, no, I'd gone home for an early bite because I knew I had to come back to the office that evening."
It was on my way.
"Really, Your Honor, I don't see--"
"May it please the court, I ask permission at this time to recall a witness."
"Yes, Axel told me to put in calls long distance-- one for you and one for Mr. Hadley."
"The call to Mr. Hadley, what time was that?"
Right after you hung up.
About 8?
8:30?
Was the call completed?
No.
"The phone rang and rang, but no answer."
All right.
So I drove up to the Valley.
It was there at the motel that I spoke to Somers.
"I'm starving, too."
There's probably something in here.
Karen's ziti?
It's the last one she made.
And it was like 300 degrees in that Minnie Mouse head?
"So I took it off, you know?"
I was gonna have a cigarette.
- And some kid took a picture of me.
"- Come on, girls."
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.
"Look, Carmine."
You basically know what's going on with your dad and Johnny... and us over in Jersey.
"First let me say, I understand."
I appreciate the respect you're showing me by coming here... and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.
I will also go on record as saying...
I know my old man can be a tough nut to crack.
"I don't want to crack nuts, but I will."
I feel the anger.
"When I try, for the second time... on a separate issue entirely, to reach an accommodation... and he don't even make a counteroffer, where's his respect?"
I don't know what kind of advice he's getting from Johnny.
Johnny's always usually a voice of moderation.
"Me and him, we get along good."
"So, all due respect, let's not jump in and blame Johnny."
True.
John's a pragmatist.
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.
-Like what?
Speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
"Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon."
She says she's the devil himself.
If you've seen as many psychotics as I have you'd realize that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind.
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
-No.
-Did you know my mother died recently?
"-Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
-No.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
Hello?
"- Here, take it and just don't...."
"Any problems, he goes to Paulie."
"Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie."
"Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy he can call Paulie."
But now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week no matter what.
"""Business is bad?"
"Fuck you, pay me."
"Oh, you had a fire?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"""The place got hit by lightning, huh?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"Also, Paulie could do anything."
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
"And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount."
Take a $200 case of booze and you sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
"And then finally, when there's nothing left when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze you bust the joint out."
You light a match.
Do you need any help reaching anything?
"You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree, ya fuckin' prick."
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
Who?
"The Jew broad, Diane."
I was tellin' you about inside.
"I been trying to bang this broad for a fuckin' month, now."
"The only thing, she won't go out with me alone, ya know?"
-No.
"-No, what?"
"No, what Henry?"
So I'll fry you and your family.
Connector of Frank.
Connector of.
Connector of!
Connector of.
"81-54, how long does it take you to get there?"
I can be there in four minutes.
Do you want to drive me home?
I think my car is stolen.
Father!
Is it really you?
Shall we go and bathe now?
After all these years ... and alle the pigs I've had around me   Should I lie here alone with a cop.
How it ends for most thugs.
Their only fixed point is the cop who followed them.
What do you want?
I do not know.
APPLICATION AGAINST POLICE Västra Götaland
"for five years, I have worked the police in Västr a Götaland, -"
- See Annex 1 on signed and tasks performed by the code name Lisa.
Now I am uncovered and live on the run with a pr ice on my head.
"Hvisjeg was revealed, I thought, police management would help me."
Have you wondered why we live under a death threat?
Answer me!
Is it our fault?
He ar works for you!
It is your responsibility!
I thought I would get help but that did not happen.
"I have a closer look at the nemmelsen, that police management would see me dead."
Despite the police's own lawyer has exposed me to a lawyer.
- You must come with us to the station.
"- What is it, Dad?"
Of course.
Look at that face.
And he's even more beautiful in person.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Wait a minute.
You know Jesse?
From when he came into the office.
Swoon.
He let me take my picture with him.
"Yeah, there he is."
"Thanks, Janet."
"You met Jesse, and you didn't tell me?"
What was he doing here?
"Sometimes when famous people have trouble with fans, they come to us for help."
And that is all I can say because of...?
Confidentiality.
That's my little lawyer.
Okay.
IAndiamos comer tacos!
"Hey, thanks for hearing us out, Mr. Price."
"You be good, Serena, or you know who's gonna hear about it?"
Captain Nico!
"Hang on one second, sweetie."
Mr. Jackson.
"If there were anything I could do to ease your family's pain, I would do it."
So I hope I can count on you not to pursue the matter through my wife.
"Sure thing, Mr. Price."
"'Cause you and me, we both know how important it is to be able to count on somebody."
There's nothing there.
I can hit three buttons right now and tell you what street vendor in Shanghai serves the juiciest sheng jian bao.
NASA can tell me what every rock on every moon of Jupiter has for lunch.
"Somewhere out there, there is software that can pull an image out of that blur and save a little girl's life."
What we want to talk about is...
"They keep you pretty busy out there, don't they, Chief?"
Sure.
You got six people dead out there all at the same time.
We don't get that here.
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
"Colored boys, generally."
Just like out there.
One of them sticks another one over a card game or some shit.
"Chief Dixon, I think we should discuss..."
Craps sometimes.
You were wanting to know about this boy's uncle.
I think we hit the jackpot.
The uncle's place is the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.
"It's out in the woods, northeast of town, over this old rickety bridge."
You couldn't find a soul out there if you didn't already know where to look.
"You boys being from the city, you'd be lost in 10 minutes."
"But I'll be with you, so you don't have to worry about that."
"Damn, Bonnie."
Excuse me?
"Oh, nothing."
CHERYL ANN:
They were out of onion rings so I got you tasty taters.
"It's L.A., Cheryl Ann."
Chief Jenkins and them.
"Yes, sir?"
Will this be a promising avenue of investigation?
"Oh, it's a promising avenue, all right."
Me and my deputies can start setting up a surveillance now.
"Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that until we get a game plan?"
"Well, if you say so."
JENKINS:
"When the exchange opens, i'll be down there buying, buying, buying!"
All right.
I warned you.
"Thank you, commodore."
Ha ha!
"Luke, get my carriage."
It's time for me to charge the enemy.
No.
"I'm not gonna let you budge from this office, jim."
It's worth your life.
You think i'm going to back down now because of those hot-air threats?
You think i'm scared?
You could fight just as hard back of that ticker as you can down in the gold room.
That's a great idea.
I'll stay here behind the barricades.
"Before the exchange opens, you go down there and tell my brokers to keep on buying."
"When gold reaches 200, i'll march down there in glory."
"After this is all over, you can do all the parading you want to, but you don't have to go down there today!"
"Oh, yes, i do."
"When gold reaches 200, i got to be there to collect a bet."
"Are you going for me now, or must i spoil a good idea by going myself?"
"I'm going, boss."
Buy and keep on buying.
Buy!
"Buy, she is."
"You boys watch that door and don't let nobody get in there, you hear me?"
I want to see jim fisk!
Aah!
"I'll bid 25,000!"
I'll buy it.
Any more bids?
Who's got gold?
There's two sides to that.
I made a mistake.
"Look, you know more about this sort of thing than I do."
I don't want you thinking that we're incompetent down here in Star City.
"Let me tell you, Dale, you got the energy and dedication of 10 cops."
No shit?
No shit.
"Say, Dud."
"Let me ask you about something else I was thinking about, and if I'm full of shit, you just tell me, all right?"
All right.
"Well, sir,"
I've been thinking about moving to L.A. and joining up.
Joining up with what?
Police department.
Been on the force down here ever since I was grown.
"Hell, after 10 years of busting peeping Toms and stop sign runners,"
I'd kind of like to take a crack at the big time.
"Now I realize that getting on the force out there is no walk in the park, but, well, I figure after we wrap up this big case here, and with your recommendation..."
"Well, who knows, you know?"
I think you and me and Mackintosh can make a hell of a team.
"That's, um..."
That's an interesting idea.
Well?
"How you doing, Hurricane?"
"Hi, Larry."
"Hey Dud, this is Larry Gibson."
He's our local Smokey.
"Larry, this is Dud Cole."
He's from L.A.
How are you?
"Hi, good."
Last night some folks killed a Texas state trooper in Odessa.
I spend 23 hours a day wondering whether we' re wrong for each other.
Wondering whether we've got the energy that we need to get through everything that we seem to get into.
Whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship.
"But in the 24th hour, I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours."
"And I come back to, there's something about her that I can't stay away from."
Something about her that makes me wanna love her.
"Julia, my sister, read this story about a little Japanese girl who had cancer."
"And she tried to make a thousand paper cranes because she thought if she did, it would make her wish come true."
- What was her wish?
- To get better.
So how many paper cuts do you have?
A lot.
But my wish is kind of different.
What is it?
It's hard to explain.
"I kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh?"
Not bad at all.
Cop wounded in a multi-car collision.
"BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats."
"Jing-Mei, take him in."
I'll wait on the next.
- Find the guys?
- The guys opened fire.
- We have a bunch of cops hurt.
"- Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer."
MVA with passenger-space intrusion.
- Can't breathe.
"- Hey, nice to see you again."
- You know him?
"- He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled."
- Isn't that right?
- Correct.
"I'm trapped at N.Y.U., and- and it's too late to transfer."
So what's wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial
"And a ""Gossip Girl"" blast or two?"
"Nothing, I guess, but you can always make it right"
With whoever you take down online.
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna have time
To do that with Lily or not?
"Morning, sunshine."
"I've got the Dom '95, your favorite."
"No, thank you."
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.
"Oh, I apologize."
Nadine left behind some of her intimates.
She must have wanted an excuse to come back.
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.
"If you're here to mock me, I'm not in the mood..."
Unless you have some punishment in mind.
"We've broken up, Chuck,"
"And frankly, I don't care what you do."
But I can't sit by and just watch you avoid Lily.
I'm actually quite busy with work.
"Well, you had time for Nadine."
"Trust me, she was work."
"And I promise you, Lily is not sitting around,"
Wondering when she's going to hear from Chuck bass.
Justify not seeing Lily all you want.
You and I both know what this is.
"You've lost Bart,"
"Elizabeth betrayed you,"
And the thought of losing Lily terrifies you.
Please.
Spare me your N.Y.U. Freshman psych analysis.
I should have benched Grimes on the bin-Khalid raid.
"Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?"
He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy - I just...
"I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just..."
I tried to get his head straight.
We all missed it.
"Now my men are dead, because of Grimes."
"And now he has the list, and, uh... if any more people get killed..."
You can't put this on yourself.
Are you going to help me or not?
"Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?"
In the back of a patrol car.
You're gonna let them arrest you?
"Look, I'm a black man standing on the corner at 3rd and Decatur."
"Trust me, it won't be that hard."
"Just be ready to take care of the security cameras, okay?"
I'll call you when I'm inside.
Carter?
Drop the bag.
Where the hell you going?
- Just walking.
- Yeah?
How about you walk over there and put your hands on the wall?
"Whoa, whoa, Paul, Paul, come on, easy."
Pat him down.
"Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm."
I said pat him down.
"Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?"
"His gun, get it and kick it over here."
- Hurry up.
- All right.
All right.
It won't change the way I feel.
"I've tried steroids, fluid restriction."
Nothing's working.
Neuro says he's not a surgical candidate.
I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now.
Okay.
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.
"Yeah, physically, but she will not forgive herself, and nothing I said was gonna get her... you guys think that when we die,"
"There's like a bookkeeper, and he tallies up everything we did... all the lives we saved, all the people we helped, and if we've done enough good in the world, that it makes up for the times that we just completely fail?"
No.
I don't think anyone's keeping score.
"I think we do what we can, we hope for the best, and that's all anybody can do, right?"
"I think, uh, I think that we..."
"we do what we can do when we know how to do it, and it hurts."
It just... it hurts.
Violet's in the kitchen.
Hello.
Hi.
Come here.
Hi.
Yes.
Yeah.
Hmm.
"So I have this 11-year-old patient, stabbed her father."
"Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma, which made her... aggressive."
"Um, Addison's gonna remove it, but this girl just can't forgive herself."
Maybe she needs more time.
Time?
So should I offer her time?
"Well, what do you want, Cooper, a magic pill?"
Bad things happen.
- We need more police.
- When you going to send us some help?
"Glad you're here, Mr. Mayor."
The father's seated in the corner.
"I'm all yours, Leslie."
Questions and answers.
Who's up?
- The Post.
- Marx or Sadler?
Sadler.
Then I know what's coming.
"""Has probation become a sentence in this town?"""
Judge Stern has a powerful record.
He served six years and meted out the stiffest punishments in the city.
"If the report recommends probation, then probation it has to be."
"After that, they'll start in on the mandatory crap."
Good morning.
I want to welcome the Revs.
Williams and Birch...
- You got the probation report?
- In the office.
I'll be there in a minute.
"- And my dear friend, Reverend Milton Parks of the First Church of Harlem Reverend Chapman and Reverend Murray."
Thank you for coming here today.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
"Well, what can I say?"
How do I start this?
"There is one thing, as Mayor that I will never get over and that is the death of a police officer."
There is one thing in life that I will never get over and that is the death of an innocent child.
But this is an incident that won't go away...
Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"The whole city  all parts of the city  Bushwick, Jamaica, Washington Heights  Brownsville, Harlem..."
What's that look?
- What look?
"- The look, right there."
The one you get when you worry.
Nothing.
Nah.
"When you're done with host committee, why don't you come on inside."
"I'll be in the library with your uncle, okay?"
Senator.
I got to meet with the FCC.
They didn't know what hit 'em.
Thanks so much for coming.
Thanks for your help.
"Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."
A pleasure.
I'm making breaching charge.
The last one I used blew the hinges off
A metal door in Kandahar.
"I need you to get me through security, into your police station, and then into the evidence lockers."
Narco seized a ton of heroin and cash last week.
That's what he's after.
"Listen, I don't expect you to believe me, but if I don't get that money, a lot of people are gonna die."
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Okay, I didn't wake up this morning thinking this was gonna happen to me, either."
"I don't want to hurt anybody, but here's the deal."
"You're gonna do what I say, when I say it."
"You're gonna rob the station, that's crazy."
Yeah.
I keep hearing that.
"Isaac, we can't let him do this."
I want to talk to him.
To try to change his mind?
- Great song.
- It's a great song.
"I'm seeing some of the faces in the background and remembering all these people that we spent, like, two weeks with."
There was one female extra that had a thing for Kat.
- One female extra?
- Just one.
"One that came up and said something, but half a dozen had their eye on you."
"A little, like, ""Oh, yeah."""
"There was one female extra, blond girl in a hat, female extra who worked her way into every shot in the first third of the movie."
Really?
"You know what, I have to say it was a point of frustration."
"Because I felt like every shot we cut to, she'd snuck in there."
We should call Rafi and see if he has anything he wants to say.
All you have to do is put an ADR...
"Put an ADR line like, ""Oh, the O'Malley triplets are here tonight."""
- Jeez.
- They're all over the place.
This moment was reshot.
"- Yeah, this was reshot."
- That thing that just happened.
"Oh, yeah."
"Now, Pete, did we use the reshot kiss or the original kiss here?"
- We reshot the kiss.
- The reshot kiss.
"- Okay, because there were a few..."
- Why did you reshoot the kiss?
Because Rafi wasn't handsome enough in the background.
"If you look now, look at the face he makes."
- Not handsome.
- It is stunning.
- Everyone's...
"- I mean, look at that."
- It was so cold.
She has a funny story about the dance.
I can't remember what it is.
"But, like, it was a dance that they used to do in 8th grade or high school or something."
No.
"You know, what she did was she went back to Tawny Kitaen's choreography in the Whitesnake video."
"- Oh, my God."
- And she copied some of the moves.
"Yeah, because in that video, basically it's Tawny Kitaen dancing on the hood of a Trans Am or something."
- I don't know what it was.
- She looks great.
I mean...
- She modified it for the Yugo.
- She did.
Look at that wind.
That wind doesn't even...
That jacket just goes the other direction.
And they had these huge heater-tunnels things that blew hot air on you.
"It's great because it's so sexy, but so hilarious at the same time."
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so Tris.
"- Cheesy dance, but she looks fantastic."
- It's so painfully cold right now.
Look how cute she is.
What were you thinking when you were watching this take after take?
"I think I was thinking I'd rather be somewhere warm and ""Does she really need me to be here for this?"""
"- Oh, my God."
- Look how cute she...
Look how just...
- She's so adorable.
"- Oh, Mike."
"It looks like there's a wind machine, it's so perfect."
Off your duff Hartley
"One, two."
"One, two."
"""I greatly appreciated the jar of nuts you sent,"" comma..."
"""but would you please show up for your next appointment?"""
"Just sign it, ""Sincerely yours,"" and, you can type it after lunch."
What's the matter?
"I went to Jerry's health club, and I tried to keep up with a 65-year-old woman."
Did you lose any weight?
I don't know.
I'm too sore to get up on the scale.
Ha-ha.
"Listen, Bob."
Do you want another pitcher of water before I go to lunch... or should I just run a hose in here?
"You know, Carol, being on a diet is bad enough without people making fun of it."
"I mean, you probably don't know that."
You've probably never been on a diet.
"In five minutes, I will have been on a diet for seven years."
"You looking forward to your birthday party, Bob?"
"It's not a party, Carol."
"It's, just a small dinner."
"In my case, a very small dinner."
"Oh, listen, Bob."
I wanna ask you something.
Do you think I can have an extra 15 minutes off for lunch?
I have to buy a birthday present for someone.
"Oh, sure."
Take as much time as you want and buy that somebody something real nice.
I certainly will.
"- Well, see you later."
- Right.
- You pressed the button?
I already know?
"Look, Mr. Sandover, I really didn't pay any attention to it after I saw your initials on it and your forwarding slip when you sent it on to the bank."
Let me try to remember.
There may have been some other smaller--
Mr. Sandover?
Get the bags.
"Beth, it's me."
Don't get all excited now.
"I just missed my train, that's all."
But I have something to attend to this evening.
I'm taking the car.
Missed the train?
"But that was hours ago, Sandy."
"For heaven's sake, what happened?"
"I'll explain later, dear."
I'll fly down to Phoenix in the morning instead.
- But Sandy--
"- Look, there's nothing to be alarmed about."
I thought you were going out to dinner with Dorothea this evening.
"Well, yes, but later, so I really wanted to use the car myself, but..."
Oh.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"- Sandy, this is Perry Mason."
- Oh.
"I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Sandover."
Your wife and I are very old friends.
"Yes, of course."
She's always talking about people she used to know when Mr. Devro was alive.
"Sandy, Perry was nice enough to come by on his way home from work to give me some professional advice."
"Oh, all right, Beth, if you're thinking of a divorce, that's no reason to call in such an expensive lawyer."
- Sandy!
- I never handle divorces.
"By killing Cuddappah Raja for these people, you've kept up your father's promise."
How are you going to save your father who is in Konda Reddy's custody?
I know where my father is.
I will come back with my father.
You leave this place with these people.
Welcome!
Are you Singamuthu's son?
You can't find your father.
Konda Reddy has entered your people's camp.
You don't know about him.
He can knock 3 heads in one swing.
I don't know how many would have died by now.
Your men are going to die there.
And you're going to die here.
Catch him.
Get everyone into the bus.
Leave no child.
Get every child into the bus.
"When we locked up Singamuthu, your boss, everyone worked in fear."
"Now that his son is back, have you lost your fear?"
Get every child into the bus.
"Sir, all are innocent children."
Give us any punishment.
Don't harm them.
"Look, your children will be taken to Bihar or Orissa."
"If anyone tries to escape, we will cut your children's limbs and make them beg on Bombay streets."
Leave my brother.
Tell them to leave my brother.
How will they leave your brother?
You should've thought before doing something.
I told you but you never listened to me.
Now Singamuthu's son beat their men.
She's got the flu.
- Mm.
"- Yeah, she's got the flu and she didn't want to come, but I begged her."
Uh-huh.
"And she took this cold medicine, and it's knocking her out, but it--it's sweet, actually."
Now can we--or do I gotta keep pretending to enjoy this giant nut-covered ball of cream cheese
Olivia calls an appetizer?
You want me to represent you?
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna make an excuse up as to why you can't be at dinner tonight.
"You're gonna dump the broad, clean up your act, and never, ever come back to my house fucked up again."
You kicking your habit on your own?
That's a slim chance of happening.
"You two doing it together, zero."
That's my offer.
Okay.
[sets drink down]
"Yeah, I just thought of a perfect excuse."
Okay.
"Um, Olivia, we can't make dinner tonight because your husband's a cunt."
"Oh, Nick."
How's that?
You don't know her.
- You don't fucking know me.
- Mm-hmm.
I could throw a rock out your front door and hit nine of you.
You're not special.
You are a by-product of those of us who are!
[comic talking indistinctly onstage]
[Bill and Sully laughing and chatting]
"Yeah, I know you will, you always do."
Oh!
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy had killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.
"Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason."
"You had to have a sit-down, and you better get an okay or you'd be the one who got whacked."
"Saturday night was for wives, but Friday night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends."
"And last week we saw Sammy Davis, Jr."
You got to see this show.
What a performer!
He does these impersonations.
"I swear, you'd think it was the real people!"
"Oh, it's unbelievable."
You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me.
But you could see how some girls could.
Like that Swedish girl.
In other words you condone that stuff?
Take it easy.
I just wanna make sure I don't wind up kissing fuckin' Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
"But, you know, he's got personality."
"""Personality?"""
He's very talented.
I understand perfectly what you're saying.
But you have to watch out sometimes how you say things.
"You know, people get the wrong impression."
I just said he was talented.
Why don't you just leave it alone now?
He never mentioned trouble at work.
- You think there could be a connection?
- Could be.
"You hear ""A.T.F. investigation,"" it raises flags."
"Well, I wish I could be more helpful."
Sorry.
You should just focus on getting your son back.It's the best way to deal with it.
"Evelyn, I think you're stronger than you realize."
Then maybe I should have just stuck with it.
"You know, what would have happened if- if I had have pretended that everything was all right?"
"But I didn't want my family to be a lie- not forJasper, not for me."
You're doing the best thing.
Believe me.
I know a little something about this.
"I've stayed, and I've left, and sometimes leaving is what you have to do."
"Must be lonely, what you do."
- I couldn't live that way.
- In my line of work...
I can't allow myself to get too close.
What if you met someone?
There's a spark.
Would you ignore it?
Could you?
"I would, uh... concentrate on getting the job done."
I gotta head over to Doug's.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Okay.
"What's taking so long, Sam?"
You losing your touch?
I didn't know Doug would have a nine-pin dimple lock.
"You know, the new kind- the kind I haven't practiced on."
"Okay, my fingers are bleeding now."
This Thanksgiving is gonna be the worst!
You don't know that.
"The years my dad comes are great, and my mom years are disasters."
You should really try to appreciate the time you have with your mom.
Spoken like a man who drove his mother all the way to Oregon and enjoyed it.
"Well, our book club had just ended, and the last three books were set in the Pacific Northwest."
It just made sense.
I just want a peaceful Thanksgiving.
I have nothing to be thankful for!
Your three beautiful children are right here.
"Called to school by Dr. Ellie... great Special Ed teacher, terrible necklace-chooser."
Anna-Kat's behavior has been a little heightened lately.
She organized the stuffed animals by fur color.
Looks a little race-war-y.
Is anything going on at home?
Any changes?
"Well, her favorite toy pony, Frenchie..."
"Oh, I know about Frenchie's leg."
Mm.
Anything else out of the ordinary?
"Uh, the holidays can be stressful for parents, and sensitive kids can pick up on that."
My mother.
She's coming for Thanksgiving.
Ahh.
I-Is that complicated for you?
No.
It's pretty simple.
She's the worst.
My mom's the biggest narcissist on the planet.
She was a Pan Am stewardess back in the day when it meant something.
But was she there for me growing up?
No.
"He came down here Monday morning, asking for something to match his skin tone."
He didn't tell me what it was for.
"Well, we just left him."
His hands are pale.
"His face is, uh... tan."
- Which tone were you trying to match?
- More tan.
And he wanted it waterproof.
Waterproof to cover a wound?
Maybe it's not for nothing he's wearing a turtleneck.
We need to find someone who's seen him without his shirt on.
Unless you wanna take a shvitz with him.
They don't pay me enough.
So you do Gillian Booth's makeup?
- She always looks so radiant.
"- Oh, thanks."
Sad to think of her alone at a time like this.
The maestro must be a big help.
I know he was in her dressing room Sunday night.
Philip was the first friend I called.
He came right away.
"So Philip's a special friend, isn't he?"
Did he spend the night with you?
"Well, it's only natural that you wouldn't want to be alone with your grief, right?"
"Well, if that's what you mean... yes."
He held me while I cried.
We fell asleep.
Did you happen to notice if he had any wounds or scratches?
On him?
"What, you think we were naked?"
"I might have been very vulnerable, but Philip is no cretin."
All he did was encourage me to talk about Laura.
"I saved a child, but failed in my delivery."
God's ways are hard for us to penetrate.
"Benvolio, you can come no further."
Now take this letter early in the morn and see you deliver it to my lord and father.
"Farewell, Benvolio."
Let us say good night.
No.
But... but why descend into this bed of death?
"Partly, I must behold my lady's face."
"Chiefly, I'd return this precious ring to her fair hand which gave it me."
And now be gone.
"I go, and do not seek to question you."
By which you show your love.
"Goodbye, dear friend."
"Banished Romeo Montague, who murdered Juliet's cousin, noble Tybalt... causing her the grief that took her to the grave."
And now he comes to desecrate the dead.
Leave them to heaven and attend to me.
"We needs must fight, for you are bound to die."
The very reason why you find me here.
"I am Count Paris, and I here defend the grave of she who should have been my bride."
"Oh, good, gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury.
"Oh, fly hence."
"Be gone, survive."
What?
Should I buy this proof of your concern?
Or is a Montague afraid to fight?
"May God bless you, Paris."
Friar!
Friar Laurence!
- Friar Laurence!
- Who's there?
"- Yeah, a plain wrap..."
"And, well, it was about marriage and sex."
I had it sent to me at the post office.
It took me two weeks to get up the courage to go pick it up.
Look... .
"I know it sounds funny, but it was the only way I could find out anything."
"Norman, you know what?"
I sent for a book just like that in the same plain wrapper general delivery.
"- No, really?"
The same one?
"And I read every word of it, and I think most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense."
Maybe yours was better.
"Hey, want to trade books?"
No.
I'd be too embarrassed.
"That's your whole trouble, Norman."
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.
I know.
And I'm sorry we started talking about all this.
"Hey, Norman, look... ."
It's about time you learned that girls want to do the same things as boys.
And they have the right to know how.
"I mean, I think we should help each other."
- Are you suggesting that...?
"- Norman, don't get me wrong."
"All I want is some normal, intelligent discussion and maybe some normal affection between a boy and a girl, nothing more."
Everybody in this town hides behind plain wrappers.
You're so afraid.
You've even been afraid to ask me to the graduation dance.
"Allison, I want... ."
"Well, see, I'm just not asking anybody."
- I just want that to be known.
- You did.
You did.
"Okay, this is sexy."
This was the original beginning of the movie.
Right.
This is how the movie was gonna start before we shot...
"Yeah, this was the opening scene."
- Look at Rafi go.
- People went bananas for Rafi.
That's really Rafi's voice too.
That's him singing.
"Although, we're not playing those instruments."
He is the only one who's really doing it.
I'm playing an instrument.
- The love instrument.
- Your body is your instrument as an actress.
"When we rehearsed this scene, before we started shooting it in Don Hill's and we were listening to that song, it was one of the most exciting moments of all..."
"People love this song and they would, like, sing it between shooting it."
This was the first few days of shooting in here.
- Why isn't this on the soundtrack?
- This was the first week of shooting.
- We were all strangers.
- It's not on the soundtrack?
It's on iTunes.
I'm gonna buy it.
"So, what are you talking about, Pete, with the stars in the sky or something?"
"Well, in the title design, they drew little squiggles and stuff in the sky."
"I was waiting for it to happen, it already happened."
"If you squint really hard and do like this, you can see."
- Okay.
- It's similar.
I'd be packing in no time.
No time at all.
That's very clearly stated.
"So, what do the rest of you think about what he just said?"
Should people take the law into their own hands like that?
"I mean, is that the answer?"
Does that solve anything?
Anyone?
Angela?
Angela?
And right before the gun went off...
I was thinking about how much I wanted that soda.
is that weird?
"Like, why did I leave it there in the first place?"
And what if I had gotten up to go get it right at that moment?
"Oh, my God. I think I better change my locker."
Like what happens when you don't sleep.
Like I haven't slept since it happened and keeps coming back to me...
just keeps coming back.
What was that?
I just keep going over and over in my mind.
Like all my friends and they go by the locker all the time...
"and it's just, not even me."
"If someone just had been going by there, and gotten shot."
"It's hard, isn't it?"
"You don't think I could get a few days off, do you?"
You are here again because I wanted to hear your story...
and Detective Martinson wanted to hear it too.
I really don't have anything else to tell.
M r.
"Krakow, can I tell you something?"
This is a good school.
She won't say a thing.
It's like she's thinking really hard about something.
We think...
We think that Maria doesn't remember a thing.
- What do you mean?
- She won't talk about it.
"We tell her about things like you and your house, but all she says is I don't remember."
Foguinho thinks she doesn't want to remember.
"If you ask me, she simply can't."
What did she say when you told her it was time to live with me?
She said she wants to stay in the circus forever.
I see.
"We explained that this is not possible, 'cause she is too little to work by herself like that."
She didn't like it one bit.
"I'm no educated woman like you, Mrs. Maria Cecflia, but I'm very candid and say what's on my mind."
It's a crying shame that Maria can't stay with us.
"You're her grandma, and you have the right but I think she'd be happier with us."
The magic rope trick requires great concentration.
- Are you concentrating?
- Yes!
My assistant Maria will give me a hand for the magic rope trick.
"Maria, pull very hard."
- Are you very concentrated?
- Yes!
"Let go, Maria."
"Foguinho, we're late."
There's a show tonight.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
"- Bye, kids."
Is it time already?
"Show us another trick, Foguinho!"
He wants to destroy the whole world.
Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?
He really does have a doomsday device?
"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during harmonic convergence, which is only a few days away."
"If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over."
"Sir, we desperately need your help."
"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
There are lives on the line!
And my daughter is one of them.
"Raiko, you must reconsider."
"I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here."
"If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim, I need to protect my citizens."
I'm sorry.
Sir...
Nuktuk needs your help.
I know you love helping people.
"Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
I never should have saved that guy.
"If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
"Yeah, me too."
Thank you.
It's so good to see you guys again.
"Wait, where's Mako?"
So how was the big premiere?
I saved the president!
In real life!
"Wait, what?"
You were right about Varrick.
He tried to kidnap Raiko!
I knew it.
"But it didn't work, because of you."
And because of me.
- No.
I don't think so.
Did he know Diane?
"- He says no, but I think yes."
Are we gonna see him?
No.
How 'bout a piano player called Tickler?
"Well, I remember somebody at the club who played piano, but I don't recall his name."
"You know, Mr. Caine, it sounds like you didn't know anybody there, and nobody there knew you except Diane."
It was a long time ago.
I told you the club wasn't one of my hangouts.
I met Diane at the beach.
"Sure, I knew people, but I don't remember their names, even their faces."
"Look, there's only one person I am interested in meeting, and that's Diane."
"Now, if you haven't found her, where are you taking me?"
To jar your memory.
?
[ Radio:
Distant ]
[ Engine Shuts Off]
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Last place you saw Diane was here.
"No, no."
The last time I saw Diane was on the dock.
I told you that.
"You know, Magnum, you keep testing me, and I don't like it."
And you're not telling me everything you know.
"Come on, Mr. Caine."
It's tough enough finding a woman who disappeared 40 years ago without my own client sandbagging me.
"Magnum, there is nothing more I can tell you that'll help you find Diane."
Nothing.
You just have to believe me.
"Becky, give me a minute, will you?"
"Trevor, you know better than to come here."
"Yeah, I know."
I'm sorry.
We talked about this.
"Yeah, I know, Clark, but, please, I really have to talk to you."
- Not here.
Not now.
- But it's important.
"I'll come by as soon as I can, but get the hell out of here, and don't ever come back."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, ok."
That's much better.
That's much better.
Now you have to turn these both around.
This signature.
And then bring it...
Get everyone in there.
There are approximately two hours between Ramon's abduction here and his escape here.
He crossed the train tracks here.
"Now, given the time and distance parameters, there's no way the unsub could have ventured outside this radius."
"Ok, he said the train was close, and he heard laughter and loud music."
I looked at points of interest next to the train tracks and there really isn't much.
"There's a warehouse, a taco stand that would have been closed, and a bar called the Drunken Dog."
Why stop there?
He need a drink?
He doesn't seem like the drinking type.
He's not impulsive or sloppy enough.
"I live to serve you, sir."
"Garcia, what can you tell us about a bar called the Drunken Dog?"
"Ooh, I like it already."
Let's see.
"Uh, it's been around 30 years."
Of all the people!
Please don't say it like it was a terrible thought.
That superinjunction cost a lot of money.
DOORBELL
LAUGHTER
It's Rhys Darby!
Welcome.
Wow!
"Rhys Darby, ladies and gentlemen."
Have a seat.
Hi!
How are you?
Rhys Darby from Flight of the Conchords.
"Now then, everybody tonight has come dressed up because it's party time."
Are you a big partygoer?
"Oh, I'm king of the parties."
Really?
Not really.
LAUGHTER
Did you used to go...?
"Do you remember at the school disco at the end of the night, all having a great time, and then they'd play Happy Christmas (War Is Over)?"
# So this is Christmas... # And that was when all your mates would pair off with girls and I would be stood at the edge of the dance floor with my nose pressed against the window pane.
A metaphorical window pane.
Or were you one of the boys who managed to nab a girl for that important last dance/snog?
"Well, I'll admit"
I'm a keen dancer.
"And...and what I lacked in the initial, social, conversational period"
I would more than make up for once the song's come on.
I really clear my own space.
You can ask anyone and I am probably the hottest dancer that I know.
"Well, Rhys, I mean, we have a band."
We have a rug.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
"By the way, I think I saw April making out with Shep Cale."
"All right, all right."
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
"Figure you should have something ready, so you don't embarrass yourself."
"You mean so I don't embarrass you, because you don't have to worry."
"Oh, is that how you spell ""venereal disease""?"
"Jake, this day is important to me, okay?"
Just because your life's a big joke doesn't mean you have to treat mine that way.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is my life a joke?
Just read the speech.
"No, seriously, Eric, why is my life a joke?"
I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder what you've been doing?
You spend all that time in flight school getting your license.
"Instead of using it, you come back here, and you hang out like it's the summer after high school."
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
"Well, hey, if I'm such a joke, then why'd you want me as your best man?"
"You didn't want me, did you?"
"No, not really."
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Ow!
Damn it!
"Fortunately, the producers are two of my oldest and dearest friends."
"And, uh, ahem, I may be able to persuade the boys to part with a small piece of the show."
"Mind you, I said I might be able to."
"Chop's coming right along, my dear?"
"- Yes, in a moment, father."
"- Uh, may I?"
"- Thanks, I think I can manage."
- Ah..
"Charming girl, your daughter."
Nice of you to go to all this trouble for me.
"Oh, anything to make you happy."
(Tyler) 'It's a special ambition of mine to feature you' 'in my first production.
Or did I tell you.'
"(Patricia) 'Yes, I think you did.'"
"Sorry, I'm already rehearsing in a play."
- What kind of a play?
"- A musical called Hooray For Love, if you must know."
"Ooh, Hooray For Love."
Good show?
"(Patricia) 'Surely not as good as the one you'll produce, but it'll do.'"
"Huh, hot."
"Careful, not too much salt."
- You don't like salt?
- Hate salt.
You forgot this little corner over here.
Thank you.
"Tell me, uh, is the young one mine?"
How did you guess?
"Mr. Ganz, do you recall telling me the other afternoon when my daughter was rehearsing that you could use some additional money?"
"Whether you like it or not, you'll be in my fall production."
- Bet you my high head I won't.
- It's a bet.
You are not going to destroy my family.
"I wouldn't let that cow, Jeanette, and I won't let you."
That's why I had to kill her.
"All right it's over, Mr. Barr."
I said it's over.
"She didn't care about James, about the family."
A money-grubbing tart.
"He'd given her shares in the company, in her name."
His shares.
Didn't tell me.
"Our American partners were ready to buy them strip our assets, junk us."
It was business trouble.
She was using that.
She wanted a million pounds to sell back the shares.
And so what if she broke us?
And the affair?
"There was no affair, just that day."
"I met her in the hotel, to try and persuade her to sell the shares for a more reasonable sum."
I thought she'd agreed to everything.
She was playing me.
I'd always had... she could look at you and make you feel... it was blackmail.
That's why she did it.
You see in the end
I didn't have a choice.
So it was a question of business.
What about your brother's first wife?
That wasn't business was it?
That was jealousy.
Because that was the one thing of your brother's that you couldn't make your own.
So you took it from him.
Hey George!
"Come on, wake up!"
"It's not like that, Nate."
"Look, I know you and I haven't talked very much."
And I'm sorry about that.
But that's just fall out from your dad and me.
"I know you're going through some tough times so, if you need anything..."
"Well, let me ask you something."
"You played basketball in high school, right?"
- Only for a little while.
- You didn't enjoy it?
What are you kidding me?
I loved it!
But there was no pressure then.
And then I didn't love it so much anymore.
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.
So then you just walked away?
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.
"It's just a game, Nate."
Not a life.
Hey spirit girl.
That cheerleading thing always throws me off.
What?
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it's just kind of our thing.
- Oh cool.
- What's up?
"So, um, I need some advice."
About Nathan.
I don't know if its crossing a line.
"Okay, funny wasn't what I was going for but.."
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess
"I'm everybody's go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?"
If it's too weird then...
"First off, I'm on my own after college, which is why I work so hard, and why I take opportunities when they come my way."
Not all of us get to live off a trust fund for the rest of our lives.
I'm not gonna be able to do that either.
Of course you are.
No.
My dad told me earlier.
He lost everything.
So I'm giving him my trust fund.
Why didn't you tell me this was going on?
Because I was embarrassed.
You're right.
I've never had to worry about money.
I feel stupid even complaining about it.
"I mean, other people have real problems."
"Sebastian, this is real."
And you shouldn't feel bad talking about it.
Are you sure you want to give your trust fund to him?
I don't think I can abandon him.
I guess I just don't have that killer instinct.
Aren't you worried he's gonna lose the money?
Yes.
But you're still gonna give it to him?
"Well, I already invested $25,000 in the company."
Too late to get that back.
But...
"Yeah, I'll give the rest to him."
"I mean, it's his money anyway."
He made it.
What will you do?
Will you have to move out?
I don't know.
"I mean, this place is rent-controlled."
Ok I already told Becca but since you asked... girls...
Jill you can just tell me later.
Stacy I'm so sorry...
I don't mean to spoil your special little moment.
But I have a huge announcement to make...
I'm getting married!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Do you love it?
It was the most amazing night you guys.
I don't want to just be your girlfriend anymore!
It's not that I don't...
love you...
"It's not fair, I can' take this limbo!"
I know...
You either marry me or you leave me!
It was the most romantic night of my life.
"What can I say, he's the best."
You've got to be kidding me!
"Drew, I'm sorry but he was hitting on me less than two months ago."
"Ok... he wasn't hitting on you, Hallie."
He was flirting with you.
"Guys are allowed to flirt, it's a human condition."
It's natural.
You think everyone is flirting with you.
I don't know I just think it's weird if a guy is ultra flirtatious... and in a committed relationship.
And not to mention that he's in the business.
Men in the entertainment industry are instinctively douche bags.
No?
No I like Drew.
I don't think he's a douche bag.
Well...
Who came up with the term douche bag anyway?
except to say that we probably don't want to be here when they arrived.
They ?
Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?
"Whatever , man."
Do you got any more cookies ?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
How about this.
"If you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are, and I'll throw in the recipe."
How're you going to do that dead ?
Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague ."
Again?
Yea.
Again.
"Don't worry, I won't move this time."
I'll be right here when you get back.
"I know we have to off this guy coz that's what we got to do, but I don't want to do it until I know why he wants us to do it."
"I mean, something's wrong here."
"What's this, Daze ?"
I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack a truck chucked full of cash and cologne to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.
I want this guy's story but getting it will just make our job harder.
I mean it changes everything.
that's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm.
And for that reason I think we shouldn't talk to him anymore.
That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.
He sure is.
How about those cookies?
"Oh, my God, this is gonna be so crazy."
Wow.
Has anyone made noise in here yet?
- We get pretty loud.
- Do you?
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, don't be worried about the volume."
- Okay.
- Yeah.
How much has it changed?
- Zero.
"- ""Zero."" Really, zero?"
It was how my parent...
"You know, they wanted to keep it just like they walked into it."
- Yeah.
- And that's what they did.
"They just said ""We're never gonna change..."
"Change it from that experience,"" you know."
Rad!
"Well, I'm going to Pat O'Brien's."
I'll see you guys.
This place is so thick with vibe.
You know?
"You just feel like, the sweat of generations you know, pouring off the walls."
"To see all our gear in there is a trip, you know?"
It's so out of...
It just seemed out of place.
"Like, ""Fuck, I hope we don't rattle the fucking building down or whatever, with the volume,"" you know?"
Originally it was built as a Spanish tavern.
And then over the years it's been a lot of things.
It was a photo studio where most of uptown aristocracy would come downtown and get their photos taken.
So you'd go into people's houses on St. Charles Avenue and you'd see their portraits in their Mardi Gras gowns and they're in the courtyard of Preservation Hall.
"Fredo, you're nothing to me now."
"Not a brother, not a friend."
"I don't want to know you, or what you do."
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
"When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there."
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.
There's more people than at a ballgame in here.
"-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!"
-Frankie Five-Angels...
This committee will come to order!
"-State your name, please."
-Frank PentangeIi.
-Where were you born?
"-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo."
Where do you live now?
I Iive in an army barracks with the FBI guys.
We have here a witness that will further testify to michael corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling.
This witness has had no buffer between himself and michael corleone.
He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against michael corleone.
-Senator.
"-Thank you, Chairman."
Mr. PentangeIi.
Mr. PentangeIi.
Were you a member of the CorIeone family?
"Did you serve under Caporegime, Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather?"
I never knew any Godfather.
I have my own family.
"Mr. PentangeIi, you..."
You are contradicting your own sworn statement.
What else can we do?
If they fight we must fight with them.
"And does it matter, after all, who wins?"
Was that ever really the question?
Will almighty God ask that question in the end?
"Police Department, zone one."
Sergeant Roberts.
The Polish Hill Strangler has claimed a fourth victim.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn was recovered from the Ohio River.
"Police had been alerted to the crimes by the killer,   who taunts them by playing the song ""Little Red Riding Hood""."
The police brutality trial of Detective Jimmy Detillo is over.
Detillo was convicted for the beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma.
The key to the conviction   was the testimony of Detillo's partner and cousin Thomas Hardy.
Hardy testified that his partner used unwarranted force.
"Come on, son, we're gonna be late for the policeman's ball."
- You've got to face him sometime.
- I feel like an asshole.
Maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
- I had you as a role model.
- You got that from your mother.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
"- Yeah, we're going out tomorrow."
What's the latest on Little Red Riding Hood?
"We get close, he slips away."
"I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop."
Maybe an ex-cop.
"Uncle Nick thinks so, too."
- Did you talk to him about Jimmy?
- We talked around it.
Did you wipe it off well?
Kim Young Joo's blood too...
You should wipe it off as well.
The one who killed Kim Young Joo was Cheon Jae Man.
Did you know?
You're no different from Cheon Jae Man.
He didn't kill those agents in the special task force himself either.
He merely borrowed the hands of others.
You dare put me in the same category as Cheon Jae Man?
!
The last person to be punished.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
The cruelest revenge you talked about...
Was it this?
Making me kill my real father by my own hands.
You've had quite a lot of fun these past 28 years.
Taking me away from my mom...
Making me believe someone else is my real father...
"Now, you're telling me to take revenge on my real father?"
That revenge...
I don't think I can do it.
Is it because he is your father by blood?
No.
"After becoming close to him, I saw he was an amazing President."
That amazing President you talk about...
Do you think he really got to that seat cleanly?
Choi Eung Chan...
I look forward to seeing your expression when you find out what he's really like.
Don't look forward to seeing my expression.
Things won't happen the way you want.
What Father wants...
That won't happen.
I want to be married to you.
Gregory... you are married to me.
"Right... that's right, that's right, yeah, right."
What?
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
"- Oh, that's all right, it'll pass, just hold on to me."
"Rose, don't ever leave me again."
I'm not leaving you...
I love you.
"I couldn't stand being away from you, it was killing me."
"Ah, I'm so glad."
"I don't care if you ARE pretty, I love you anyway."
"Listen, everything's gonna drop as I get older, and I'm gaining weight as we SPEAK."
"Well, that's comforting."
"- Get in, Lady."
"- Oh, no, not you again!"
- You know this guy?
- He's a good man.
"I can't believe this, your windows are still broke?"
"Complain to the cab company, I got nothing to do with it."
You can see that F of X equals E to Y...
"Times E to the X, which is what we were trying to prove."
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It's beautiful!
"It actually reminds me of a quote by Socrates,"
"""If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition in any degree,"
"""the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition."
"""Measure and symmetry are beauty, and virtue the world over."""
He's cute.
Do you think he's straight?
"Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay."
- Bees.
You know anything about bees?
I know somebody who knows somebody.
Ahem.
"Well, let me just say that I am sorry about your loss and I do accept credit cards."
The facts were these:
"One Kentucky Fitz, wife of Dusty  was the number-one Bee-Girl of Betty's Bees."
"Betty's Bees, trademark, was all the buzz in beauty and well-being  with honey and honey-based moisturizers  anti-aging creams, soaps and lip balms."
"Kentucky was 26 years, 3 weeks, 5 days and 39 minutes old  when found stung to death  behind the wheel of her Betty's Bees Bee Mobile."
- Which one is Kentucky Fitz?
- Biscuits.
- Biscuits?
"- You got biscuits, you got shrimps."
Biscuits.
Shrimps.
- You got something to flip her over?
- Why you gotta flip her over?
Front don't look no different and it ain't like you gonna be having a conversation.
It sure ain't.
Ooh.
Kentucky?
Maybe she's paralyzed from all the bee stings.
I'm just taking in my surroundings.
"Apparently, I'm dead."
- Really?
"Oh, I'm sorry but was your death accidental?"
Was I accidentally swarmed by bees?
No.
I may have been up to some mischief.
Your husband thinks what got you killed was some workplace romance gone sour.
And my husband has a problem with eavesdropping.
There was no romance.
- l don't want to hear of it!
And if a guest should leave me a tip for tidying up?
"No. I'll tell you something, you know what."
Yes.
You sometimes bring a tip from a wedding and you say:
"It was good, we got 150 crowns."
Don't pass judgment on me.
Don't compare yourself with me!
I'm just advising you.
But they may leave something there for me.
The main is for you to learn German.
"But if they leave money for me, what should I do?"
Don't complicate things again!
I'm afraid Mi?
ka might be naive.
She'll be easily taken in.
"I certainly don't want it to be like in that song, when he was tired of flying from one flower to another... I insist that when Mi?"
"ka one day falls in love, she should stay with him."
So she isn't a flighty little flower.
"Wait a minute, don't shut it!"
"Come on, quick!"
Our daughter's going to Austria and you shut the gates in front of us.
I keep saying they ought to make a footbridge here.
I know it's not your fault.
We're late because of you.
So many different hats and we miss the train.
But that's not our train!
"That's not our train, is it?"
"It's not, but we should already be there."
Come on!
Quick!
Quick!
You understand?
And and...
what elss?
"See this i have changed them, they were very old, i have spend the money."
See more carefully.
"You sold this car with lot of effect, and she was saying no."
"That's why Chandni made her unconscious, yeah Chandni?"
Yeah... yeah... if you were hitting her then why you were behind me?
Dad please think one more time.
"That's what i am thinking, we should leave its getting late."
200000000/-?
"Get some water madam is going unconscious, lets run with the car, this diamond is mine because this car is in my showroom."
Diamond is mine because the car is mine.
This diamond is four of us.
But what if Laxmi Narayan came to pick up the car then?
"Then we will sale him the car, what?"
But before that we will take out the diamond.
"You, never listen to me ever."
"Laxmi Narayan Jee i am Laila speaking, yeah?"
Can you come after one hour?
After one hour?
Actually papers will talk little time.
"All right, you know my nature right?"
I will come after one hour.
Quick.
Here it is...
don't be questioner... never questioner when someone is about to begin some work.
"Let's have coffee, coffee?"
Where will you hang around with this lets put it in locker.
Will it be safe in locker?
Take care of this beg i am coming in one hour.
504.
"Well then, let's get back to business, cos I'm late for my ballet class."
Finish the job or face the consequences.
Am I clear?
Well...
"I got news for you, Number One."
"Given the situation, I see why you're T.O and all."
"But, what's done is done."
And my partner comes first.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- It means... that if you try to take her out or get into the middle of our job, you're in front world of hurt!"
"I know what you're capable of, but we're pros too."
We also know that you're comin' now.
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was your age?
I don't either.
I like you kid.
"You're in over your head and you're scared, yet you look death in the eye without blinking."
"It's admirable, but it won't save you."
It won't save your partner and it won't save your new pal.
Finish the job or face the consequences.
You've got an hour.
Sorry about that stuff I said before.
What's them?
When I called you stupid and stuff.
That's okay.
Did you find anymore bullets all around?
Hey.
Wanna hear somethin'?
Your daughter doesn't hate you.
How do you know?
I know.
"Well, could you?"
You never even met her.
A girls' orchestra.
"She missed the tram, I caught up with her, officer, uniform.. she fell for it."
I greeted her and said:
I don't mind... wait... I said:
I don't mind escorting you even if it's several kilometres on foot.
Who wouldn't fall for that?
So I escorted her.
"Vinohrady, Streleck¨¢ 12... 23."
He's burbling on!
You missed the tram.
"I did, because it was... lt wasn't yet the Protectorate, but it was already looking gloomy."
I was impressed by the fact that she didn't want it:
Do you mind!
I have always been a protector of frail women.
"I was more frail than I am now, there's no arguing about that."
And she said to me:
"Slovaks have always impressed me, but not ones who go to pubs."
I said:
"D'you mind, I'm bored here."
"Where are those moments, the time I was young."
Then came the day when a dream died.
When a night moth stretched out its wings
A night moth in love means love's lost and in vain.
It flies into the darkness.
Love's both a joy and a pain.
I'm so worried about Mi?
ka.
What did you say?
That I'm worried about our Mi?
ka.
"I trust her, but I don't want her to experience some disappointment."
"She's going away for two months, to a new environment."
"Director Vance, what a surprise."
"I mean, not like a surprise."
"I mean, I know you have a special interest in this case because y-your family member is involved."
"No, that, that is not what I meant."
I-I am sure that your brother-in-law isn't involved.
"in anything at, at all."
"Ms. Sciuto, just proceed as if this were any other case."
Of course.
"Yes, sir."
So we know that the killer struck Petty Officer Adams hard and fast.
The wound is four inches in length and five inches in depth.
"The knife was stuck in once, to the abdomen."
The killer thrust it in deep and then tilted it up and pulled it out.
What's the weapon?
A five-inch boning knife like this one here.
It's the favorite of avid fishermen everywhere.
"The wound pattern matches the blade's design, but that's not all that matches."
The only prints on the body belong to none other than...
Petty Officer Brian Smith.
You have your guy.
"That's a good thing, right?"
"Hey, DiNozzo, search Petty Officer Smith's belongings."
Weapon's a fishing knife.
I want Michael released into my custody.
"Need to keep him close, Leon."
I'm taking him home tonight.
"Hey, Dad."
"All right, kids, that's enough of that for now."
Somebody here wants to say hello.
Hey.
Uncle Michael!
"What's up, man?"
Not that!
How can you think I'd tell him that?
"- Alan, I'm not accusing you."
"- Yes, you are."
"You're accusing me of this, and yet you refuse to accuse me of having an affair."
That hurts.
"Cory, I know you look up to your brother, but I want you to go to your father for advice on this subject."
Eric has some explaining to do about his own behavior with girls lately.
- I know.
- What do you know?
Pretty much everything.
I kind of walked in on them.
♪ Amazing grace... ♪
- On Eric and his friend in our room?
- How could this happen?
"Dad, Rebecca sat down on the bed and went like this..."
"Oh, so this is her fault."
And you bear no responsibility?
"- Clearly, I should have locked the door."
"- Eric, you're missing the point."
"No, I know the point, Dad."
"I should have controlled myself, but nothing happened."
"Eric, Eric, you are in so deep."
"Dad, I'm sorry."
"I mean, I'm really, really s..."
"You know, for thousands of years, fathers have said to their sons,"
"""Don't rush into sex,"" and the sons have always said, ""Yeah, sure."
"OK."""
"I didn't understand my father till this very moment, and you won't understand me till you're a father, which won't be for a very long time!"
- Dad?
- Learn her name!
"- Yes, sir."
Finally.
"Lucy, I'm home."
- How did you find this place?
"- Oh, you didn't know?"
Richie gets chatty in car rides.
"First him, now my Uncle Eddie?"
What the fuck is it with you?
Why do you keep messing with my family?
I think they call it destiny.
Then I guess you had this coming.
- What the hell's this?
- Are you kidding me?
- I will fucking kill you!
"- Hey, guys."
Hey!
Goddamn it!
Knock it off!
Get over there!
Get over there!
"First one to move, I swear to God I'll knock you on your ass."
You...
"You guys are unbelievable, you know that?"
I've been lookin' for a job like this for years.
"And you two punks show up outta nowhere and run roughshod all over it with all this ""get outta my sandbox"" bullshit?"
You know what you're like?
You're like... those lab rats.
"You know, the lab rats that push the button for the candy, they just keep pushin' again and again."
They don't give a shit about anybody or anything!
"This job is my swan song, my masterpiece."
"And once I pull this off,"
"I can sit around in my soft pants and watch my stories, think about that perfect caper that we  that we pulled off."
"So Seth, you either stand behind me, or you get the hell out of my way."
I think so.
It's alright.
Shh!
"See, Fen?"
No harm done.
Huh?
I wasn't hurt.
"- Fen was helping, I know."
- Pa.
Pa.
"It's alright, girl."
It's alright now.
Fen stabbed Hugo de Jaager.
She was trying to protect Mr. Travis.
You caught your murderer.
"Makes you happy, does it?"
You're going to advocate for Fen to remain at the asylum.
Yes... though I can hardly argue that she wasn't in her right mind when she stabbed Mr. de Jaager.
"She was attacking a man she thought was harming her father, a perfectly rational action."
"But she didn't have men's rea, a guilty mind, so I have considerable leeway."
Can she be helped?
I don't know.
"But with further attention and care, she may be able to learn to control her wildness."
And become civilized.
(Julia sighs.)
"Given the behaviour of some of the so-called civilized people we encounter in our work, I wonder what we'd be teaching her."
"Well, she did show us that she's capable of empathy, Julia, by attempting to protect Mr. Travis the way she did."
It is the hallmark of humanity.
"No matter what we may think of him as a man, she saw him as her father."
"William, there's something I have to tell you."
(Julia sighs.)
"You have to look your best, little man."
You are not my mother.
And you are not my child.
"You know, since we're talking, with mouths -- not really an opportunity that comes along very often --"
"I just want to say, you know, you have never been very reliable."
And you have?
You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.
"No, but I always took you where you needed to go."
You did.
"Look at us, talking!"
"Wouldn't it be amazing, if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?"
You know I'm not constructed that way.
I exist across all space and time and you talk and run around and bring home strays.
I do really feel like they're soulmates.
"They're best friends, they're siblings, they're family."
They can't live without each other.
You can't have one without the other.
"In the top 3 saddest moments of ""Doctor Who"""
was when the TARDIS had to go back to being a TARDIS.
She just wanted to say
"""Hello."""
I'm alive.
"""Alive"" isn't sad."
It's sad when it's over.
"I'll always be here, but this is when we talked and, now, even that has come to an end."
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.
Goodbye.
No.
I just wanted to say hello.
"Hello, Doctor."
Doctor.
"It's so very, very nice to meet you."
So what are you after?
Reaching for the moon?
Nope.
Just one little star.
On a dressing room door.
"Want to be a playactress, huh?"
"Oh, i am one."
I barnstormed through the midwest for two seasons.
This is the only job i could get in new york.
But i don't care - at least i'm in a theater.
"Before i get through, i'm going to be a great actress."
That's the way to say it.
"Think big, talk big, and you'll be big."
"Say, you're a good looker."
Got the spirit of a thoroughbred.
All you need is a little sprucing up.
"Here, get into this."
You and me are going to paint the town.
"I've got some acting for you to do, and you'll put that fleurique in the shade."
But these are her clothes.
That's stealing.
Only little people steal.
Big people call it borrowing.
But-but what will mademoiselle say?
I can't wear her clothes.
You certainly can't wear that hired gal's rig where we're going.
Where are we going?
To the astor house.
You've got a sight of gall.
And i'm daring you to show some.
"She threw things at you, didn't she?"
"Listen, when you're scratching for corn and another chicken comes along and shoves you out of the way, get right back into that circle and make the feathers fly."
I haven't been saying anything!
You don't think I have enough problems without people thinking
I'm going around stomping other people's teeth out?
Do I need that?
!
Then who's been saying it then?
"There's ""Got your back"" guys and ""I'll be back"" guys."
Greg!
"Greg was a ""I'm running like a bitch"" guy."
"You two, in my office now."
Dr. Raymond hated his job because he didn't get paid enough.
"* Relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it... *"
So he blew off steam by dancing the nights away with a few close friends.
"* Relax, don't do it, when you want to step to it *"
"* Relax, don't do it... *"
You think I like calling you into my office?
Uh... or it could be a rupture of the blood vessels in the... subcutaneous tissue.
A hickey.
"15 years of marriage, and it's like no time's passed at all."
He's still playing around.
Poor thing.
"Officers, if you need any help, please don't hesitate."
Krystal Sneed.
I organized the event.
I know everybody here.
Any idea who might've given Patrick the love bite ?
Um... just between us ?
Patrick used to always make time with the undesirables.
He cheated on Jennie three times senior year.
Any of those ladies here today ?
Michelle Day.
Wouldn't exactly call her a lady.
Those are exactly the same pictures.
Come to think of it... you sure do look like Suzukichi.
You are like two peas in a pod.
That's really something!
- Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
- Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes glares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, let's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'll devote himself to flirting with Clark's daughter.
Will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
Emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
"Be there, Thursday church, or never after look me in the face."
- I...
- Speak not.
"Reply not, do not answer me."
My fingers itch!
"My lord, you're in the wrong, my lord, to punish her."
Is that my lady wisdom's view?
Take care.
You dice with your place in talking thus.
May not one speak?
"Oh, will you be quiet, you fool!"
- Now...
"- No, husband, you are too hot."
"God's blood, it does make me mad!"
"Day, night, month, year!"
My constant care... has been to have my only child worthily matched.
"And here I find an educated man of equal birth with honorable parts, with fine estates and handsome to behold, and what is my reward?"
"A puking fool, who answers, ""I'll not wed."
I cannot love.
I am too young.
"I pray you pardon me."""
Now think on this.
Thursday is near.
"If you will play the bride, then are you my daughter and all is forgot."
"If you will not, then you are mine no more."
Graze where you will.
You shall not house with me.
"Beg, starve or hang,"
"I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor pass to you the slightest thing that's mine."
"I swear to this, my word, so help me God!"
How can Father speak so to a child who loves him better than she loves herself?
"Oh, oh, God."
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?
You see the basketball court?
"Mr. President, can I ask you a question for my YouTube channel?"
- That'd be all right.
What's your name?
- Emily Cale.
"Emily Cale, go ahead."
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?
I wasn't ready for a press conference.
How do you expect 22 Arab nations with different regional and religious interests to agree on a single treaty especially given the newly erupting conflicts between the Shiites and the Sunnis in southern Pakistan?
Tough question.
"To be honest with you, I don't know."
"Whether they'll agree or not I'm not sure, but I gotta try."
The day we stop believing different people can come together is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.
What I am ready to do is give a little girl a shout-out on her YouTube blog.
"Hi, folks, my name is James W. Sawyer and I'm here with Emily Cale and her video blog."
Check it out.
- You have a good one.
- Wait.
"Mr. President, this is my dad John."
He's gonna be on your Secret Service detail.
Secret Service detail.
Is that right?
"You know, I take my protection detail very seriously."
"- Yes, sir."
- Stop lying to children.
"- Nice to meet you, Emily."
"- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President."
You guys have a good one.
You hungry?
Want to go out?
Tired.
"Yeah, all right."
I need to tell you what I found out about Ronan Murphy.
"What, you looked into it?"
Murphy was a person of interest in the inquiry into the murder of Tommy Hunter.
In what way?
Ronan Murphy was one of Hunter's closest associates.
We never interviewed him.
Major Violent Crime did.
Ronan Murphy was interviewed about the conspiracy Lindsay Denton was convicted of?
Looks like it.
None of this was in the file.
It must been doctored.
You didn't get any of this from me.
"Well, well..."
Who'd have thought?
What are you after?
You ever heard the name Ronan Murphy?
Why d'you ask?
Just thought you might have heard the name.
Are you reopening my case?
"Forget it, all right?"
That's not why I'm asking.
"Look, I don't expect you to care, Steve, but I'm never, ever going to get back to being that person that I was before all this happened."
"You know, the only thing that kept me sane, the thing that got me up in the morning, was being a police officer."
"I want to find the people that framed me, Steve, and I believe..."
"Well, I HOPE that you do, too."
The audio file on this phone is as embarrassing to you as it is to me.
"Believe you me, I've got it backed up."
I don't enjoy threatening people.
Of all the fucking people.
She gave up everybody.
"Jimmy, me."
Even her brother.
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.
"Judge gave Jimmy and me ten years, like he was giving away candy."
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney Generals office.
"Toast, guys."
"Good trip, good life."
Get out soon.
"Good trip, sweetheart."
We'll watch the home front.
"Say hello to those blow-job hacks, huh?"
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
"I'll call you, uh, when I get a chance."
Now take me to jail.
"In prison, dinner was always a big thing."
"We had a pasta course, then we had a meat or a fish."
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt and he had a wonderful system for doing the garlic.
He used a razor and sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.
It was a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
"veal, beef, and pork."
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
"I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce."
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.
"I didn't put too much onions in, Paul."
You made me crazy.
"You,like,told me to look for the signs."
"Like bird poop and lightning bolts or,like,actual signs?"
"I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a lot of signage out there in the world."
I told you only to pay attention to the really obvious ones.
"The signs,thus far,have been conflicting."
Would you like me to come with you and show you the correct ones?
I could ring a bell and point.
"This is not about me,okay?"
A very nice person could get hurt.
Nice people get hurt every day.
"Sometimes,it's good for them."
"Did I,like,screw you out of land during the Renaissance or something?"
Why do you hate me so much?
- This is me liking you.
"- Well,can you stop?"
"And,seriously,how are you so slim?"
Here's what you got right.
Ready?
It's not just about you.
That's all you're getting.
"You want a burger,baby?"
No.
So how am I the stupidest person in the world?
When did that happen?
I think you've been working towards that for a while.
I am totally stuck.
I cannot break up with him again.
"He's the most loving,open guy."
All he wants to do is give and share.
The absolute worst word you can use to describe a guy is what?
"""Busty""? ""Emotional."""
No.
Where's your mother?
I'm traveling all alone.
And you started wandering around the train and now you don't know where you're supposed to be?
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no!"
"I mean, I..."
"I do know where I'm supposed to be, in the day coach, but I don't like it there very much."
"I don't feel so good, right here."
I bet I know your problem.
You do?
Mmm-hmm.
"They gave you money to buy your dinner, and instead of that you bought some ice cream, and some candy and maybe some soda pop?"
"Yeah, and some marshmallows, and some cotton candy, and popcorn and cigarettes."
Cigarettes?
"Oh, I mean can-candy cigarettes, chocolate."
Oh!
Why don't you sleep here?
Here?
I'm sure your mother would want you looked after.
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no, don't do that."
Why?
"Oh, well, he doesn't like me, see, and... and he's not a nice man because we were talkin' about trains, and I told him I had 13 cars in my set,"
"and he only has 11, and he's jealous and nasty, he is."
"All right, then."
I'll ring for the porter.
"Oh, no."
"If you press that buzzer, I'll be killed!"
What an imagination!
"Well, don't you see?"
The porter and the conductor are in cahoots against me.
They stick his hand in this weird --
"I don't know, contraption and, while he's going through it, he's explaining to us that, like,"
"""oh!"
"It's taking a tissue sample."""
Ow!
And extrapolated it.
Some kind of accelerator?
Agh!
Are you all right?
I don't know.
"That's just -- and then, all of a sudden, this, like, gorgeous 16-year-old girl walks out of this unit and he's like"
"""Oh!"
"That's my daughter."""
Arm yourself.
Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Who is she?
"Well, she's -- well..."
She's my daughter.
"Hello, Dad."
"They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples from other people, which is weird."
"Now he's a father, which is a great way to have a kid."
"All those years, he didn't have to not sleep because the kid was up, crying, or having to go to school because of chickenpox."
"Hello, Dad."
"In the same way that Jenny came out of nowhere, at the end of the episode, she kind of awesomely goes into nowhere."
It's very sad.
The Doctor gets a clone and so then there's another Time Lord and you think about the potential for adventures and everything that he could've taught her and shown her and then it's snatched away so quickly.
"Jenny, be strong, now."
You need to hold on.
Do you hear me?
"Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down right there.
You should have seen him.
His eyes were-were crazy.
Just 'cause he changed the channel?
"No, no, bro, wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first-class airfare, seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel all-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of The Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now."
"And since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue, we're throwing in $1 million!"
She's the reason that Dawkins broke out of prison?
She just won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
"Okay, but why her?"
"Like, there's not enough rich people on this island?"
"She's away from home, she's out of her element."
Maybe Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
I need everything on Dana.
Okay?
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rental."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
That's it.
It matches the description of the car Dawkins stole.
Five-O.
We'll take it from here.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
Food or water?
- There's no actual dolphins or boys.
"- (Stephen) No, it's..."
He's really short.
Stands on a box.
Or she...
They had to dig a trench for her.
Five to you.
She had to stand and walk about in a trench.
"The interesting thing about Alan Ladd was he was only, like, four foot three, but it was all his legs that were short."
"Like, his trunk was normal."
"- Sat down, he was taller than most people."
- Is that true?
Good heavens.
"But when he stood, yeah, they had to put him on a little apple crate."
I never know with you.
That's what's so worrying.
"- No, it's absolutely true."
- (laughter)
"Alan Ladd was to recall working with Sophia Loren in Boy on a Dolphin, that ""Working with her was like being bombarded by watermelons""."
- Ha!
- (Stephen) Exactly.
Thank you.
"For the sake of our audience who hadn't quite got that image, thank you for it."
As Woody Allen - Mr Konigsberg - once pointed out:
"""Sex between a man and a woman can be wonderful, provided you get between the right man and the right woman""."
"Now, lastly on the subject of Alans, what would you do with a pair of Alans?"
Australians should know this because it's one of the particular ways of speaking
"Australia shares with Britain, or particularly with London."
- Alan Whickers.
- Alan Whickers.
Knickers.
There you are.
"Secondly, she prefers the term"
"""Adult Film Thespian."""
"And thirdly, I had a very good conversation with her, and hopefully, she's gonna stop doing..."
"Hundreds of men, women and objects?"
She doesn't do objects.
"She has a standard contract, and she doesn't do objects."
"She doesn't do animals, and she doesn't do water sports."
Although I don't really know what that is.
I think that's...
doing it on a jet ski?
"Oh, boy."
Yep.
Why would anyone want to do that on a jet ski?
"Okay, so what?"
- Were you able to talk her out of it?
- I think so.
Although she did most of the talking.
"If it wasn't for you, I never would have gotten to where I am today."
Thank you.
"You made me fall in love with math, Aaron."
"And with those skills, I've learned to invest my money, run my own website, and create a healthy and diversified portfolio."
That's cool.
That is really cool.
"You know, I think that I'm just curious if-if maybe you're interested in expanding."
"Oh, I totally do!"
I'm gonna start my own reality show where I take other porn stars out to dinner.
It's called Stuffing Liza Blue's Face.
Wow.
Great title.
God.
"You know, I love how encouraging you are."
That's why I've always had such a big crush on you.
"Just take your time, and while you're at it, you might want to tighten your socks, because they're about to get knocked off."
Why did you tell him that we have a great idea?
"Honey, what do you think, one's just gonna walk in the front door?"
"And now, thanks to you,"
I have to wear this stupid eye patch.
It's not my fault.
Face it.
"You liked me when I was mousy, and now that that's changed, you can't handle it."
Nonsense!
All I've ever been is a protective big sister.
"Then how come when you had an eyebrow-waxing business, you never got rid of my unibrow?"
Why would you want me to?
So you could be sexy for God?
That's sick.
So tell me the idea.
"It's a story about two sisters,"
Joy and Jill.
One was mousy her whole life because she was a mouse.
Ah!
"They're both mice, and the other mouse was always the beautiful one."
"Right, but then, they switched."
Sounds interesting.
"You know, mice do well in focus groups."
Melanie and I are artists.
We don't cater to focus groups.
And how does your story end?
"Well, what kind of endings do focus groups like?"
The kind that are in my hand by Monday.
Then you will have it by Sunday.
What is wrong with you?
I'm ready.
How do I look?
It was my fault.
- What you sorry about?
I am not.
Then let's just say that we were foolish and next time we'll drink to one another's health.
I suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.
Yes.
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.
"Well, goodbye and good luck."
"Come on, John."
Don't be stuffy.
"After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else."
I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment.
"- What do you mean, ""off moment""?"
"- Yours, according to your theory."
"I imagine what I just witnessed was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good, huh?"
Correct?
"Yes, yes."
"I don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack."
"But one which would have been repulsed even without your help, John."
Wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
That's where you'll find me from tonight on until I get what I'm looking for.
"I'm worried, John."
- He ought to have let us know.
- He'll be along.
"Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll."
That wasn't my son in there.
It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart.
My poor Sam.
"- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home."
"- Yes, sir."
- I'll walk.
"Those are my orders, I can't stand hooligans."
You've come at a good time.
It's about the meeting.
"I told the boss, he wants us to follow procedure."
"You know what to do, so get over there."
What are you doing here?
"Take the kids, quick!"
"Come here, Naou."
"Wait here, I'll be back in a while."
"Good day, Touré."
How are you?
And the family?
"Today I've come to thank you, for the work you did with my wife."
It was a complete success.
My wife adores me.
And all thanks to God and your work.
- I thank you.
- Give thanks to God!
To his Grace!
"Today, my main concern in this visit... is the factory."
"In these violent times, it's enough to wear a new shirt... to awaken envy, even if the person... is not concerned."
I come to you for protection.
I've told you Traoré is evil.
"And now the workers have stopped working, to go to the meeting."
Who could have lightened the work load?
It's the new engineer.
He's reduced the cloth price.
"And when such a person calls a meeting, to discuss our problems, I think it's... something good, that we should... all value."
What do you say?
You're right.
"Our union delegates are a bunch of stool-pigeons, trust them... and you'll bury yourself alive."
So let's fire them!
"Oh, yes."
No.
"Yeah, probably, I am."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Well... it was a great two-and-a-half dates.
And I'd be willing to round it up to three if you want to.
I don't think so.
"I hope you're sure about this, because once I leave, I'm not coming back."
Unless you want me to.
"Bye, New Christine."
Bye.
That is one hot grandpa.
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
Please tell me.
What can you achieve by talking?
What can be achieved?
That is already out of control.
"Soon, I'll be killed by that."
"To you, it doesn't matter if you survive or die, but to me, I must definitely kill it."
"In order to do that, I need you to talk."
"The one who turned it into a demon was you, and thus, you have an obligation to talk."
Obligation?
It is just a grudge filled story.
"I have wasted my life living to this age, to actually be intimidated by that..."
Final Act
"That girl, Tamaki was a sacrificial offering."
"It slowly became inevitable, as if and leaned towards me."
"Because of how things ended up, it would have been pitiful if I had taken her home."
"So, I let her wear beautiful clothes and eat delicious food."
"- We're all gonna die, Elliot."
The only question is when and how?
What?
You pulled Bianco's LUDs?
Swell.
- Fin?
- Yeah.
Amy Solwey's been calling Bianco.
Everyone who needs a kidney knows about Russ Bianco.
What's the big deal?
"Well, you called him a couple dozen times over the last two months."
You're at the top of the NTCC list.
What do you need a guy like that for?
Insurance.
In case my next transplant doesn't work.
Really?
What is Bianco paying you to find buyers for his hot kidneys?
I do it for nothing.
"Going to jail for assisted suicide didn't teach you a damn thing, did it?"
Sure it did.
Now I help people live instead of die.
"Amy, you're still breaking the law."
Arrest me.
"We don't want you, we want the surgeon who's performing the transplants."
He's saving lives.
"Give us his name, or you're going back to jail."
No jail's worse than living in the prison of a sick body.
You'll be living in both when they take your name off that transplant list.
That would never happen.
"When the NTCC finds out that you've been trafficking in black market kidneys, they're gonna cross you right off the list."
You'd let me die?
Give us the surgeon's name.
I've been traipsing across this bridge for days now.
Seems I have a long way to go still.
I should be on my way.
Excuse me.
- What do you expect me to do?
- Just stand aside.
And risk falling over the side for a perfect stranger?
Away and bow your head.
You stand aside!
My destination lies at the opposite end of the bridge.
And you'll get there after you back up and I reach that end of the bridge first.
That would waste too much time and time is what I don't have.
So you think you're better than me because you're in a hurry.
"Well, I'm in a hurry too!"
"But, no, you did not think of that, did you?"
That I might be an equal.
No!
"You just consider yourself superior, right off."
You're rude.
"You mistake my comment, sir."
Do I?
You think I'm dumb too?
"No, I..."
"Look, we are both in a hurry."
So I shall hang from these planks and you may walk over.
So you get a peek up my kilt?
That is not what I am suggesting.
"- So you say, you plucky-faced hing-oot!"
- What did you call me?
"So you're deaf too, you clagtail cuddle dreik!"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll fight for it to the finish.
It's completely isolated.
"He can beat, torture, or burn somebody, and nobody would hear it."
I never thought the FBI would be here for our fine city's tradition.
I'm Al Garner with the DFD.
Agents Morgan and Prentiss.
"I guess Devil's Night keeps you pretty busy, huh?"
Not as much as it did in the '80s.
"Used to get up to 600, 700 fires back then."
- In three days?
- Down to 115 last year.
It still takes everything we got.
"Fortunately, we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the Rivertown district?
"I wish they could, but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's Finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
[Door opens]
[Prentiss] A thousand volunteers?
"[Morgan] Well, that just added another thousand names to Garcia's list."
- Do you think he's one of them?
- Can't rule anyone out.
What is this place?
It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
Medieval.
"And from the Industrial Age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world."
This is where we found Tony's charred remains.
"Well, the char pattern tracks back to here."
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
It's not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
"Yeah, except he didn't want that."
Moriarty's mechanical dragon attacks a speeding locomotive... and they steal a parrot that belongs to one of the passengers.
"Meanwhile, Holmes finds out that there's a relationship... between the parrot and Indian merchant who's gone missing."
What will the parrot tell us?
"If you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at Baker Street."
Game of Wits!
Parrot vs Professor
"Ladies and gentlemen, did you hear?"
"Get them, please, get off the plane."
Mrs. Dexter...
"Look, look, she's just had two very long flights."
If you would be patient-
"It's all right, Dex."
They're just doing their job.
King Galen will be coming off the plane any minute.
Could you please stand back and give a little room?
"How is he, Mrs. Dexter?"
And where's Prince Michael?
- Prince Michael is on the plane with His Majesty.
"Now, he's unconscious and he's still very sick."
- How did you get him out of Moldavia?
Did you pay the government?
We issued a press release when we changed planes in New York.
You should have that information within the hour.
"- Look, here they come."
Please stand back.
Clear the way.
Please stand back.
Alexis told me once when we were married:
"""Blake, there is nothing on this planet that I can't do, including the impossible."""
"I guess she proved that to the world, hasn't she?"
Darling.
"Oh, I don't know, Nate."
We can't just leave her in the grizzled hands of a predator.
"- Well, we can't take her either."
- Why not?
Because that would be abducting her.
"I know, but she's just a child, Nate."
"Mm-hmm, and that's called child abduction, which is a crime, unlike what they're doing."
So you're just gonna side with him?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do!
"You think you're saving her from beautiful life as wife of rich doctor, followed by even better life as widow of rich doctor with no heirs?"
"Well, there has to be more to marriage than money."
- You think she gold digger?
"- No, I think you gold digger."
Look at you with your bracelets and that ring.
That ring.
I need you to tell me what he said.
I want you to leave now.
"Please, Mr Lee!"
I'm his mother!
Get out!
You coward!
"Mrs McCarthy, what a lovely hat."
It makes you look like royalty.
If only!
Mrs McCarthy... have you heard of a new restaurant in Cheltenham called
Gerard's Brasserie?
I was wondering if you'd care to join me there tomorrow lunchtime.
"Well, I have a WI meeting."
The speaker runs a cattery in Painswick.
"Well, surely the WI can do without you for one day."
"No, I don't think I will."
"Then I think I'd better be going, too."
Since my being here is useless.
"You don't mind, do you?"
"I must say, what a letdown."
"Really, all that trouble for nothing."
"It's your fault, sending a telegram like that."
That's enough!
Don't you blame Tateo.
I made him write that.
But...
I don't see what is wrong about writing the truth.
Stupid!
"They did drop the atom bomb, and they resent being reminded of it?"
"If they don't like it, they don't have to remember it."
But I can't have them pretending ignorance.
They claim they dropped the flash to stop war.
It's already been 45 years now.
But the flash hasn't stopped war.
They're still killing people!
But you know... war is to blame.
People do anything... just to win a war.
"Sooner or later, it will be the ruin of all of us."
"Now, let's go to the arrival lobby."
There's still time before he comes out.
But...
I feel sort of depressed.
If he came here because of what my mother said...
I don't want to meet Clark.
Shall we run away?
I feel really awkward about introducing Clark to Grandma.
So do I. But it can't be helped.
Don't you think what we are doing might not be the right thing to do to Clark?
- I just gotta put out a fire for a client.
- Can we talk about that later?
- This is more important.
- Wayne:
"I thought you were gonna tell me it was something important, like a testicular cancer scare."
"No, not that important, but still nonetheless, it's important."
More important than bringing your team to Vegas?
"I only stuck around for this lunch, Spencer."
I'm heading back to LV today.
Jet is washed and the Joe's Stones are on ice.
"- Vern, what's up?"
Wish I had better news.
"- Wayne, yeah, I understand."
"I get it, it's only a onetime pass."
"- Yeah, it happened again."
- It's not gonna happen again.
"Yeah, he's more than a little upset, Vernon."
"- Wayne, hold on one second."
- He's cutting you.
Cutting me or cut me?
What tense did he use?
"What the fuck does it matter what tense he used, Vernon?"
- Jesus Christ.
Come on.
- You didn't listen.
"What the fuck are we gonna do, Joe?"
Me and Spencer are heading there now.
We are gonna beg for mercy.
"You are gonna fucking divest yourself of the entire weed business ASAP, you hear me?"
"First off, calm the fuck down when you talk to us, man."
We ain't done nothing that wasn't in accordance with Colorado state law.
"- Reggie, please stop talking."
He--he's near the top of the list.
"UNOS will find him his organs, when they find him his organs."
And God knows that staying up all night chatting about it is not gonna help.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.
I suggest you do the same.
He's running out of time.
They always are.
Welcome to peds.
Of all of the tools on a surgical tray...
Sound judgment is the trickiest one to master.
"And without it, we're all just toddlers running around with 10-blades."
"Oh, I asked them not to wake you."
"I said, ""Whatever it is, it can wait till morning""."
"""Dr. Shepherd needs his beauty sleep""."
Your latest head CT shows that the brain contusions are expanding.
I'm gonna get you into the OR right away.
This--this brain thing.
It--it could kill me?
"If we don't treat it, yes."
You find that funny?
I'm sorry.
It's just that they're gonna execute me in five days.
Five days.
"Might as well take my chances with this brain thing, right?"
- Mr. Dunn--
"- You gotta admit, it's a nice way to go."
Plenty of attractive females.
All the jell-o I could want.
Have you tried the strawberry?
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?
"Either way, I'm going to die, dr."
Soon-shin...
I'm sorry to cause you concern once again.
Don't be silly.
We heard everything from outside.
I can' let you go alone.
I will round up the members of Deung-ryong and we will go together.
No!
"What do you mean, Master?"
Why are you stoping us?
"If we send him alone, there is no telling what they might do."
That's a cross Soon-shin alone must bear.
"I cannot obey you, Master."
I refuse to let him go alone!
Are you going to turn Deung-ryong institute into a martyrs' den?
Master...
"Kyun, Master is right."
Soon-shin!
What are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?
You wish to make a deal?
That's right.
"If I don't return by 7:00 pm, your journal will be turned over to the Court of Equity."
Fool.
How are you going to prove that journal is mine.
You can't bring me down that easily.
"No, I can't prove anything."
"Even if I could, I'm sure your connections in the Courts of Equity will make that proof disappear."
If you now that why would be so foolish?
But if copies of that journal are delivered to Attendant Ju and Prime
"Minister Yoon, what then?"
"Along with a note saying that the original has been delivered to the Court of Equity as well, of course."
What?
- You're all right.
"Somebody's going to snap you up, wait and see."
You saw what happened in Boise.
What happened?
Didn't you see all the guys in the diner breaking their necks to look you over?
- I didn't see that.
- Sure.
How often does a girl like you come into a place like that anyway?
"Now, you see, in the morning we'll take the old elevator down... and we'll be on our way."
I wish it could have been you.
It would have been better.
You go to sleep.
I think you should go back.
Back where?
He wasn't even sure where he was.
- What if it was them?
- He wasn't sure.
You did the right thing.
Let the National Guard go look.
- It's what they're there for.
"- Ladies, would you mind holding it down?"
I'm trying to think.
- What if it was my brother that was down?
"- Now, quit!"
I don't even want to think about that.
- Edgar'd go after him.
- You don't know that for sure.
I think he would.
"You marry a mail-plane pilot, see how anxious you are to send him off in one."
"When the time comes, we all have to take care of each other."
Nobody else will.
You'd hold your breath every time he left and wouldn't let it out until he'd come home.
"I'll join you in a moment, babe."
Sit down.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know better than to talk in front of her.
The price of beef is going up too fast in New York.
They feel a congressional investigation is imminent.
"So, what do they want from me?"
A four cent drop for the next six months.
[Laughing]
"Six months, huh?"
Do you know how much that'll cost me?
"Hey, you seem like a smart, young man."
"You tell me, what am I paying' those guys down there for, anyway, huh?"
Can't they do something about it?
They are doing something about it.
They're giving you a warning that could save us a lot of aggravation.
You can't afford to be too greedy.
It's not like the old days.
"All right, all right, all right."
Work it out!
But don't you give me no crap about the old days.
"At least, in the old days, you could understand the comics."
"Today, all they got is cosmic ducks and star shit."
"Now, you get outta here."
Don't you come back until you have something I wanna hear.
"Okay, Mr. pontivini."
Whatever you say.
"- Hi, tom."
"- Hey, Ralph."
"Very good, thank you, very good."
"Listen, Ralph, uh..."
"I'm lookin' for the girls that were with those, uh, ghetto ghouls on the night they were killed."
Months ago.
"Look, I'm in love with Adrian."
All right?
"She doesn't want to think about getting married right now, but I want to marry her."
"She met my mother last Sunday, after church."
What?
"All right, then, we should disperse."
Get going.
(CLEARING THROAT)
I can't believe this.
Amy is married and
Adrian is semi-engaged or something and I'm not even allowed to date.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous times call for ridiculous measures.
Like?
Like staying home and studying and focusing on getting into college.
Getting an education prepares you for life.
Getting an education helps you think.
Thinking is a skill in itself.
"Look, say what you want about school, but life is all about does the boy get the girl?"
Does the girl get the boy?
Or does the boy get the boy?
Or does the girl get the girl?
"Or any of that, all of that!"
"I understand what you're saying, but let me put it another way."
Every relationship is a school.
Every person you meet is a teacher.
"If you don't like learning things in school, you're probably going to have a few problems learning from people."
"Now, that's ridiculous."

Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
-What for?
I got pinched.
"-Everybody gets pinched, but you did it right."
-You told them nothin' and they got nothin'.
-l thought you'd be mad.
"I'm not mad, I'm proud of you."
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
What?
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
Oh ho...
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
"By the time I grew up, there was 30 billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport, and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it."
"See, ya gotta understand, we grew up near the airport."
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place... and they would tip us off about what was coming in and what was moving out.
If any of the truckers or airlines gave us any trouble Paulie had his union people scare them with a strike.
It was beautiful.
It was an even bigger money maker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.
"Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport."
"To us, it was better than Citibank."
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just oId-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
"Shut down, always trying to be the tough guy."
Do you know how many times I cried in a helmet?
I'm fine.
Your engagement broke off last week.
Now you're sleeping on the couch of a guy whose middle name you probably don't even know.
Patrick.
"Fine, we're best friends."
But you can't tell me you're not hurting right now.
"Look, honestly, I don't know how I'm feeling, okay?"
"There's a lot of things going on in my mind right now, and I just need to sort some things out."
"We will, I promise you."
Two nights on my couch and I will get inside of you.
Feel like we got off to a weird start.
It's so nice out.
I know.
"Walking outside, in the fresh air..."
We should get a treadmill.
"You know, it's so weird that lily and Neal actually broke up."
"I know, it's a classic story."
"Couple falls in love, decides to get engaged, disaster and heartbreak follow."
What kind of fairy tales were you read as a kid?
"My favorite one was called ""eviction notice,"""
where the princess had to move to a new castle.
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.
Did your dad ever hug you?
"Aw, come here."
"Mm, not like that."
"Well, I can think of some other things your dad never did to you."
"- Okay, first of all, ew."
- Mm.
"Second of all, ew."
All right.
Will it be fine if I just give it to you?
Then we have a deal.
A contract?
Didn't you say that you will definitely pay me back?
No need to look to know that you still want to be a driver.
Why don't you just be my driver?
I'm not that familiar with South Korea.
You can also help me run errands.
I'll pay you 25 000 Won to be my driver and also to run errands.
Two hundred times should be enough for a total of five million Won.
Two hundred times?
You don't want to?
Then don't repay me.
Why so urgent?
Where do I need to sign?
It won't be easy.
"Even if it's going to be tiring, I will not give up."
Over there.
- President?
- Now?
"This is the graduate from MIT, Dr. Lee Yun Seong."
Information and Communication sector's dark horse.
(Dark horse - is a term used to describe a little-known person.)
I heard that you also got an invitation from United States.
Why did you choose to come to South Korea instead?
Money?
My father has earned a lot.
He will definitely let me inherit it.
So I don't feel the need to serve the United States.
"So, you are a patriot."
"Mr. President, being under your service is a big honor, and it can't be compared to any other thing."
You have beautiful legs.
Thank you.
"I'm a bit too tall, aren't I?"
"No, you're perfect."
You look great.
"No, I'm too tall."
I wish I could cut them short.
"Come on, don't do that."
"Director Kim, guess you got to work on your script now."
I guess so.
What is it about this time?
I only have the title.
"""About Miracles."""
Does it sound too scholarly?
"""About Miracles,"" I see."
"- ""About Miracles."""
- Miracle?
What kind of miracle?
A man travels to a foreign beach and stays at a hotel.
And in his room he plays Mozart on his CD player.
Then he leaves his room and hears the same music on the lift.
"He walks out of the hotel, then takes a turn at the corner, and on the street is a clown."
He's doing his mime to the exact same music.
It's an incredible coincidence.
But this man doesn't think it's a mere coincidence.
He wonders why he heard the same music three times.
"And he concludes that if he can find the reason why this happened, he can unravel a secret to the world."
And he's obsessed with that thought.
So he starts tracking hints.
For ten years.
"First, he begins with info about the clown, the women he met, his preferences, everything."
Down to the speaker's brand in the hotel elevator.
"In ten years, you'll be a forty year old ahjussi."
"At that point, today will appear like a faded, yellowed old photograph."
"Without even knowing it, you'll realize you've already let go."
"After that, the days will continue to build on top of each other, and you'll be like a fossil from the dinosaur age to me."
Too depressing?
"This is Lee Seo Yeon, I wasn't able to reach the quota."
"No matter how hard I tried to lengthen it, I just couldn't do anymore."
Did you send the manuscript?
I'm calling because I've been waiting.
"I sent it, you didn't receive it?"
"No, I didn't."
Where did it go off to?
Emails lately have been arriving hours later than usual.
I sent it last night around ten or eleven.
"Anyway, I definitely sent it."
It's hard to believe an email you sent last night still hasn't arrived.
"Anyway, please send it again."
"All right, I just got home, I'll send it right away."
"All right, thank you."
Yes.
I sent it.
"I sent it, I definitely sent it."
I sent it.
Welcome!
I decided to make curry today.
It's going to be amazing.
What's wrong?
What?
Be quiet.
Did you lose something you've been working on?
I said be quiet!
Why are you getting angry?
I'm not.
You're perfectly justified to hate him.
I'm saying he's really gone back for me.
He's always been a good friend to me.
That's funny 'cause I thought I was your friend.
"Look, our friendship has always been outside the Greek system."
"You always said, you're not gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends."
So let's not lose that.
I see you later.
Hey heavy Poo!
You're here to give the dean his morning foot massage.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen you in the sunlight before noon."
You're getting troubles with the law again?
100 hours of community service.
I consider myself lucky though.
"Could have been a lot worst, I was the only one who got busted."
"And by the way, you're a total dushbag."
Why's that?
Because you raided out our party.
I knew it was someone on the Greek task force
You're the only one I know with personal vendetta.
"Still, pretty low."
even for you.
Now you'll think twice before trying to pouch one of your pledges.
He came to us.
I don't know why I'm bothering explaining myself to you.
Take care.
Bing.
- What did you call me?
- You heard.
"Just to let you know, there will be retribution."
Bring it.
- and I'll never forget...
"- Excuse me, miss?"
Miss?
"- Yes, sir?"
- What's this?
"Three Plantation Dogs, an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,"
"White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams..."
"Okay, you charged us for eight drinks."
There's only five of us.
- Refills are free.
"- Oh, yes, they used to be, but we changed our policy a few years back."
"Well, I wasn't notified."
You should've put that in writing.
"Oh, we did, sir."
"It's on the wall, on the table, and from what I've been told, it's facing you when you use the urinal."
"Well, I didn't come here to read, I came here to eat!"
"Now, take these off of my check, you bunch of chiselers!"
"Oh, oh, oh."
I understand.
"If you're having a difficult time right now, we have an ""indigent can."""
It's near the register.
- I'm no charity case.
"- Oh, of course not, you're a human being."
"But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it."
"Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?"
"Nobody's eating garbage, princess!"
"Now, let me tell you something, lady..."
How dare you insinuate my husband can't pay!
"- Sue, butt out."
- He can pay for this!
- I can?
- Open your wallet.
"I'd be worried about that, George."
"Dr. Ogden looked at it, she says it's healing nicely."
It does hurt like the Devil though.
- Maybe you caught something.
- Something?
!
- Rabies?
"- Henry, she's a girl, not a dog!"
What if she bit a dog before she bit you?
"George, you're not thinking clearly."
"- That's a symptom, you know?"
- Where is he?
!
Huh?
You've no right to keep her!
"She's my property, and I've a lineup of customers waiting."
"Well, then they'll just have to wait."
But thanks for popping in because we've got some questions we'd like to ask you.
- What were you doing in the woods last night?
- Looking for the girl.
Why else?
You were not looking for her; you were hiding her!
"Now, why would I do that, huh?"
Stop playing the innocent.
"You let her out, tied her up, no doubt waiting for the perfect opportunity to go back, get her, and leave town."
Meanwhile the Constabulary and half the neighbourhood are on a wild goose chase looking for her.
"Enough with the lies, Mr. Travis."
What is going on?
You're right.
I was leaving.
I wanted to get her as far away from this town before you bloodthirsty lot strung her up for something she had nothing to do with.
We have evidence that she attacked the victim.
"You know, I find that the most amazing creatures have furry behinds."
"Sitting in Woolsey Nicholls ' office, discussing the furry behinds of bees  Chuck realized this was her very first job interview ever."
"She considered this fact for a moment, then had to ask:"
"I have to ask, are you the Woolsey Nicholls from Bzzzzzzzzz!"
Honey and More?
Mm.
"Yes, I am."
Why are you here?
Isn't Betty's Bees your biggest rival?
I own Betty's Bees now.
We made the acquisition very quietly.
"These days, merger can send brand loyalists into a tizzy."
"Well, I'm a honey loyalist, and you'll get no tizzy from me."
I just hope you're not killing Bee-Girls.
- I beg your pardon?
- The Bee-Girl sales division.
"With any acquisition, there's always downsizing and restructuring."
I hope it doesn't affect the Bee-Girls.
The Bee-Girls will always have a home in my hive.
"Unfortunately, although fortunate for you we've recently had an opening in the Bee-Girl division."
"Oh, yeah, I heard about that."
Kentucky Fitz?
Something about a honey-harvesting tragedy?
Yes.
It's very sad.
She had a bright future here at the new Betty's Bees.
Yeah.
I also heard that she was thinking of leaving Betty's Bees before she died.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
"- Well, you sure hear a lot of things."
- Very gossipy office.
Yes.
- That's always a good sign.
It had to be them.
I know where they are.
"I'll get back to you, Frank."
"Here, show me on the map."
I figured I must have been around here.
But I couldn't understand what Edgar was doing there.
"Then I realised, if he was fighting the weather, and wound up somewhere east of the mountains, about here, he'd have a straight shot over the mountains into Pasco."
He must have took the chance that he had enough gas.
You always take chances like that?
"If not, the mail wouldn't get through."
- This is Capital Peak.
- They must be on this ridge.
"About halfway down the big saddle, there's a clearing in the timber."
What I saw must have been wings.
Get the mail out by train.
He'll take out number eight.
Go as quickly as you can.
You'll have company.
I'm sending everyone up as soon as they refuel.
- He comes through after all.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe our luck is changing.
Jim.
- We could get married.
- What makes you say that?
I cancelled the letters out in our names.
You ever do that?
"You write some boy's last name and then yours underneath, and you cross out the letters that are the same."
"If there are a lot of crosses, you can get married."
A lot of ours do.
"""I'm doing this because"
"I am your daughter"""
and there's this wonderful moment of recognition.
"No, I still can't read it."
It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate.
But this will.
"It's your daughter's name, in the language of the forest."
I know my daughter's name.
"Except, they don't have a word for ""Pond,"""
because the only water in the forest is the river.
"The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her, whatever it takes, and I know that."
It's me.
I'm Melody.
I'm your daughter.
That reveal was another Moffat moment that I got at the exact instant he wanted.
Holy crap.
"This whole time, really?"
The whole time.
"Once you see it, you're like ""of course!"
"Like Melody, Song;"
"Pond, River"""
and you feel like such an idiot.
"It was a good little surprise, there,"
Steven Moffat.
It makes perfect sense now.
Makes perfect sense.
"The Lady Cassandra is the last human, self-described."
"At this point, she doesn't look anything like a human."
"She's had so many plastic surgeries that she's literally just a sheet of skin, with eyes and a mouth and nose holes."
Because she had her chin removed because she said it made her look fat.
She's not unlike women I've met.
I lived in Hollywood for eight years.
"Dad, have you ever asked me what I really wanted to do?"
How dare you talk to my dad like that?
Get up and go to your room.
You are acting as if these people want the worst for you.
Did you see that?
I have just said one word and he has spoiled my dinner.
I'm ashamed of you.
You're vile!
I didn't do anything to make anyone feel ashamed.
"All animals are lions, in fact... all people are animals, isn't that right, sir?"
"Yes, it is."
"Then, if all living things that are lions are animals... animals that are living are lions."
"Then, if p is to q or q is to r..."
All lions are animals.
All tigers are lions.
The bottom line is that all living...
What's important is to be human.
Be a man!
This is what you should always try to learn.
"Dear children, live life as a way of documentary."
How much time do we have till the break?
Damn it!
Kaan.
Come here.
He's going to give the questions again.
You take this and go to the stationery across the street.
How many copies do you need?
Make 40 copies of it.
Tell them to charge it to Professor Rahmi.
I bet that he won't even open it to check the questions.
What do you mean?
The teacher gives him questions and he never looks at them?
Prison?
"Oh, God, don't even say that word."
"Honey, it's okay."
"I know it's going to be okay, really."
How does everything change in a day?
"It's probably just business stuff, you know?"
Cutting corners and inspectors.
Remember Daddy used to bribe inspectors.
He did not.
He left an envelope of $20 bills in the kitchen so they could take it.
He did?
But his kitchen was unbelievably clean.
You have to pay in order to stay in business.
You think that's what Rick did?
How do I know?
"But it's a pretty big project, so who knows how many people might want a piece?"
Don't worry. I hear those white-collar prisons are okay.
They play golf with millionaires.
Municipal waiting rooms can be so dreary.
- l thought you'd left town.
- Why would I do that?
Why haven't you returned my calls?
- To protect the innocent.
- And who does that include?
Whomever you want it to.
"All right, look, do you understand how much I have riding here?"
"My career, my whole life?"
"This is scary. lt's really scary for me, Miles, and I need to ask you, do I have anything to worry about?"
Did you do anything wrong?
"All right, look, the second permit for the high-rise, it was supposed..."
"Shh, shh."
[ classical music playing] lt was supposed to take six weeks.
David.
What's wrong?
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
How?
Why don't you tell me?
What do you mean?
"I told you, I didn't go there."
I know what you told me.
"You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here."
"Yes, and that's the truth."
Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight.
"You know... you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did."
"If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first."
Because remember?
You called me tonight.
"I am here because of you, David."
"What happened, Sherry?"
I went over to the house just to speak to Julia.
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument and... he had a heart attack.
There's going to be an investigation.
You're going to have to tell the truth about this.
The truth isn't going to save either one of us.
"All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes."
"Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months?"
What did you do to Alan?
"Honestly, David,"
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Kim,"
I transferred that feed to your system.
And nocturnal.
And fly.
"Okay, I think we're getting into bat territory again, and I want to steer us away from that."
Like a bat.
"Bats are everywhere, so."
They're really not.
Let's stay on track.
We're just gonna talk about fears about the baby.
What about baby-- baby bats?
"We're not gonna go down the bat thing again this class, okay?"
"Well, as long as it's black, though."
"We're both black, so it's gonna be black."
- A black baby.
- It's gonna be black.
How many of you have even seen a bat?
In real life?
"Okay, there we go."
You can't really get away from bats.
"Let's just keep it on the discussion that we had going, which is: what your worries are about the baby."
"Uh, we're Jewish, but we were afraid that our baby's going to be, like, too Jewish?"
Yeah.
"Like, two sets of dishes Jewish."
"And mark my words, no child of mine is gonna (bleep) through a sheet, okay?"
- Uh...
- My biggest fear... is that our baby will want to participate in SantaCon.
That's where they dress up like Santa?
I-
- I won that.
A couple years ago.
"I have to say yes, fear of a shit baby in this day and age, it's a-- it's a valid concern."
Okay.
"Well, if we're really sharing things,"
"Alright, put in an aircomms request with all the main providers."
I want a name and address as soon as possible.
"If you want my opinion, from the blood on the back of the door the attack looks like it started when she came out of the bathroom."
"Ally, you be the victim."
- Why me?
- Because you're...
"Alright, you be the victim."
"Go on, get in touch with your female side."
She should probably have a leak in the bathroom.
You don't have to do that part.
When she comes out... she gets a blow to the back of her head.
Now it's bad but doesn't kill her.
She goes on the bed.
Now she's probably out cold when the attacker comes at her again.
Are you enjoying this?
"Now, the attacker is covered in blood."
"The traces we found in the bathroom,"
I reckon he took time to wash before making his or her - equally - exit.
Where are you going?
I've just bludgeoned you to death.
Mark!
Happy birthday!
"I was just out for a run, so I, erm, I thought I'd surprise you."
- Right.
"- Life lesson there, isn't here?"
Should never turn up unannounced.
I saw him leave.
So what was Kenton doing here?
Did he stay the night?
"Laura, can you talk to me please?"
Is there any point in lying?
Why would you do that?
"Brah, we don't have a few hours."
"If we don't find this guy by the end of this feed, this girl is as good as dead."
"Yeah, enough with the pressure, man."
And I haven't even smoked my morning bowl yet.
ADDISON:
The truth is
I haven't been honest about who I am and the mistakes that I have made.
And now I'm going to confess.
We're running out of time.
Five years ago in Pl... (playing upbeat song)
What the hell just happened?
She just got played off by Fatso the Keyboard Cat.
Somebody deliberately knocked that feed offline.
And that someone was me.
"Toast, what are you doing?"
I'm getting you your location the only way I know how.
Holm can't reestablish a connection without exposing his location.
It's genius.
And what if he just decides to kill this girl?
What then?
Then I guess I'll look pretty dumb.
This doesn't change anything.
"When that light goes back on, you say exactly what I told you to."
It worked.
He took the bait.
Not so fast.
I still have to zero in on his location.
How long?
"17 seconds, give or take."
ADDISON:
This is my confession.
"Five years ago in Plymouth, Minnesota I was driving my car late at night... when I struck a pedestrian, killing him instantly."
"On the first day of each month, we always did that."
"I've come this far, at least give me some porridge."
You really don't know the etiquette?
Where did your mother go?
"All right, I will find food to eat by myself."
I'm very hungry.
Is there ramen?
What are you doing?
Why are you looking through others belongings?
It's here.
Do you want to eat as well?
Shall I cook for two?
Looks delicious.
This kimchi is like art work!
Don't spill it.
That way the tablecloth must be replaced.
You should have thrown it away earlier.
It's already become like this.
Just buy a new one.
This tablecloth is the only one in the world.
My mother sewed the table cloth to fit the table my father made.
Then ask her to sew another one.
Is collecting red stickers your hobby?
"Here, there, almost everywhere."
Why did you tear it down?
"That... you really don't know, so that's why you ask me?"
"If I knew, why would I ask you?"
You should also know that my dad... has been in the hospital for ten years.
"My mom was there as well, and died because of the accident."
The bank said they would take household appliances.
That's why they stuck it there.
But now I have a job to pay off the debt.
- Who the roses from?
- Amber.
"Damn, those are nice."
Must be her apology for yesterday's behavior.
"Nigga, you sent these to Amber to apologize to her."
She just sent them back.
- I did?
"- Yeah, you had me do it."
"Wait, you don't remember this?"
"Oh, yeah."
"It's still nice, though."
What kind of red is this?
Rose red?
I don't...
"""Are you an enemy of the league?"" What does that even mean?"
"Well, it's a threat, Joe."
"I mean, it's really fucking subtle, but it's still a threat."
"Well, they can't do shit to us."
"Actually, they could ass-fuck us multiple ways, starting with our registration."
"- No, they couldn't."
- They can and they will.
"- Well, that would suck."
- Yep.
"They could also take away that ASM box we have at the Dolphins' game, too."
"- Oh, I love that box."
"- Yeah, so do I."
It's also a matter of credibility.
"The league can go after that, too."
"Let me tell you something, for two guys who didn't start off with a lot of that, we don't have shit to spare."
What's their fucking problem with you anyway?
"It's an old boys' club, Joe, all right?"
"I ain't old enough, I ain't white enough, and I sure as fuck ain't clean enough, and neither are you."
It isn't sex you're afraid of.
"It's love, that's what you can't handle."
"That's what you offer me, with your hands on me?"
"That's one expression, backed up by many things."
I haven't asked for any of them.
Understand what you're saying no to.
"When I take you in my arms, I commit to you, not just physically but all the way."
"That means I intend to worry about you, to take care of you and that's what I want back from you, without any reservations or shame."
- Either you're up to that or not.
- I have my standards and pride.
They're not enough for anyone.
"You need someone to trust, to love."
"No, I don't."
I don't!
"Now, just leave me alone."
I can but I don't want to.
Let me help you.
I don't care if you hang back.
I'll give it time.
I can't.
The offer is always open.
I don't know if you'll take it up but perhaps it'll make you feel better to know it's there.
Hello.
"Yes, Marion."
I don't believe it.
Are you positive?
No.
"No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself."
"Operator, will you please connect me with Evelyn Page?"
I don't believe Norman did what you said.
Two people saw them.
- Marion has spread it all over town.
You've earned the right to see this.
"Hey, there, buddy."
It's me.
"And by ""me,"" I mean you."
"And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot, because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles."
What you discovered about Bracken's partnership with LokSat is too dangerous to pursue.
LokSat?
I knew about LokSat?
I am barely living proof.
I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat's plane was landing tonight.
I barely escaped without being identified.
I am erasing our mind for a reason...
To protect Kate.
"'Cause if she found out, then she will die."
"So do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles, for her sake."
Do you know what this means?
Yes.
You tracked LokSat.
"If we can cross-reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot, then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is."
"No, no."
It means what happened was my fault.
The murders of Beckett's former AG team...
"In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat,"
I inadvertently sentenced them all to death.

"We'll be on our own again, eh?"
"Well, don't forget Mr Nibbles."
Yeah.
Have you seen him this evening?
"No, but his food's gone, so hopefully that was him."
"And I cleaned up a mess in the linen cupboard, hopefully that was him."
"Oh, yes, it's good to be loved."
Good night.
"Morning, Mary."
"I just wanted to say, I hope there's going to be no hard feelings."
In fact I got you a little something just to let you know how much
I value your experience and I'm looking forward to working with you.
Thank you very much.
"I don't drink, but that can go to the cleaners."
"Well, there you go."
I just hope we can move forward and forward our nifty little team.
"Yes, professionalism above all else."
"Jenny, I need you to wee into the cup here."
What?
I just need to check you're not on heroin.
Heroin?
"Yeah, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt but there's been an accusation from a member of staff that you might have been injecting in front of the patients, so..."
"How many miles are you on these days, Len?"
1672.
Just- just outside Kiev.
Kiev?
***
Don't
"- Don't touch the chart, please!"
I'm thinking about getting myself a bike actually.
Oh!
"You know, one of those fold-outs for the commute."
As you should be.
Yay!
"You know, the last time I was invited"
"To a ceremony in my honor, I had to slaughter a chicken."
"Well, at least you've been honored."
"I've-I've never been honored,"
"I did win a contest once at boarding school,"
"And I think there was a plaque,"
But I'm not sure that really counts.
What kind of contest?
It was for drinking hot chocolate
At the winter fair.
"I had a buddy that went to Exeter,"
And the stories he tells would make Keith Richards blush.
"Yeah, well, um..."
I wasn't really into the party scene.
I was there more for the academics.
"It sounds like you've made some great choices, Serena."
I'm glad.
The bad ones have a way of...
Following you.
"You know, I've never heard that hot chocolate story."
"Yeah, well, there are a lot of stories you haven't heard."
"True, but I did hear this one."
"My ex-boyfriend went to boarding school with Serena,"
And he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
At a bed-and-breakfast- Jenny.
Although I'm sure they were just studying.
"You know, like she says, she was all about the academics."
"I have an announcement, everyone."
I've decided I'm moving back in.
"That way, I can be here with you, mom."
You're not the only one who worries about a tsunami.
Why don't you come with us?
"We'll just hike the lower ridge, grab some lunch; it'll be fun."
"Because it'll be just like we're dating, but we're not,so,no."
"I like how you'll take me to your sister's wedding, but you won't go for a hike with me."
"I like how you'll live with me for three years, but you won't marry me."
"Oh,see?"
Hike's ruined.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you guys.
Later.
"Just so you know, when Elliott showed up,I think your mole moved."
"Seriously,it's like twitched a line bit."
Skin Nugget thinks Elliott's the one.
He doesn't want to be the one.
Hey.
"We didn't really get a chance to catch up the other night,so..."
"Is there something that you want from me,Bella?"
"I thought maybe we could grab a drink, but if you're not into it..."
"""Into it""?"
"Yeah,you know what?"
I could be into it.
I could also just... want revenge.
"You know,like,big, classic John Hughes cinematic movie revenge."
But you could also be into it?
See?
Like right there.
"I mean,just for,like,a nanosecond,"
"I'm thinking,wow,she is so adorable"
I want to just die.
And then I just want to throw eggs at you.
I didn't see you.
"You know, an interesting thing happened to me yesterday."
I found a Syrian spy at a restaurant in downtown Miami.
Wow.
"That must be some catch, huh?"
"Actually, it was more like a consolation prize."
I had heard somewhere that your son might be there.
Really?
Well...guess you can't believe everything you hear.
"Let's stop pretending, shall we?"
Next time you see your son -- and we both know there will be a next time -- you tell him I'm coming for him.
"And if you keep helping him, I'm coming for you, too."
So...
How soon can we leave?
"Well, that depends."
"Schmidt, if you can't do this --"
"I can do it, all right?"
Of course I can do it.
But the terms of the arrangement may have changed.
No.
The deal was we get rid of Jabbar in exchange for an all-expenses-paid trip to wherever we want to go.
Your words.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was before I knew that your plan involved
Jabbar stealing everything I have left.
So you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
How much?
Depends on where you want to go.
Depends on how many of you want to go.
"I mean, I-I-I-it's you two, uh, it's black George Clooney, guy with the chin..."
Right -- the four of us.
No.
"It was so Dr. Cicchirini, I do not know..."
"I already am in charge, yes, yes."
I already am in charge.
"Good night, Mr. Benito, where he has gone of party tonight?"
"To where she wants that she goes, lady?"
"That way, with the friendly."
"Ah, I know very well the youth of nowadays."
"Friendly, friendly, small orgy..."
"It hears, by the one of the rent, still I am waiting for the heel of my aunt."
She is really his aunt?
Because the handsome boys always find some arranged to pay by them.
My aunt has 70 years and it pays for the studies to me until the Medicine doctorate ever since a doctor discovered that he suffers 14 diseases and it makes happy giving a pile him of medecines.
I know it.
Already there is it to me counted.
"But although not outside her aunt, would not be anything bad."
Because a true woman knows to give itself and in the bed it is not like the children of nowadays.
I in the bed give everything it.
One is bad?
The belly hurts much to me.
-It wants that it does a massage to him?
-No. no.
"Hungry of love, it was observing to me..."
-Who is?
-I am Italia.
Step inside.
"Professor, is everything to point for the operation."
"Italy, Italia."
"They see this, see here."
Closer.
Professor the operation.
"They see, Italia, Country of saints and poets..."
"Barney, come with me."
Boys!
- Leave him alone.
"- You stay out of this, Michael Coyne!"
We're doing the job for you.
Maybe now the Yanks will leave our women alone.
Get away from him.
"Michael doesn't keep that gun loaded, Mrs. Coyne."
He told me often enough.
"Do you want to test that theory, Michael Hanlon?"
Rose.
Get away from him!
Cowards!
HE COUGHS
"Mr. Coyne, in light of what just happened, the Commanding Officer has placed your bar out of bounds for a period of two months."
Two months?
"He wanted to put it out of bounds, period."
- I had to argue very hard.
- Thank you.
Do you mind?
The Commanding Officer also wanted me to ask if Lieutenant Barnhill gave a good account of himself?
- He did.
- Good.
Good.
"We expect our fellows to give as good as they get, and apparently Lieutenant Barnhill is the current Kentucky golden gloves champion."
"That said, I want to say thank you for stepping in to save him."
"Now, Mrs. Coyne, I think it's more important than ever that we try to understand how to avoid things like last night."
I would very much appreciate the benefit of your local knowledge.
Rose is about as local as Winston Churchill.
But you're right.
She does seem to be able to make better sense of things in this parish than I do.
"I have to go, Captain."
"Just kidding, just kidding."
"The kid is sick, and a child's life will never come back once it's gone."
Child?
Whose child?
His child.
What about his wife?
She's not well and can't work.
Is that why you have to work as a stripper?
I can't understand how he could make you work for his child like that.
It's not for him.
I want to do it.
"People are going on and on about ""freedom"" these days, but I think I should have the freedom to give up my freedom to someone else."
Tomoko?
Good morning.
I was wondering where you were.
told me.
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you.
This is for you.
"Sensei, I can't take that."
"Ah, I hear Pertolucci."
I think Shinako is dancing.
It must be because I was talking about some really unpleasant things last night.
"Sensei, I'm going to dance my last ballet."
What an irritating racket for so early in the morning!
Is Shinako dancing?
"Yes, with Tomoko."
"Did you know that while you're dancing to Pertolucci, this is the anniversary of Nijinsky's death?"
"Yes, he died in a hospital in London last spring."
He went crazy and died.
You could say that he was a victim of the war.
"When he started to lose it, he was talking about ""Russia"" and ""War""."
"Well, Nijinsky was a pacifist, a follower of Tolstoy."
You know why?
"'Cause the one day-- the one goddamn day that your department, that your crew, that your goddamn country needed you the most, you froze up like a goddamn needle-ass little dick."
Anybody else want some?
"You're all right, you're all right."
It's all right.
It's all right.Get up.
I wish you boys could learn to get along.
Jeez.
"When we were riding down in the rig that morning,"
I think we were figuring out what we were gonna do.
"I was ok, so was he."
"Getting off the rig, fine."
"Going in, going up, coming out, the first couple of saves, all good."
Even as the building... was coming down.
"The rumble, all instinct."
"Run, roll, cover, fine."
"But after... rubbed all that shit out of my eyes, out of my ears, couldn't see anything, couldn't hear anything."
"You never told us what to do after, did you?"
"Running up the beach on d-day, huh?"
"Guys on the left of you, the right of you getting their heads blown off."
You kept running up the beach.
Hitler's holy hell.
"We heard all about that, right?"
D-day.
The marching to berlin.
Goddamn concentration camps.
"Going in, freeing everybody up."
We heard all about that.
Goddamn hero.
Goddamn decorated hero.
What were we supposed to do after?
You never told us what you did after.
"Yes, we loved each other so much, do you know why we split up?"
"No need to know reason for split up, there's good feeling in what you said now."
Let it continue.
You must hear why we split up.
Leave it.
"No, please listen to me."
"After hearing whatever you said,"
"I don't know if it's true or false,"
"I liked your character in it, I love you."
He gave a reverse twist.
"You were right sir, a Chennai jeweller made two such pieces, records show it was sold to two people."
Who are they?
What are their details?
"One buyer was our DGP, another buyer was a girl."
Shop has a photo of hers.
Girl?
They don't have other details but have a delivery address.
Go there immediately and find who is she.
He hasn't called even once after going there.
Can't he work here?
Why does he have to go to Malaysia?
"You always criticized when he leftjobs, now he's working sincerely, let him do it."
Is Swathi at home?
Swathi?
Nobody lives here with that name.
This girl.
Who is she?
They give this address only.
"We are living here for the past 7 years, not only here, I've not seen her in this area also."
Why did you say you don't know her?
She rejected my son.
She had promised to be with him always.
I would've expressed my love for you...
Still I'm found at fault...
Is that my mistake?
"When you come after me, I feel angry..."
"When I don't see you around, I go mad about you..."
My heart rages in fire...
Time has no medicine to cure my heart...
"You fight with your conscious everyday, dear..."
What will your arrogance achieve?
Nothing wrong to accept your love...
"Stop fighting, sweetheart..."
Don't you like my arrogance?
"Daddy, I want to talk you urgently."
I'm in an important meeting.
Talk to me later.
No dad.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
They have come there on an official visit.
The clue 'LOSER' was given to me on November 9th.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
"So, he already knew about Ministers programme."
There is some link between their programme  his plan.
What are these Ministers doing in Malaysia?
Ministers are planning something unofficial here.
"Banerjee, we earned 300 crores cheating people  doing all the wrong deeds."
We struggled had to turn this money into dollars.
Your 300 crores is the first investment for the hotels we are going to start.
Big money will change hands.
He has come here to rob that money.
"If he had come here months before, he must've planned it well."
He must've planned a game.
There is a link between Ministers  my uncle.
Wait...not even on Sunday?
Why take Sunday off?
You need money that bad?
"It's not about money, doc."
Let me explain.
The freelance industry is very tough.
"Whatever work comes in, we have to take it."
Or someone else will.
"And if I don't take the job, they won't hire me next month."
My calendar will be empty.
I'll be jobless.
Hire someone to help?
Get help.
Then they will call and give it to that person instead.
And the other thing is when they call they want me to do the job.
So I should be the one doing it.
Do you think your body will stop at just a rash?
It's just getting started.
F*ck you body.
Don't scratch.
Do you have a nickname?
Yoon.
Yoon.
I'm Imm.
"We're around the same age, so let's be friends."
"When I'm treating someone, I take it very seriously."
I think you also take things seriously too.
So we should be able to understand each other.
"Because when I treat someone and that patient doesn't get better, it's like I'm doing a bad job."
You know what I mean?
"You may wonder... why I ask you all kinds of personal questions that seem like none of my business, but... just trust me, I really do care."
Think of this as a partnership.
"If you're helping him in any way, that constitutes a federal crime."
"I'm aware, and I'd like to help you, Ms. Riley."
Anything I can do to get my son through this alive.
"I, uh, wonder if, um, I could ask a favor of you."
I'd like you to sign this.
It affirms that you'll be cooperating fully with our investigation.
"And if you violate this agreement in any way, you're looking at life in prison."
Do you have a pen?
Thank you.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, that's all I need for today."
"And, uh, please -- do call if you hear anything."
Excuse me.
Who are they?
Oh.
Don't mind them.
They're just checking to see if your phone lines are working properly.
"For your protection, of course."
Of course.
Oh.
"We checked the inside of the house, as well."
Just making sure there's no place for anyone to hide.
"Thanks for your time, Mrs. Westen."
"No, no, thank you."
Bitch.
How long is it gonna take for Jabbar's guys to get here?
I-I just -
- I don't understand why I have to be here.
"I mean, can't -- well, what if I wait outside --"
"I already explained this, okay?"
Jabbar's guys need to think that they caught you by surprise while you were working Mike over.
"So, this kid ends up losing."
"And I go to him, and he doesn't pay me."
"Instead, he goes to the Dean, tells the Dean, and the Dean expels me."
When did this happen?
Um...3 weeks ago.
I don't know.
But there's 2 days left in winter break and I can't even go back to school.
And what about the money?
"God, I owe this guy $6,000 now, and next week it's gonna be 7."
"He says if I don't have it by the end of the week, he's gonna come to my house and take it from my mother, so..."
Let's get some lunch.
Bailiff:
All rise.
Judge:
"Having reviewed the petition briefs, and based on arguments presented,"
I hereby deny the petitioner's request for asylum.
"Your honor, may I be heard?"
"You have been heard, Mr. mooney."
There's no legal basis to grant asylum here.
The petitioner shall be returned to her home immediately upon her release from the hospital.
[Gavel bangs]
How long you been out of school?
Ahem.
I got kicked out 2 weeks before winter recess.
What have you been doing?
"Oh, you know."
"Intercepting mail, phone calls."
"Just trying to figure this whole thing out, basically."
"Well, you gotta tell your mom."
[Cell phone rings]
"That's, uh..."
That's the bookie.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.
It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.
We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint, rubber tiles... oh, my God."
Playground turf.
They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.
Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change, and he'll tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
Wait.
"How is it that you caught up with this guy, but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
Surprise me.
We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
And Petty?
He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means, but the turf..."
What color was the paint?
The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
Then he'd be out a career and a girlfriend.
He might have panicked.
"OFFICE OF MAESTRO REINHARDT OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20"
You must excuse me.
I'm very busy.
"I must finish my notes on Verdi's ""Forza del Destino""."
It's my new production for the spring.
"Actually, Mr. Reinhardt, we were hoping to finally speak to an adult."
"Yeah, no offense, but this crew and these musicians... getting high, having sex..."
it's like a frat house on viagra.
Finally.
People who understand what I have to go through every day.
How can I help?
Let's start with the night of the murder.
Did you see Laura during intermission?
"No, I did not."
Can we ask where you were?
We've asked everybody else.
I was right here.
Resting.
"- Okay, well, were you alone?"
"- Yes, I was."
If I'd known I'd be grilled by some Visigoth... / A what?
It's a barbarian tribe that invaded Rome.
I remember that from the one history class I didn't cut.
I'm sure you were a very charming street urchin.
Any other questions?
"Well, did Laura have any enemies in the house?"
"We heard she was very, very ambitious, and you were gonna make her first violin."
She told people that?
I suppose she felt entitled on account of... my friendship with her mother.
Or because she was a prodigy.
I might have questions for you later.
"(Horn Honking, People Chattering)"
"Passports, please."
You came to French Morocco four days ago?
That's right.
"You are a doctor, sir?"
"Yes, I'm a surgeon, a tourist and American citizen."
Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
- l didn't have.
- (Bicycle Bell Ringing)
You were in Paris recently?
"Yes, I was attending a medical convention."
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.
You had an aperitif with him in your hotel room.
You ate at the same restaurant last night.
"Yes, but at different tables."
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him for the first time yesterday on a bus.
"And yet, out of 5,000 people in a great marketplace, he comes to you when he is about to die."
is that the action of a casual acquaintance?
I know absolutely nothing about Louis Bernard.
"Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau."
The
- What's that?
Perhaps you have also never heard of the American fbi?
"Now, wait. I - lt would be so much easier for both of us if you would cease to pretend."
Look here -
The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover.
That's why he was killed.
He told you what he had discovered.
Why?
Because he placed complete confidence in you.
Do you want me to pull it up for you now?
Yeah
I don't think she's going to give them anything.
We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
What can I do?
"Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at."
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years.
Each time only for a couple of days.
Maybe he was meeting somebody.
Cross it with the other suspects in our database.
"Let me know what you come up with, okay?"
Okay.
"Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again."
I already answered that.
"What is it, Edmunds?"
Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.
"Rae, could you pause that?"
She give us anything new on Alvers?
"No, other than the probability she knew him personally."
She's not cooperating.
What are we doing?
Richards is working on her now.
I think that's a mistake.
Why?
"/I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of."
She'll manipulate him.
All Richards does is inflict pain.
There's no way for her to manipulate him.
All right.
"How much more of this you want to endure, Nina?"
How else did I know which hotel you'd be in?
Which amoeba scratching his crutch not a million miles away might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world and tell Lenny you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them, Calum?"
You miserable little snitch.
I got used to having your big cheery smile around.
- Didn't want to see you leave.
- What do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning
- I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"As long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So can you can get us into the house?
I might just be up to it.
Sweet.
Ooh!
That's the front door.
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow, OK?"
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry to disturb you."
- That's all right.
- I've broken down just along the road and wouldn't you know it but the bloody mobile...!
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...
You'll have to tell me where I am.
- Of course.
Come inside.
- Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
"Ok, look, look."
"I'm just gonna leave, all right, Dale?"
As long as I'm here this is not gonna end well.
"Just leave, ok?"
I bet you wanted that to happen didn't you?
"I'm seriously not following you, Hallie."
You really need to calm down.
You put on this little whoa is me act.
But I'm not buying it.
"Just because you throw yourself at every guy that's famous who you think can get you somewhere, and who you think wants you..."
"and then shoots you down, you know what, don't take that out on me, ok?"
You play the victim thing really well.
But it's a load of crap.
Shut up.
"You're not my... friend, Dale."
You're just like every other two-faced girl in L.A.
You just play it better.
"Come on, you guys."
This is retarded.
"What, you're just gonna take her side?"
"I'm not taking anybody's side, ok?"
"Come on, Hallie, let's go."
Don't touch me.
Did that really just happen?
This week on Dirty Roomies...
Would you clean this up.
I can't live like this.
I made the mess.
I don't know why I have to clean it up.
You guys have sex.
We have to do a paper edit on these and get them to run it.
The producers want to see it by Friday.
More light and light it grows!
"More light and light, more dark and dark our woes."
- Madam!
- What is it?
Your mother is soon coming to your chamber.
The day is here.
Be careful and make haste.
I shall be gone.
Your parents cannot know that I have been part of this deceit.
"Farewell, my love."
"One more kiss, and I'll descend."
No.
Come this way.
I'll teach Benvolio to learn your news each day.
"No, more than that."
Each hour in each day.
Each minute in each hour is a day for pining lovers.
And amen to that.
Do you believe we'll ever meet again?
I do not doubt it.
Nor that we shall smile to think of all these troubles in the past.
If God would only free me of foreboding.
"I think I see you, now you are below, as dim and pale as dead men in their tombs."
"So are you dim, love, in dawn's drab light."
Our worries make us pale.
So adieu.
"Oh, fortune, fortune, all men call you fickle because no fortune ever constant be."
"If that is so, then change again, oh, fortune."
Be fickle now and send him back to me.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Please, Benvolio, be a guardian angel to my love."
Watch her firmly and gently as it would do the eye of God.
I can't afford that.
"Afford it you will, Mr. Newman or this court will see that your car is impounded and sold at auction."
"Well, don't you worry, Your Honour."
He's in my custody.
"Well, what do you think?"
I really can't say.
"- No, say."
I want you to say.
"- It's not good, okay?"
It's not good.
You look stupid.
I'm sorry.
You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
I really think this looks pretty good.
"Why not get white shoes, move to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
Maybe you could show me something else.
"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you."
But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
"Oh, hey."
I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.
You make it difficult for your friend to improve his life.
I'm preventing him from becoming one of those guys people snicker at because they look ridiculous.
No offence to you personally.
You people with hair think you're so superior.
You have no idea what it's like.
You ever look in the tub and see a fistful of hair?
Start your day with that!
All right.
Take it easy.
"I'm not taking any time off, I swear."
"Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then."
- It is?
"- Yeah, absolutely."
"In fact, coffee preparation is very important."
Yeah.
"Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb..."
That's great.
"Listen to me, I need to ask you something."
"The other day when I said those things to you about taking time off, I mean, I don't even know"
- if you remember it.
- Like it was yesterday.
"Well, in that case I was just wondering... how bad was I?"
You weren't that bad.
Good.
"Now, would you be willing to swear to that in court?"
- What?
Why?
- No reason.
"Truth is, my recollection is exactly the same as yours."
"You asked for a couple days off, and I gave it to you."
"See, I even wrote it in my diary."
"""Gave Brian two days off."
"Felt good about it."""
It looks like you just wrote that today.
- What makes you say that?
- It has today's date on top.
I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.
Can I go back to work now?
"Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible."
"Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph."
"I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo, my interest was piqued."
No.
They're not funny at all!
"Oh, hello Dick."
- Hello Ben.
I'm waiting for Mary.
I'm sleeping with Mary.
Oh.
Okay.
"So from what I've heard, you're quite the professor funnypants."
"Well, I.."
- It's seems that you have Mary wrapped around your little funny bone.
"But I can assure you, I am a far tougher... bone wrapperer"
I think I'll wait outside.
Make me laugh funny man.
"Well, I'm not a comedian."
"It's just that funny things, just seem to happen to me."
"Oh really, like what?"
"Well, like last week, I was at a bus stop, and it suddenly started raining, pouring."
"And I look over and I see this gorgeous grad student, and she's looking at me, like a kid with braces, looking at a candy apple."
"Mmm, no, not funny."
"Well, I'm about to say hello, when I suddenly realize, that my hair has flipped forward."
"Here I am standing in the rain, with my very own awning."
"Well, finally the bus arrived, and the door opened, the compressor kicked in, and this, this, European weave of mine got sucked right into the bus!"
"Well, there I was, in front of this beautiful girl, and chasing that bus, and chasing my hair.."
"up and down, chasing!"
And I couldn't..
I just.. oh!
Oh!
Oh!
This is not good.
"Yes, Yes, it is!"
The bus stole your hair!
You want to go on pretending to be the brother he's never heard of?
We were getting somewhere.
Then get somewhere honestly.
As his father.
Honesty?
Is that what this is?
"You just want me to make good with my FBI agent son so he doesn't go tell them about it and they come close this little science project, and then bam!"
There goes your cure.
I know you didn't throw yourself off that bridge.
Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard would never walk off that bridge.
Damn straight he wouldn't.
But Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ended up all by himself in a crappy apartment paying for hookers.
Watch it.
And getting visits from his son only when the neighbors complained about the noise and cigarette smoke.
He knows who you are.
Show him who you can be.
I've seen that person.
"I think Duval should see him, too."
You done?
Yes.
You ever think about coaching sports?
That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.
There's only one way back into Duval's life.
He asked me for help once.
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.
"And when he asked for your help, what did you do?"
Gracie:
"Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here."
[Chuckles]
Does my dad know you're here?
"No, he doesn't."
"You know, I'm not a kid."
- Same here.
- So... who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
"No, I wasn't talking about me, actually."
Jonathan here mentioned a woman that he was dating that was very lively?
- Lively.
- Really?
You've got an awfully good grip.
"It's probably kind of handy in bed, isn't it?"
How orgasmic was she?
Thank you about the grip.
"Yeah, I... she was..."
- I don't want to be rude.
- I don't mind talking about sex.
It's what everybody's thinking about anyway.
Why don't we sit down and have a drink and be civilized?
"I'd love to, but we actually were on our way out right now."
So maybe some other time.
"So anyway, hello and goodbye."
Nice to meet you.
That was really weird... the way Antrem wouldn't let go of my hand.
He's a strange and tormented creature.
It really disturbs me that Priscilla loved me once and now loves him.
I'd hate to think what that means.
They're very nice ladies.
"Well, one of them is."
I'd be doing them a huge favor.
I don't feel good about this.
I don't want you to be a sperm donor.
But it's flattering.
They're fans of my work.
I've never had lesbian fans before.
They should go to a sperm bank.
"""Nobody walk around with your shoes off."""
Are you sure?
"When I heard the glass break, I immediately threw on my bathing suit."
Was that for nothing?
Where's the glass?
Yay!
"Get these ""save the dates"" for people's weddings."
You guys know what I'm talking about.
"The ""save the dates."""
When did this start?
Why did this start?
"Why was someone like, ""You know what?"
"In advance of the invitation, let's send our friends a ""save the date,' as to say, ""Psst!"
Heads up.
Invitation on the way.
You're one of the chosen ones.
That's right.
Identical information on both pieces of paper.
"Except on that save the date, you're gonna get a pretty cool, insecure picture of the two of us."
That's a magnet.
Put that on the fridge.
"Decorate your home with our faces.'"""
"You see those pictures, you're like, ""Oh, fuck."
"I can't go to this."""
"They're just looking at you like, ""This is what love is, right?"
"We're in a field in the middle of nowhere, standing next to an abandoned barn."
Come to our wedding.
Look at us.
"We're spooning backwards while standing, laughing about something one of us brought up."
Be at our wedding!
"Look, we're on a dock in the middle of a lake."
We don't even live near a lake.
Medication?
You want to put my daughter on medication because she interrupted your stupid story about a jungle gym on your head?
!
That's it!
I'm taking it off!
Aah!
Ladies!
"Please, stop!"
"Everyone else, there's spinach and artichoke dip in a bread bowl."
There's something about strong women that just gets me going.
"Again, that's my mother and my grandmother."
You're a lucky man.
"Oh, my God."
I cupped your boob.
- Attacked and fondled?
- Didn't fondle.
Aye!
The dip is delicious.
"Hey, Greg."
How are you?
How's your holiday going?
"Normally, I go upstairs and smooth things over, but this time, I can't."
Your mother would assume I was there to bed her.
"Well, I'm not going up there."
She was completely out of line with Anna-Kat.
"I agree the timing was way off, but it really wasn't that terrible."
It's not like Dr. Ellie hasn't suggested medication for Anna-Kat before.
I am not willing to go down that road until we've exhausted all the other roads.
"I totally agree with you, but it's there for us if we feel like she needs it."
"Because the singing in your head, from what we've seen today..."
not effective.
My mom just wants to drug Anna-Kat so she doesn't have to deal with her.
Did you get the make and the model?
"EJ Holden, green with a white roof."

"-Denise, I owe you big."
There's government agents in your room right now.
Somehow they knew we were there.
Any idea how?
-Yes.
"- Alright, We're gonna have to ditch this car and hitch a ride into Albuquerque,"
- What's in Albuquerque?
- A friend.
"Whatever it is you're not telling me, Jaelen, I need to know."
We're running out of time.
-I was compelled by her.
I began experiencing feelings I never had before.
As if I were meant to find her.
I felt myself avoiding better judgment that this was wrong.
A forbidden code of conduct in my task here.
"I allowed it to happen, I wanted it to happen."
Andromedans enforce a very structured mating ritual.
A choice for companion is never our own and never random.
We're conditioned this way from birth.
Therefore there is never the opportunity for...
-Falling in love?
-Yes.
- But did she know the truth about you?
-I didn't have the time.
"But I couldn't stay in one place for to long, so the day approached when I had to tell her."
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
-What do you mean?
-There are people looking for me.
- Who's looking for you?
Do you need any help?
-I'm not from here.
"I'm not from Los Angeles, and I'm not from the United States."
Should I die on the spot?
Is that what you want?
Stop acting like it doesn't hurt at least this moment!
-You have never broken down in front of me.
-How much more do I have to break down?

I can't not think about you even for a sec.
"Right here, half of it."
"No, all of it is like being held by you."
That's only talk.
You always stood two steps away.
Can love have no obsession?
Can love have no desire to possess?
You didn't have such a thing.
Answer me.
"No, I don't."
What were you doing with me?
Were you playing with me?
Why are you doing this?
What do you want to know?
You're being way too cool.
You're ok.
She's miserable.
What happened to her?
She has an inoperable tumor at the base of her brain.
"It's probably been there, according to the doctor, since she was born."
"I guess as she got older, it grew."
We didn't even know it was there until three years ago.
"She's a tough cookie, you know."
"She always to shake it off, take aspirin, say it really didn't her hurt that bad."

She'll never forgive me.

All the house guarantees is you don't go blind.

I can't see you.

Harry.

We might have problems.
"No, we won't."
The road and the film
One thing I often try to do in my films is to keep in mind my first impressions of a new region.
My first meetings with the people of the region.
I try to remember what happened on the day I arrived
in a new village.
How did people react?
How did I see them?
"Familiarity is not a good thing, when you get to know a region, you get used to it."
"I worked there for six months,"
"I knew it like my own back yard, but I had to recapture my first impressions."
The way I saw the people and the way they saw me.
I'll ask.
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Good morning, Madam."
"Good morning, I am honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"Turn left at the fork, it's 200 meters further on."
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The mourning rituals with the traditional self-mutilation of the face only exist in two regions of Iran.
In Lorestan and Kurdistan.
I went to Kurdistan first.
I found this remote village and I started to work.
"I would say, in a film, finding the location is one of the"
most important parts of the Director's job.
The location is as important as the characters in a film.
"Slade, you dragged me into this, yeah?"
And I want things done properly.
This girl has been attacked.
And that to me requires the police.
"Listen, if we call the police then we lose that trust."
And if we lose that trust then we have nothing.
"No police, no."
So what are you gonna about it ?
How did the meeting with Marosi go?
"Yeah, it was wonderful."
"Listen mate, can you get into work?"
I'm still here.
Why ?
OK good.
So I'm gonna send you a photo of a girl.
Have you had a girl reported missing recently looks who like this ?
She's got a really distinctive birth mark below her eye.
What's this about ?
"- I can't tell you that yet, mate."
- Let me just get this straight.
So I'm in the middle of a murder investigation and I'm dead on my feet.
"And you want me to talk to Missing Persons and God knows what, risking my career for God knows why."
And you expect me to do this just because we're friends?
"Yep, pretty much mate, yeah-"
I'll call you if I find anything.
"Hey, any luck tracing the dead woman through the phone networks?"
"Nada, zip, nichts."
"Yeah, a simple ""no"" is fine."
No.
"Is there any news, mate?"
"Yeah, her name is Gemma Morgan."
She's officially a missing person.
"A brilliant bloke like him, too."
"Cutter, we got to do something."
Come here.
- What now?
"- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something."
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
"Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off."
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
"Just a minute, Mac."
This one ain't buried.
"According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open."
"According to Gunga Din, eh?"
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
"MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say."
"You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?"
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right.
Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
"We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind."
"MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument."
"Cutter, I'm warning you."
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it!
"Yes, you heard me."
Of course you won't believe it as you're seeing me here talking nicely.
I can assure you at that time I'd see those news in which..
"A man kills his wife while she sleeps, you know..."
And I could understand them completely.
I surely would've killed her.
We got along pretty well...
Well I congratulate you because for me it was real hell.
Thank God!
Thank God I divorced on time.
"If not, I don't know how could have ended."
"I'm telling you, I had these terrible thoughts... tremendous!"
Did you manage everything patiently?
More or less.
Believe me I'm jealous.
She told me that if I was leaving she'd bring charges for abandonment of the home.
Do what you want!
That she'd get the children custody...
It's alright keep them all!
Look.
In my wrist.
Can you see a little sample of what happened the last day?
She almost break my arm!
She hit me with the iron machine and I thought she broke my arm.
"Actually, she tried to hit me in the head, so I took the iron machine from her and I hit her!"
I left her lying on the floor.
It was all messed up.
We fucked up everything.
I remember wondering if she was dead...
But not at all!
She just got some stitches.
Of course I didn't see her.
Why did Curtis McNeal believe that you know who killed his wife and who kidnapped yours?
I -- even met the man.
It was a dying utterance.
The courts give those weight for a reason.
The man killed himself.
"Obviously, he was unstable."
"All right, your son lied, your daughter ran, and now you're stonewalling me-- if I don't get complete cooperation from your family-- now--"
Sara's going to end up as dead as Amanda McNeil.
Or maybe that doesn't bother you.
"If I knew anything that would help find Sara,"
I'd tell you.
"Plausible deniability might work in Washington, but it's not going to help you in a criminal investigation."
Mom.
I told you not to come.
You want me to leave?
No.
Come here.
Why are you staying here under a different name?
You didn't tell anyone.
No.
I want to know what's going on.
Why is the FBI looking for you?
"Max, Max, sit down."
The FBI probably wants to talk to me because I said some nasty things about your father.
"Well, then just talk to them."
Get it over with.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Sara's missing and Dad's a wreck.
"If you know something, tell me."
"You know, the worst thing about the divorce wasn't losing your father."
It was losing Marcy and you.
Mom...
I feel a lot of pressure Right now.
"I mean, building a legacy For the pomrenkes."
Is what it's all about.
That's why I get out there And work as hard as I do.
That's all that's On my mind right now.
70 miles northwest...
I left my gun on my table.
I love that gun.
We got all the dredging.
That's the more important Than my gun.
"The fighting Kellys Are rolling the dice,"
Going where many believe They'd wind up anyway...
I've never River mined before.
I've wanted to do this For a long time.
Up a river.
I know we're going up against A lot of unknowns today.
And I know that It's gonna be a bitch.
So far this season...
I was wondering If it'd be a possibility.
If I could get My family on your claim.
I just don't think I want to Take a chance on you.
"Due to their Less than stellar reputation,"
The kellys have struggled To gain access to claims.
"Well, I haven't heard Any kind of good."
From anybody on you guys.
"Okay, well, thank you."
And even when they have...
Seriously?
It hasn't lasted long.
We don't have Anywhere else to work.
Could you imagine The old miners.
Having to walk out here Back in the day?
These are photographs of Patton's Allied invasion force in East Anglia.
The Germans think there are only two possible places for an Allied invasion of Europe.
And they're right.
"From East Anglia here to the Pas-de-Calais, or from the south coast of England to the beaches of Normandy."
Operation Overlord has decided on Normandy.
Then what is General Patton's army doing in East Anglia?
There is no army.
These planes are made out of plywood.
We did it to fool the Germans.
The man who took those photographs knows it.
"Consequently, he must also know that we intend to invade Normandy."
"Find him, Godliman."
It could cost us the bloody war.
"Well, sir, if you were at this station and wanted to get out of the country, you could go to Holyhead or Liverpool or Glasgow and then catch a ferry to Ireland."
He wouldn't risk Holyhead because of the passport control.
How about Liverpool to Belfast?
A car across Ireland and a U-boat on the coast.
You're talking about our 11.45 Marylebone to Inverness.
"stopping at Stafford, Crewe, Liverpool..."
Liverpool.
That's where he'll get off.
You're right.
- The 11.45 left on time.
- How do we get on it?
- You could stop the train...
- Yes.
Get us a plane.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Come on, Billy."
"- Fancy a game of poker, mate?"
- Why not?
We're stopping again.
"So, since god planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now,"
why are so many of us hurting and angry inside?
It's because we refuse to believe in god's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only -- so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
"The lord sacrificed his only son for us, paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment."
"Sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
"She's a blessing to us, too."
Paige says you work in travel.
Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
"Yeah, we -- yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips -- see all the good her generous donations are doing.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
There was a meeting between the D.O.D.
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.
"So, Hadji's girlfriend finally came to her senses."
What happened?
She didn't wanna be a fifth wife?
[Laughing]
- Hadji.
- All right.
"Well, it's her loss."
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game... will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life.
Look at us.
We're hanging out with my parents.
"Yeah, about that."
Feel free to get the hell out.
"Well, we can do better than this."
"You guys, we're gonna graduate in two months... and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us."
"We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns."
"Okay, but I tell you this from experience."
"If we're gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan."
"Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight?"
"Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around with their parents... giving them snarky looks."
I remember when the Brady kids got bored... and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
[Chuckles]
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.
Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call..."
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
What say you to Thursday?
"My Lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow."
"Thursday it is, then."
"Come, gentle night."
"Come loving, black-brewed night."
"Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars."
He will make the face of Heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.
My husband.
My wife.
Must you be gone?
It's nowhere near the dawn.
"You heard the nightingale and not a lark, I promise."
She sings each night sitting in yonder tree.
"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn."
No nightingale.
"Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east."
"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
I do not think the light is daylight yet.
I am content if you would have it so.
I have more heart to stay than will to go.
"Come, death, and welcome."
Juliet wills it so.
I will lie with you and say it is not day.
It is.
It is.
Go now.
Begone.
Away!
"Oh, it is the lark that sings so out of tune with horrid discords and unpleasant sharps."
"Oh, hurry now."
"With a bite mark from the victim, I'd fold too."
Here we go.
We don't concede anything at this point.
"My client needs to sleep, gather his thoughts."
We'll talk after the arraignment.
Defendant's ordered to surrender his passport.
Bail is set at $1 million.
Next case.
I hope your client's rested and ready to talk.
Nothing to talk about.
It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do.
I guess the jail house grub made him think twice about getting a plea.
Gloves and a pillbox hat?
Looks like she's going to an afternoon tea.
I'm looking for the elevators.
"Yeah, they're back there."
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?
I don't think Philip's lawyers would want me talking to you.
"Well, did he tell you about the evidence that we have against Mr. Reinhardt?"
The bite on his neck from Laura.
I know about it.
She bit him when he flirted with her in the wardrobe racks.
- He told you this?
- Laura did.
The last time she came to my dressing room.
And why didn't you tell us that?
"At the time, it wasn't important."
Your part-time boyfriend hits on your daughter.
You don't think that's important?
Philip is harmless.
I told Laura she should be flattered.
"And now, if you would excuse me,"
then how about you stay for the night?
"there's a good hot spring near by no, we'll be leaving"
I'll go let's go to hot spring
[Men] don't say you want to go
I said it so what can I do?
uh... how is it with Fujii-san none of your business yes it is
"if, there's nothing now"
I was gonna go for her
please don't take him huh?
Ishida Yuya he's mine

I'm more worried about your future your vast vocabulary?
you don't sound like a kid so I think that there's a plan we can work out plan?
what?
new slogan?
I talked with hirano-san again and
What do you got?
Three people came in and went directly to a cage or table and cashed in $100 chips.
"One of those people, I would definitely call him a person of interest."
You know what I mean?
No.
His name's Ben Hollis.
No record.
But you remember Sean... who got her counterfeit chip from the guy she hooked up with-Alex.
"If you keep tracking Ben, like I did, you get to this."
Ben giving Alex a stack of phony chips.
Interesting coincidence.
Okay.
Find him.
Gift shop.
What about those chip-making machines?
All five machines outside Vegas are accounted for.
"One was recently sold and is in transit from New Jersey to California, but the buyer says he's been checking with the driver every day."
- The truck's currently in Colorado.
- How can you be sure of that?
"I got the driver's number, called him and verified the location of the cell- westbound I-70, just this side of the Eisenhower Tunnel."
"Yes, but cellphone calls can be rerouted."
You get any specs on the rig?
"Yes, upstairs."
All right.
"""Swami, punish Jalandhar before reaching Kailash."""
Let him come here.
He will get the punishment for his sins.
"""Shiv, if you want to escape from war, handover Parvati to me"""
"""Why are you quiet, swami?"
"-Shukracharya, you prayed me..."""
...and got Mritunanjay Mantra.
Is this is your gratefulness?
"Meaning, even if the odds are only 1 in 1,000 that I can get the job done, there's still a chance"
"so yeah, I had defective semen."
"But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."
"Well friends, I believe Chips has just settle the old question:"
Is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?
And the answer is?
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day
six girls?
That's nicely done.
Just putting to good use my large sex organ my brain.
"Thanks for that, Chips."
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.
"You trouble me, Eric,"
taking out your issues with me on James.
Not your finest hour.
He isn't smart enough for you.
How can you still not see it?
"Being smart isn't everything, has it done for you just what you hoped?"
Punishing him makes no sense...
Because he doesn't know about us.
I'm not sure he needs to know.
Especially after the way you behaved today.
"I love him, so leave him alone."
I just couldn't put all the pieces together
Who could?
You.
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you.
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.
I still don't understand how he got in.
I wrote his essay for him.
Did you?
No.
"Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know, in case something popped up."
'Cause she misses us.
PATTON:
Agent Gregorio!
Hey!
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Let's pretend you didn't.
I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.
Good luck!
I thought she hated beignets.
She does.
"So, we got four robberies, all connected to the racing circuit, marked money in Jared's garage."
Neither Russ or Dana are talking.
Hard not to think that they're the bank robbers.
"Yeah, except Dana seemed more scared than guilty."
Check Jared's leave record.
See where he was on each of the robberies.
Copy that.
"Hey, you might want to check, see if any of 'em are cyber geeks."
I dove into the specifics of how they manipulated that car crash.
"Whoever did it, they are good."
I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.
"Yeah, but..."
it wasn't Jared.
"According to the marines, he was TDY on three of the four robberies."
So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.
Maybe he found out about it and tried to do the right thing and got killed before he could.
Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed or why Dana was too scared to talk.
Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?
This time with a warrant.
(keys jingle)
People actually cheered for us.
- How about the Hansons?
"- Yeah, the Hansons."
Killed them.
Didn't see them put one in the net.
"Hey, I looked for you after the game."
What game?
All I saw was a wrestling match.
Got to give people what they want.
"Put butts in seats, win the vote."
Yeah?
"Well, keep playing that way, you won't be seeing this butt in the seats any more."
Interesting style of play.
"Had to let them know we meant business, sir."
That's how it was when I was a boy.
Hard-nosed hockey.
"I admire you, kid."
I do.
"But if all this is about the vote on your home,"
I don't see much hope in hockey changing their minds.
What if I told you we already changed one?
A big one.
"It seems these boys have been inspired by rumours that Mayor David Kenneth plans to support their petition to save the Newman Home when he returns from his vision quest in Peru, if he ever returns at all."
"Man, that's awesome."
I can't believe this!
I want names.
Good newsman never reveals his sources.
There isn't a good newsman within 50 miles of here.
"I'm just trying to capture the spirit of the thing, Bernie."
Is it true?
"Well, no, no, no, no, hang on a tick."
Our office was not contacted for this story and the mayor is unreachable.
From our Gyula's life there is a word.
Do not make a fuss already.
- Okay
Did you send him in into his house?
- Yes.
- Wrong.
I said that it is not allowed to be in consideration of me.
This pine smell.
This ozone.
"You do not know it, what this means to me."
"After the a on frontline service filled of 9 monthly,in intolerable noise and smelliness,"
"I cannot to say it, how much I am glad about your kind invitation."
"Well yet we, how we are glad."
"Terrific to thought to it, that what you may suffer there on the front."
My Gyula. my son.
It is not necessary to be worried about his.
"I take it beside myself as soon as the cold season begins, into the flag office heated well."
Kind major lord.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
- How we say thank you for this the for major lord?
How we gratitude?
Thankfully i owe for the kind hospitality.
"Because I was like that already, than the chased game."
Be calm.
The your Gyula son's will be your good place beside me.
He loved that little limping child the best.
Himself bought it because of that always beside it.
Was not clever though.
He said it.
Onto your kind Gyula son's health.
- Thank you very much.
"- Thank you very much, major lord."
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
But you told Chloe.
Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby.
She's a good friend.
Excuse me.
Chase?
You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I'm just as confused as you are."
But all I know is that I love you.
"And I'm falling in love with Angela, too."
And I need to make this work.
Go on.
What's happening with Nina in interrogation?
They're getting something.
What?
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought.
"You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol."
Tony knows what he's doing.
"Okay, fine."
"Look, I need to get together with Chloe."
I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation.
Not yet.
"Ryan, look, you're wasting my time."
"Now, I humored you with the physical."
"And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here.
She wants to talk to you.
"- Well, this is not the time."
"- Actually, it is."
"You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.
That's why I was deluged with all those letters.
"- Bea, now look..."
"- Oh, I know."
But if I ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill...
"Oh, don't you see how much more worried that would make me?"
It all amounts to this.
"February is a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen..."
"If you don't stop looking at me like that, I won't be responsible for what happens."
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
"- Oh, here you are."
"Sir Charles, glad to see you."
Sorry you weren't in.
You look fine.
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.
"Sorry to be late, my dear."
In an argument at the club.
What's on the program?
"I thought we'd go to Stewart's, if that's agreeable."
Excellent!
"But, while it's on my mind, Harry there's something we must straighten out."
I've gone through enough with Beatrix over this.
"I may be getting old and crotchety, but I won't put up with it anymore."
I'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible.
"Oh, Father!"
"Well, Sir Charles, that's..."
"Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:"
"Wedding at St. Margaret's, Bishop Manners, reception."
"Every single hair gone, one by one, from worrying-- worrying about getting you passes, worrying about protecting your rights."
"And now, for the first time in ten years, when he's got a chance to prove to his old buddies that he's a success, a master sergeant, he can't go to that reunion."
Why?
Because his own platoon is too cheap to raise a few meas...
"Corporal Henshaw, do not beg them."
Let them search their own soul.
"Just remember him with this head of hair, gone from worrying."
'Cause he's the kind of a sergeant that worries about his men day and night.
All we're asking is a measly few bucks.
"-Now, look, come on now."
-Come on...
-You got a couple of bucks.
-I tell you no!
I can't spare another truck!
But I need another truck.
This is an emergency.
Call the Automobile Club.
Very funny.
The garbage is piling up behind my kitchens.
What am I going to do?
Learn to cook;
you won't have so much garbage.
Why don't you turn blue?
"Oh, knock it off."
Hey...
"Well, this is a gay little sorority meeting."
Mother Bilko's little chickens got nothing to do?
"Hey, Sowici, hold it."
You may have some extra guys for KP any minute now.
"Now, listen, you meatheads..."
"Ernie, Ernie, I was just giving 'em tomorrow's work detail."
Work detail?
It took 1 0 days.
I didn't ask questions.
Should I have?
"You know, I was once a boy scout myself."
We brought concrete from Indiana.
I don't remember a sales tax.
"Was there one, or was it made to dematerialize?"
How come the union allowed us to use 50 mechanics when their contract stipulated 1 00 on a job this size?
Why would I know any of this?
Wasn't all this your job?
I didn't make these things happen.
Somebody else did.
I've tried not to ask who.
- So you don't know?
- What are you saying to me?
A lawyer once told me you can't be convicted of perjury for something you didn't say.
What are you talking about perjury?
What is going on?
I have to tell the truth about what I know.
And so you shall.
And that's it?
"You have nothing more to say, nothing to warn me about, nothing to help me to know what to expect?"
"They really could have come up with a more attractive plaza to represent our city, don't you think?"
Rick.
"Where you're standing right now used to be a mountain range, and before that, an ocean."
Keep that in mind.
All things pass away.
[sighs]
- What are you doing here?
"- Hey, Dad."
- You're supposed to be in school.
- l ditched.
"You should feel great, ma'am."
"That was a solid, important defeat."
"I'm gonna go change my clothes... croak to the nation, and then I'm going back to bed."
This is good.
Moyes is threatening to go to the floor for an official investigation into what happened today.
- This is bad.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in the middle of this.
"Does this mean I'm implicated, too?"
You know what.
Just say no even if it does.
"Well, Gary, you said you were important."
I can testify to that.
"Ben, this is one of those little hiccups that you said was not gonna happen, so I'm gonna leave this in your capable hands."
"Mike, you have to deny this like you've never denied anything before."
So lie?
The one thing I've been trying not to do?
"Look, I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself."
"And while that isn't true, find some comfort in it."
"- Okay, Gary?"
- Nope.
"I will work on putting forward a new, streamlined"
Families First Bill before Congress in the near future.
She sounds like an underwater Bob Dylan.
It is actually quite difficult to understand what she's saying.
Children from impending climate Armageddon.
Which may be a good thing.
And God bless America.
And we're out.
"Thank you, ma'am."
Okay... oh.
"Okay, thank you very much, guys."
Fuckin' figure it out.
Better not forget those fuckin' all-dressed chips.
No ketchup chips neither.
WAYNE:
Figure it out.
Somebody really ought to write a letter.
"They do got six different types of Cap'n Crunch, though."
How do you know that?
Saw a comedian talks about it on the Juste Pour Rires.
"Can't remember his name, though."
"Good guy, though?"
A little long-winded for my taste.
"But, yeah, a pretty good guy."
"Well, glad to hear he's a good guy at least."
They have running water down there?
"Anyhoo, the evening went so well that, uh, we got up to a little bits of a foolin' around."
Did you French her?
WAYNE:
"Kind of out of line there, Dary."
- Did you go up her shirt?
"- Now you're really out of line, Dary."
"We did French, that much I will reveal."
"Well, you already revealed that much, might as well just tell us if you went up her shirt."
"It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dary."
"I don't like to kiss and tell, but..."
"The Frenchin's tooks a hard left turn, from which I have yets to recover."
Do you wanna know what?
"I'm not asking you to kiss and tell, 'cause that's impolite."
But...
I'm kind of curious.
"Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell."
I'm sure you boys have had a couple  of curve balls thrown your way betwixt the sheets.
with seeing that side...
And then if something we cant forsee happens on those 2 shows... we still have portland 'alright' in reserve just in case.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"well what I was going to do, I was going to cover most of those songs before march of the pigs"
I was gonna coming up doing like an acoustic thing...
A middle aged more gentle approach...
to this industrial chaos.
I'm touched by that.
God thinks he's all that and a bag of chips...
That was my street theory... you know that... (?

Comes to the fucking nap.
That's something I made in (?
") 1968, I was thinking (?"
) would rule.
- Is that the year it was written?
- Yeah.
I was one.
Somebody shove it up in front of me.
just trying to put that into perspective too much fucking perspective.
you kids are such agists
"Yeah, I know, I know..."
I think it'll be all right...
see you later!
"I... hurt myself today, to see if i still feel."
"I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real."
"The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting, try to kill it all away, but i remember everything."
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"So, there are 100 possible combinations."
It is really hard to guess.
But Kaan has an amazing idea...
"When the day for stealing comes, we'll arrange for Gamze to be the guard on duty."
"When Professor Fatma is in our class, you'll make your move."
I can't.
I get panic attacks.
"You will not panic, sweetheart, you will only attack."
"Professor, there is an urgent phone call for you that you have to take."
- Really?
Who could it be?
"- I don't know, professor."
I am coming right away.
Don't make any noise.
"When Professor Fatma leaves the class, I'll go next to the table and pretend to be looking at the attendance sheet."
The bag will most probably be open...
I'll get the password without anyone noticing.
- They have hung up the phone.
- I don't know professor.
Sure you don't.
When one day they come to ask for your hand... how are you to start a family and raise kids?
So irresponsible!
How are we going to get the questions from the bag?
I am answering.
A) During lunch break.
"Meaning, while there is no one in the school or the teachers' room."
Kaan and I have been watching her for the last few days.
She never goes out with that bag.
She always leaves it at school.
Meaning in the cupboard of her room.
Congratulations!
Correct answer.
Because I didn't think anybody would be here!
I thought that Jabbar and his men would be trying -- trying to kill me!
"Look, I have millions invested in here!"
I was just trying to salvage something!
"I thought they were gone, and then a couple of guys came back."
How many?
How many guys?
Three?
Five?
I don't know!
Just get down here!
"That doesn't sound good, Sam."
I know.
"When planning an escape, patience is key."
"Someone without training might jump at the first chance to strike, but that's exactly the wrong time, because that's when your enemy's most alert."
"In fact, the best time to make your move is after you've let plenty of other opportunities go by."
The other advantage of patience is it gives you a chance to find out if the situation has changed.
What happened?
"We were on our way to his house, and my -- my men called."
He snuck into his warehouse.
"He was hiding in his office, crying like a woman."
We got the pig.
Now you'll get to see him bleed.
I been waiting for so long.
It's been 10 months since you helped my whore of a wife run away from me.
10 months.
Now I think...
My waiting is done.
"Look, I-I don't -"
"- I don't know where she is, okay?"
That's a lie.
"No, l-listen, okay?"
All right.
"So why did Cleveland drop the ""a"" from its name?"
"Well, the masthead for the newspaper?"
Mm-hmm?
"They figured out that it was, like, not long enough..."
"Well, we're not bffs yet, but he did promise to text me at least once a week."
"Thank you, joy."
"Oh, hey, how did the foundation fundraiser go?"
Utterly exhausting.
But it'll be worth it just to see the smile on my face... when I win that emmy.
"And, of course, announce my miraculous recovery."
Yes.
You know what?
"You know, I feel like I really did a good thing."
"You know, which gives one a certain glow, a little something extra."
I'll say.
I notice even now a few people looking my way.
"In fact, quite a few people, like..."
"I'm still wearing the goiter, aren't I?"
"Oh, I bet it feels good to get rid of that thing, doesn't it?"
"Oh, it really does."
I was talking to the goiter.

We know the hiding place of Mickey.
It is an hour that we feel the stench.
"Understand, understand."
"Excuse me now, first and after."
I did not know how to reach you.
"Before the fuse burning, you were gone."
I remember.
I tried.
"LeBaron has found hanging in your window and thanks to a photo of your cousin on ""him"", take him to the apartment in the face that I had to empty."
"- It's the most, have not understood anything!"
- And Mickey?
You have done?
I destroy everything I love.
"We repeat, chin."
"Watch the Venini, it's not destroyed at all."
"Indeed, you know that was a lover of my mother?"
He discovered that the love had no money for this animal.
He was a thug that proved that he did not have the means to offer what he thought it could throw away.
"And now, no longer, does not want more, do not know."
"Thank you, I do."
Here is the soup my first Venini mistreated.

Love makes miracles.
"And I thought, ""Well, this won't go well, I probably shouldn't."""
"But I thought, ""Well, what would my mother say?"""
LAUGHTER
"I thought, ""Well, she'd say, 'Yes'"", so I said, ""Yes"", and I snorted this not overgenerous line, and I realised, as soon as I'd done this,"
"that this wasn't cocaine, as we know it."
"It was burning at the back of my nose, and I said to this man, ""What was that?"""
"He said, ""Oh, it's crystal meth,"""
and crystal meth...

LAUGHTER
"I mean, it makes you very, shall we say, uninhibited."
And I realised I'd been groomed by this man.
"He'd sent his friend along, cos then he was able to approach me."
They were working in tandem?
I was more receptive.
And I went off with this man...
and I'll just jump ahead three days.
LAUGHTER
Please don't.
"No, you don't want to know."
"Oh, we do."
I came too in a multistorey car park in Harlem.
"Oh, what bad luck, Julian."
"Well, there's a..."
You know...
LAUGHTER
"You go to a club, have some drugs with someone you've never met before and then all hell breaks loose."
It wasn't what I was expecting.
Were you in a car?
"I was near, shall we say, an open boot."
Were you?
"But, there's a sequel to this."
"You know, I got this one Pseudochromis a pain in the ass fish of all time."
"If I move a piece of coral two inches, he won't eat, he don't socialize."

- This fish aggravates me so much--
- What's the point?
The point is that someone has to ask themself:
"""Is the fish worth it?"" That's what it comes down to."
"Is it worth the aggravation, his pain in the ass ways?"
You're not a fish.
"You are a person, and you can talk."
I should have expressed myself better.
I should have said:
"""It makes me nervous, you giving me something."""
"And,""I'll get used to it, though."""
"And,""Thank you very much."""
How am I communicating?
Good.
- Who did you go up there with?
- Just some friends.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Yeah.
You asked about Greg today.
- His marriage has problems?
"- Yes, he was asking what it was like to be separated."
"If I was glad, did I do the right thing?"
- What did you say?
- That it was tough.
"That I was unhappy, but if I got a shot at something again I might be able to do something with it."
I've learned a lot too.
"And I know what you mean, feeling like you'd take better advantage if you had another chance."
"Johnny, I'm seeing someone."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Let's go home together.
I have a friend waiting downstairs.
Welcome back Father!
"Well, hello there."
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
But I came to greet you.
How did you know I was going to be here?
"Well, you said in the letter that you'd be coming back on the train with someone from the museum, so I thought you'd be here."
That's pretty smart.
I have some business to attend to.
It won't take long.
Would you like to come along?
We could get something to eat.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
No.
I'm going to meet someone from a textbook publisher.
They want to use something I wrote for a Japanese textbook.
"Keep your elbow up, but keep this shoulder down."
"Father, Numata is really annoying."
Why?
Because he hangs around mother.
Because he's her manager.
"If he says something he shouldn't to mother or Shinako,"
I'm going to challenge him to a duel.
A duel?
That's pretty extreme.
The ruins of our family's old house are overgrown with weeds.
"Mother and Shinako are thinking of putting a dance studio here, right?"
"Yeah, but not if they don't have the money."
"By the way, when I was in Kyoto,"
I saw a camera magazine with Shinako's portrait in it.
Takehara probably took that picture.
"This is Captain Malaparte, our liason with the Italians."
We'll see...
"I hope to be useful to your mission, Coronel Wyatt."
General Cork has briefed me.
"General Cork has directed Captain Malaparte... to help you, Mrs. Wyatt."
"Obviously, you'll have to cooperate with the population... and Malaparte will be very useful."
He has a fabulous villa in Capri.
So what do you do in peace time?
I was far too young to remember.
"He was in Spain before that, and before that, Ethiopia."
He should have gone to the US.
Our Italians are pretty well off.
"You're right, but there were already enough organ players."
"Are you making fun of me, Captain?"
"No, on the contrary, I admire your assurance."
You're everything we're not.
You think so?
Get away from me.
I said leave me alone.
- Don't touch me.
- Keep away!
"- Come on, let's go, come on!"
"- Out, come on, let's go!"

No thanks.

Yes.
"Yes, indeed."
"Well, why don't you get dressed and join us outside?"
"Sorry for the, uh, the strip search."

Time to see the merchandise.
It's about a 5-minute walk.
"Uh, watch out for snakes..."
And each other.
Radar detected a speedboat leaving the ship last night.
"Guys, if bosley's been taken off-board, he could be anywhere."
It's a big ocean out there.
"Charlie, we're hoping you can narrow things down for us."
"Luckily, I can."
I had my contact target the search to a few key nearby islands.
Most of them are owned by the requisite movie stars and corporate titans.
This one is the odd man out.
It belongs to Carlton Finch.
"With a name like that, he's got to be bad news."
"I'll give you a lift, whereever you're going."
"Tell your fucking Minister,"
I clean up this city all by myself.
That I defend the law in spite of the laws.
Raising the rats against each other.
It's an art rarely appreciated.
Are you going to get me my medal?
I'll tell everything!
I can't go further on.
Candy?
Don't swallow the pit.
one last detail you've missed.
Mary...
I tracked her down less than a year ago.
I'm her father.
"Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Libya!"
"Albania, Egypt, Nicaragua: ""War."""
"""I often have this strange and penetrating dream of an unknown woman..."
"""Whom I love and who loves me..."""
"""Do not spoil this tender act of being or being not."
"""For I have lived up to our pact, awaiting heart is all I've got."""
"""Wisen up, Pain, and hold still."
"""Were you demanding the night?"
"It's coming down, at will."""
"""Black air, envelops the city, bring peace to some, and to some the pity."""
He's been in there for hours with that bitch of his.
Do you want to unbind him?
"He keeps the door closed, and says nothing."
"Try to shake him up, for fuck's sake, or we'll miss the big barbeque in the white city."
You are the only one.
And you didn't do anything.
"Léo, it's the Prince of Idiots."
Mr.Smith. Mr.Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see, you, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war."
"""The War""? ""The War""?"
Damn bloody war.
The war has skimmed off the cream and we are left with the rancid curse.
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Millibar Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
No.
We rather tried to keep this under wraps at present.
"It seems that there's someone in this disdain department, who knows there's someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk."
That their engine broke down before they even were out of British waters.
Pity.
Pity all around really.
Your first draft bore it so well.
"Actually, the Starking sisters lied."
What difference does it really make?
God sake!
Of course it makes a difference!
It's not the truth!
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man, who terrified them and... set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
They never got there!
Because their engine failed!
Now that's a truth we won't be telling.
Moral sapping apparently.
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
"We are saying, this is based on a true story."
We don't!
For Christ above man!
You are supposed to be a propagandist.
[ Gasps ] Or when we broke into Tom's house and we locked his girlfriend in the closet?
Wow.
We sound totally insane when you string 'em all together.
You ready for another crazy adventure?
"The crazier, the better!"
- [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ]
"So, like, normally, this is the moment where I would pound my drink and then smash it against the wall, but I'm kind of at a loss here."
- Would these help?
- [ Gasps ]
Soul mates!
"Party in the bathroom stall, y'all!"
Oh!
Isn't it great that you can still get crazy when you're a mom?
It's time to put the popular girls in their place.
"Hey, catty cheerleaders, you want some real gossip?"
Your jock boyfriends are all in love with each other.
"Ellie, I am trying to focus on my job."
"Me, too."
You think this dumb prom's gonna mock itself?
Prom is not dumb!
It's a beautiful night of magic and wonder.
"And sometimes, a poor kid's life is destroyed forever."
But that won't happen here.
"Oh, no!"
Not on my watch!
It sounds like you're working through some stuff.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
And I gotta get back to my thang.
"Hey, bet you 5 bucks that 5 years from now, that condom will still be in your pocket."
You get it.
He's not gonna ever use it.
It's not that heavy.
"If New Christine and I get married, and you and Jeff get married, you'll be my mother-in-law."
"No, I won't."
The fourth grade class will now sing a song to those important people in our lives we call grandparents.
"Hey, Christine, what do you have when mother-in-law's up to her neck in concrete?"
Not enough concrete.
Funny.
"It was funny 20 minutes ago, and it's funny now."
"# You're a grand old man, # # you're a generous man #"
# And we love how you # # give to our school #
# With your silver hair #
"# You were there last year, # # when we needed an Olympic pool #"
# Should auld # # acquaintance you forget #
# Just remember # # we need your check!
#
"Did you enjoy the singing, Mother Campbell?"
You still got it.
I got another one:
What do you have when your mother-in-law is up to her neck in quicksand?
I hate you?
Close.
Sand that's not quick enough.
"Oh, hey, I got one."
What did the mother-in-law do to thejackass?
What?
Ow!
"Don't pay attention to him, Christine."
What the hell is wrong with you now?
I'm just so happy.
"I love my dad so much, and I've always respected you."
"And now that you're together, it's just so great."
"You know, I never had a very close relationship with my mother."
We hardly ever talked.
"Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?"
Yesterday at breakfast.
He was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
He wanted to open his own wrestling school.
So he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
But they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
Looks like yr husband was quite a successful coach.
"Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?"
No.
Vince was a great guy.
Everyone admired him.
Did he owe anybody money?
Or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
"I'm sorry... but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are."
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Please, give us a call us if you remember anything else."
There was one thing.
"I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof."
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
Looked like two people.
I heard them talking.
Creeping around.
It was kind of scary.
What time was this?
Around 4:00.
I knocked ony neighbor's door.
He said he would go up and check.
And?
"He said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people."
How long's my lunch hour?
An hour.
"Meanwhile, Jay really had arranged some great work experience for Simon, freezing his arse off at a disgusting plant-hire yard."
This is shit.
I don't wanna do this for a living.
"Nah, it's all right!"
"We'll be able to drive the diggers soon, I reckon."
Jay?
Why have you stopped?
"This is work experience, not standing-around-being-a-useless-twat experience."
You don't need any experience at that - you're the expert!
"Sorry, Dad, we only stopped for a moment."
This is well knackering.
"You'd better get used to it, cos with your brains you'll be fucking lucky to get a job throwing shit into a skip!"
This isn't exactly how you described it.
"Get many Valentine's cards, Simon?"
- Just the one.
- One more than Jay's ever got.
- I got plenty.
"- Don't worry, there's a girl out there for you."
You just need to find a desperate bird that likes the smell of BO and blokes with tiny cocks!
"Now get back to work,"
I ain't paying you to sit on your scrawny arse.
Nice.
- All right?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you should be at work?
- They let me go home at lunch.
You jammy bastard.
"Si, what's all this I hear about you having a fight with Danny Moore?"
What?
!
That's my business.
But you...
I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.
"Well, I'm trying to fight a war."
I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
"Anything for the cause, Major."
"Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five cylons."
Maybe the face of God himself.
"... the five lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light..."
Scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple.
Only to the chosen one.
The chosen one.
The chosen one.
The five await me.
"Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth."
What truth ?
Caprica.
I'd like to think that we three have shared something.
Transcended the barriers that separate people.
"And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in."
"Well, that's not the case at all."
Is it ?
"Because we three, we're integral."
We're part of...
We're finished.
"Baltar's and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica."
The five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple.
We have to go down to the planet.
"Only you and I, can see this through."
What are you after ?
What is this secret that you keep pursuing ?
You have to tell me the truth.
"Who is this ""someone"" to whom a citizen can ""go"""
that isn't so far up the cop's ass you need a digging crew to find them?
"There's only one person,"
And he's got the best investigators in the state.
The footage disappeared while you were looking at it?
Who has the access to do that?
Only the police.
And the shooting?
"Besides me, only the police knew where DeBray was headed."
"You're leveling quite an accusation, Laura."
That's not the worst part.
The jewelry from DeBray's apartment never made it to lockup.
It's gone.
"Well, DeBray is dead."
What does somebody gain from stealing that evidence?
I don't know.
"But whatever these people are trying to hide, the man who shot Haskell DeBray is out there."
"Tom, if you nail the dirty cop and get him to talk, you can catch the killer before he kills someone else."
"Then I'm gonna have to nail him, aren't I?"
"It goes without saying this stays in this room, right?"
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Good.
Good.
"Okay, Janet?"
"Serena, how about we take you home, little lady, and we have taco night at the ranch?"
- I make the guacamole.
- Deal.
"Captain Nico, you come, too."
"Sorry, Serena."
Captain Nico's got to catch a couple more bad guys before I can have a taco.
"Janet, can you have them bring up my car?"
- Hey.
"- Hey, Madam Senator."
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
I wish you'd heard the speech.
That line you gave me about...
"""If we can put a man on the moon, then why can't we put all men on the moon?"""
It was perfect.
It really broke the ice.
"- Great audience for that, huh?"
"- Yeah, it was great."
What's goin' on?
"Uh... well, it looks like Runyon or somebody close to him... has been running a little private investigation... looking for stuff that the Feds wouldn't even touch."
"- It's, um..."
- Yeah?
What is it?
What...
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- You're asking me to step down?
I'm asking you to do what's in the best interest of the party... and this president.
"Well, I'm sorry."
"I can't do it, not over this."
He's not going to allow me or himself... to get shot down over what would've been a private sexual encounter.
"- Some swan song for the old man, huh?"
- It's fuckin' awful.
The senator got a little wild when she was 19.
What is the big deal?
Let me explain the big deal to you.
The people of this nation can stomach quite a bit.
But one thing they can't stomach is the image of a vice president with a mouthful of cock.
You don't have to use...
Look.
"If they know me and I go to school with her, then she... I don't know who she goes to school with, I don't go there."
"You talk the most, but you haven't shown us anything yet."
Then I'll show you...
Those kinds of dances didn't exist when I was young.
What is this dance called?
- Are you going to start now?
"- No, we're finishing."
"Don't they teach you the polka, only those modern ones?"
"They do, but there's no room there for such things."
You can't dance the polka?
Where do you dance?
"The polka is almost like skipping around, and where can you... lt's a kind of rhythmical skipping to a polka..."
Don't you know some tune?
The polka melody's like this... lt'll survive three generations.
"I'll tell you about one polka you know, it's gone round the world."
You of all people know it!
"Wait, wait!"
I'll show you.
Roll out the Barrel.
That's it!
It held the whole world together throughout the war.
"That's music, the real thing."
Let's try it!
"Mummy, play one of those... I'm already playing."
"Better something else, the tango, for example."
Better the tango.
I'll show you how it should be danced.
"Slowly, just hold me."
We'll just move our bodies like...
people in love.
In love?
She's eighteen!
We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
"So, enjoy!"
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested by the military police.
"Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket."
He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
"But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't."
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels for 50 years.
It's in their blood.
"I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties."
We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels.
"Sit down, Michael."
Sit down.
"If I could only live to see it, to be there with you."
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
"Here we are, protected."
"Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI."
"90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government."
90 miles.
It's nothing.
Any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
Then why don't you just relax?
"Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good."
?
"Think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her... to touch her."
"Josh, eww."
What?
He needs an emotional trigger.
The other thing I need is silence.
Good idea.
"Lori, out!"
What did I do?
This is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
She could have stayed.
"Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it."
"Listen, Kyle,"
I get how messed up you are right now.
"If anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again,"
"I'd be a mess, too."
But you've got to pull it together.
You really think I can do this?
Knowing how much you care about Amanda?
Zero doubts.
Come on.
"Deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time."
"By focusing,"
"I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road."
"In this case, the road led into the Trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer."
"Through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system."
Maybe she still won't go out with you.
"Oh, god this is a fucking disaster."
"No actually, it's OK, it's fine."
- I can move away and change schools.
- My night hasn't been brilliant either.
"At least next week will be better, get my teeth into some journalism."
"Oh, yeah, the paper want to keep me on so there's no room for ya."
Tell me you're joking?
They said I was the best work experience they'd ever had.
This is an urgent message for William MacKenzie.
Please make his way to the front entrance as his mother is here to pick him and his friends up.
This is an urgent message for William MacKenzie.
Please come to the front where your mother is waiting to collect you.
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
It had been a strange week.
"I hadn't experienced much actual work, but I had learnt some valuable lessons."
Never work with children or animals.
Don't call your valentine a porn star.
You're a nasty little virgin.
"And despite what I'd thought, a girl touching your penis is not always a good thing."

I love martinis.
They heal all wounds.
After about 1000 of them I'm still amazed.
But your poor liver has had to work so hard.
"I know, I know."
- I'm very proud of her.
- Your liver's female?
Away from all the problems of the world.
I think I might have brought my problems with me.
Away you go then.
It's just that I want to write something.
"Well, then write it!"
About Trina.
"Ah, right."
"A life must be worth a few well chosen words more than just ""Body found in car."""
"Yeah, but there are so many rumours flying around now."
You can't even see the ducks from the trees.
I think you might find the expression is 'wood from the trees'.
It doesn't even make any sense.
Trees are made of wood.
"Yeah, yeah that's the point."
"Nah, I still don't get it."
"But anyway, back to your problem."
"Which is essentially that if I, if I write only the bare facts,"
I feel like I would have done her and injustice.
"Yeah, but on the other hand you don't want to upset anyone and you know, go into messy, gory details."
"No, I don't want to do that."
I was out here the other morning and right before my eyes
I saw two dolphins mating.
It was beautiful.
Beautiful!
But also a bit disturbing.
"Yeah, I can imagine."
"And when they get, you know, quite passionate, they actually bite each other's fins."
Quite badly.
It can scar them for life.
Is that what happened?
"Nah, nah, nah, a killer whale appeared and chased them off."
And me.
You still itching for more?
Some guys never learn.
Here's some ice off the roof.
"Beat it, you little stooge."
"Go on, tell the crumb where he stands."
I called a meeting of the barracks chiefs this morning.
I thought I could get you transferred into another barracks.
But it turns out that nobody likes you any more than we do.
"So you're stuck with me, huh?"
Maybe the Russian broads would take him.
"Not with that kisser, not anymore."
"You got off lucky last night, Sefton."
One more move and you'll wake up with your throat cut.
"You listening, Sefton?"
"Yeah, I still got one good ear."
"Now, you listen to me."
There are two guys in this barracks that know I didn't do it.
Me and the guy that did do it.
And it could be any one of you.
"You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price or the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey."
"And he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick."
If there's gonna be any throats cut in this barrack--
"Out, out!"
Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!
"As you were, gentlemen."
Please.
Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses 75 men.
"Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally."
Naturally.
It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
"As for the blankets, you will notice they're very warm."
"We use standard fiberglass insulation, cdx subfloor."
You see something?
"Well,yeah,your joist,24 inches on center."
I wod have built them on 16.
Then you wouldn't make a profit.
That joist there look discolored to you?
Could be mold.
Mold spreads from the bottom up.
"Need a black.On it,boss."
We'll be there soon.
"Boss,abby ran the prepaid phone rd we found in finn's pocket."
Had only one call in it.
"It was to a self-storage company in dale city,virgia."
Good.Call the storage...
I did.
how ****I was just taking a breath.
I called the self-storage place.
"Finn paid for the un in cash, only signed in once, so I figured that ziva and i should probably get down therand check it out."
Sorry abouthe breath.
Kind of reminds me of pacific heights.
Don't tell me.
"-A movie -yeah,interesting plot."
Yuppie couple buys their dream house then the tenant from hell tries to destroy it.
Michael keaton's best work.
Looks like organic material.
Would a two by six match finns head injury?
Ducky thinks the blunt object hit his temple.
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.
Which would have landed him nose-first in th insulation.
Get a sample of this wood back to abby.
"Oh,my god!"
"Bob,why are you letting them destroy our property?"
You know what she said?
"She said, ""Vijay are you cross with me?"
"I said, come on, why would I be angy with you?"
"Why do you think like this, Meena?"
"She said, ""Vijay, why do you always remain far from me?"
"""You never even give me a look"""
"And then when I gave her a look, do you know what I saw, Sheetal?"
I saw mo large drops oftears in her large eyes.
That moment I realised that this girl loves me from within her heart.
She considers me to be her god.
I said...
"Meena don't, I can't bear to see tears in your eyes."
For my sake wipe it.
Please!
Excuse me.
This isn't your Meena's arm.
"You won't be doing the Lindy overnight... but with proper care, that leg will be 1 00%."
Why is there a bandage on my hand?
What's wrong with it?
"When you consider that boys come through here every day... and lose their sight, limbs, even their lives--"
What happened to my hand?
"Well, you have some nerve and tendon damage."
"Fortunately, there will be only slightly diminished use of three fingers."
- They'll look perfectly normal.
"- What do you mean, ""slightly diminished""?"
There will be a certain loss of dexterity.
- For how long?
- Afraid it'll be permanent.
"- Oh, my God."
- But your leg will be fine--
I don't care about my leg.
- Damn it.
I still haven't finished what I was saying.
President Choi's daughter has caused her father some trouble.
Her character is different from others.
"Yesterday, two female guards handed in their letter of resignation."
"The reason I came here is to protect the President, not the President's daughter."
"Hey, newcomer!"
Are you in charge here?
Do you think you can do whatever you want?
It's not that.
It's just that my dream is...
Stop talking about dreams!
Protecting the President's family is as important as protecting the President himself.
The training has been postponed to next year and it will be absolved by new employees.
"It's six months of training, and I will be the trainer."
Repeat after me.
One.
"You are entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
One.
"I'm entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
Second.
My function is to be a protective shield.
Second.
My function is to be a... protective shield.
Lee Yun Seong.

Lee Yun Seong!
"I texted you several times, to ask for your bank account, but you didn't even reply once."
I said you don't need to.
That amount is just like the price of chewing gum for me.
"That's all you want to say, right?"
Wait...
"I don't know if I can chew that much gum, but please let me try to repay you, okay?"
She said she saw them from the skylight.
"Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here."
"Yup, here we go."
This is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
Boom.
"So get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools."
And there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
Nelson was lying to his wife.
He also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
Maybe he had something going on the side?
"Confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements--"
- I want to know what else he was hiding.
- Done.
What are you working on?
The blood we found on Nelson's roof.
"I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human."
Take a look.
"Cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal."
It's a very large animal with claws and scales.
"The blood comes from an alligator, Mac."
Mr. Potato Head.
The live versision.
More like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato head as a boy.
I would time myself.
See how long it took to assemble him.
Some would say I was obsessed.
"You, obsessed?"
No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
Looks like some ki of jewelry.
It's an acupressure magnet.
Who?
Who paid you?
Stop!
You're hurting me.
Who paid you?
Marzio.
Marzio!
Marzio Catalano?
The castle guard?
He's the one who cut the balcony palings.
I saw him leaving Don Francesco's room with a saw in his hand.
"I didn't understand what he was doing at the time... but when the lord died, he gave me some money..."
A lot.
So I wouldn't talk.
"Then, at the trial, he gave me some more."
"I didn't want to hurt Beatrice, or you... but I was afraid."
There was nothing else I could do;
he threatened me.
But who gave him the money?
Marzio doesn't have a penny.
That I do not know.
Ask him yourself.
"Having examined all the evidence... the court of Rome finds Beatrice Cenci guilty of the murder... of her father, Don."
"Francesco Cenci, Roman patrician, and decrees that she must pay for this unnatural crime with the death penalty."
"In light of her age, and as a sign of clemency... punishment by quartering, which is expected for patricide... has been commuted to a less painful death by decapitation."
There were two of them.
They shot me.
Then it was Giacomo.
He ordered you to cut the balcony palings.
He gave you the money to bribe Martina.
- He's a rogue.
"I've always been a faithful servant, and I would never betray him."
She must be really pretty?
Who does she look like?
She doesn't really look like anyone.
Hmm...
What kind of person is she?
- Hmmm.
Like a fairy?
- Fairy?
"Ah, no, well."
"Calling her a fairy is a bit of an exaggeration, but, like she's out of reach?"
"After meeting her, I thought nothing else would do for me."
Many things happened before reaching this point.
Hmm..
"But, you know."
"Confessing one week before Christmas, and instantly ""Ok""."
"That girl broke up with her boyfriend right before that, right?"
"Well, yes."
"Since she became alone just before the event, it feels like she just went along with it for the time being."
Are you fine with that?
"If you put it like that, I have my selfish calculations too."
I told her then because I knew about her situation.
I see.
I know about it all.
But it's okay.
"Anyway, because Saeko-san is my girlfriend now."
You've become really good at tempering.
You don't even need a thermometer.
- I can just tell by how the texture feels.
"Its heaviness changes according to its temperature, right?"
"Alright, right now its 28 degrees."
"Ever since I was a kid, I vaguely thought I would probably continue with the family cake shop, it wasn't something I took seriously."
I found how I wanted to shape my life after meeting Saeko-san.
There were nights
I remember them
I will carry them till the end of my days
On the way
Between Deganiya and Kinneret
Stood the loaded cart of my life
He came up to me and said:
"Listen to me, little one"
I built a house for you
In the evening you'll embroider a shirt for me
By day I will drive your cart
What's wrong?
I had a dream about Zeltzer.
Who's Zeltzer?
"Zeltzer, the lighting guy."
He worked for years in the theater.
I wonder if he still works there.
I dreamt that Zeltzer turned the spotlight on my pants.
And I insist that I want it only on my shoes.
And he insists that the audience won't be able to see it.
"And I repeat: ""Only the shoes, not the pants."""
He gets mad and says that no one will see the shoes.
"So I pull him off the ladder and go up there myself, turn the light only on his shoes, but he walks away, leaving me alone."
Suddenly I see Mommy walking on the chairs.
Floating.
Then she comes up to me and lifts me in the air.
"""Direct me, direct me."""
I tell her that first I want to turn the spotlight on her shoes.
"She stands under the ladder,"
I turn the spotlight and she says:
"""Will you direct me?"
"""Will you direct me?"""
Her son was on the football team.
Good for him.
I'm not sure if it's good.
Okay.
Have you been drinking?
At work?
Of course not.
"Although, since my day has been extremely trying,"
I am gonna have a drink now.
"Yeah, well, my day has been no picnic, either, so... how about I join you?"
Sure.
Just completely infuriating how some people are... so...
Treacherous?
It's like one of-- one of our investors.
"He's-- he's one of those people that's like a-- like a virus, the kind that mutates, metastasizes into a cancer."
"Yeah, how do you get rid of people you want to get rid of?"
You redouble your efforts.
Why don't we ever do this?
What?
Drink together.
Because I'm always standing here and you're always in the kitchen.
"No, I mean-- I don't mean like that."
I mean-- why don't we ever talk?
- Aside from every day?
"- No, I mean--"
I mean really talked or... make love.
"Libby, we-- we've been married a very long time."
"Yes, we have."
God knows I'm not talking about fireworks.
"But if you were dying and you had one final moment to... look back at your whole life, at the things that mattered the most to you... what would you say about our marriage?"
"Well, we tried our best."
Both of us.
"This dose was much stronger, so expect to feel worse tomorrow."
Thanks for coming.
How's things?
very busy.
So let's stick to the real reason why you asked me here.
You said it was important.
I need you to loan me your share of the estate.
"I'll repay you in two years, with interest."
"I need you to help me, Nik."
Help you what?
Sort out your debts or have you found another sure-fire investment that can't lose?
I made a bad mistake with the cars.
I was tempted and I succumbed.
It was a mistake.
I admit it.
But I am tying to right that error.
Can't you see that?
I need you to believe me on this.
That requires faith that I just don't have.
There isn't anyone else I can ask.
What do you want me to do?
"I need you to just sign the papers from the solicitor, approving the release of your share of the will."
I see.
"You've made all the arrangements already, have you?"
I will pay you back.
"I'd really appreciate it, Nik."
I'll think about it.
Do you have to go so soon?
"Yeah, I've got a lot to do."
You're more interested in dead people than the living!
At least the dead don't lie.
We'd like to take a sample of your DNA.
"First of all,his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted proctor to suffer the most.
Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim,it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to tony torrell's wife.
- How you doing?
- Uh...
I'm fine.
"Uh,i'm here to see agent rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
"If someone were following me right now,"
"Do you really think they could stop me from, say, uh,"
Breaking your neck?
"If I didn't care about getting caught, that is, and..."
I don't.
"Look, I get it."
"You and the people you work with,"
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
You'll be watching pretty little jenny
And you'll be watching pretty little me.
So maybe it'll be her.
Maybe it'll be someone else.
The important thing is is that devalos knows
About all this ahead of time.
"That way, if he doesn't step up,"
The girl I find...
Yeah.
Quick there and back.
No leftovers-
- I will be there to cut the turkey.
"I know, I know."
There's my cab.
Love you.
I'll just be another minute.
"...in Fairfax, not much better, and along the coast, our coldest temperatures, as we will dip down into the teens."
"The forecast of scattered showers in some areas was quickly turned into the wet, icy accumulation that we are seeing out there right now."
"So, let's go ahead and take a look at our local temperatures."
"Now, in DC, we can expect lows into the 20s."
"In Fairfax, not much better, and along the coast, our coldest temperatures, as we will dip down into the teens."
"This could let up at any time, but for the moment, we can expect one rough Thanksgiving weekend ahead."

Tell me about it.
"Yesterday you were calling this a ""chance of rain."""
Is he here yet?
Is he here yet?
Did I miss him?
"I just hung up with him, Abbs-- he's getting on the elevator."
One very fast elevator.
Hey.
"Ellie, he's adorable."
"Aw, thanks."
"Jake Malloy, this is the amazing Abby."
- Oh.
"Uh, I-I could've guessed."
Just let me assure you that I am informed of everything you do
"It was Corbett, wasn't it?"
"Now, don't try and change the subject, Merle."
I would like an explanation.
What exactly did you think you were doing?
- Eloping.
- Ha ha ha.
"Well, we'll forget all that romantic nonsense for now."
But your Mr. Danny Pierce can consider himself fortunate if I don't have him arrested.
How did you know his na--
Why can't I get married?
Because you are still a child.
I'm nearly 21.
"I wasn't referring to birthdays, Merle."
"Some girls are ready for marriage at that age, but others, like yourself--"
Well... what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid that you should never get married.
You're--
You're just not well enough.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
But it's better to face it now.
There will always be unscrupulous men after your money.
No.
Not Danny.
I'm afraid so.
"I'm having him investigated, and I'm sure we will find he's nothing but a cheap fortune hunter."
That's not true.
You're lying.
Now that's enough of that kind of talk out of you.
You'll go to your room immediately.
"For punishment, you wanted to wear Grandmother's diamonds to the party."
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
I don't care.
"Unfortunately, no such tunnels exist, but don't worry, we have plenty of other exciting sights to show you guys."
Follow me this way.
"Now, does anyone wanna guess how old the White House is?"
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.
That's very accurate.
Construction began in 1792 on what was then called the President's House.
"Now, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution set forth that a district of no more than 1O miles square should house the new seat of government."
Does anyone know why?
So no one state could claim the President's House.
Right again.
"You're a real keener, aren't you?"
"Now, the founders were crafty..."
"Hey, so you can tell me the truth."
Do you get picked on a lot in school?
"No, I don't."
- It's a gift certificate for a massage.
- I could use one.
"Martin, it's-"
- It's been...
"I know, for me too, Ted."
You know you're gonna miss this.
- When's the last time you took a day off?
"- Oh, I'm fine."
I'm fine.

"He told me to, he told me you were leaving after 20 years of police service."
What sort of way is this to break this kind of news to someone?
"I know, it's shit, man."
HE LAUGHS
Are you taking the piss?
Have you just...?
Because it's his first day.
First day?
Taking the piss?
"Flipping heck, mate, you had, right, so, so it's a joke then, is that it?"
No.
Isn't it?
"Still sacked, I'm afraid, Sid,"
I just thought I'd let Dermot hit the ground running.
What?
Her body was found the day before your dad died.
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
ls there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
- Not that I can think of.
- Miss Lau has answered your questions.
- I'd like to draw this to a close.
"- You're right, Miss Lau."
I did know your father and you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't the son of man that scares easily but someone had him on the run.
"- If you say so, Harry."
- Yet you...
You seem completely unaffected through all of this.
Cool as a cucumber.
Why is that?
I don't like the direction you're taking.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
- If you're not charging my client...
"- What did they promise you, Lily-Anne?"
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)
Why don't we toast something interesting?
Like what?
Like Geronimo there.
He's interesting.
In a pig's ass.
Don't you read the papers?
"They put Geronimo in jail, where he belongs."
"Let me ask you something, Tex."
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?
Geronimo's a man so great... that Corbett there'd have to stand on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.
Frank.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Do you have a gun, Tom?"
"- No, I don't."
- Good.
Then you're gonna get exactly what you deserve.
I don't know where you come from... but the manners that you arrived with are just awful.
I'm trying to imagine how you could make such a reference... to the mother of the future heavyweight champion of the world.
You ain't champion yet.
"Besides, you're acting like an asshole."
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
"- Now, wait a minute."
"Before we start this fight, I wanna ask you one question."
- Is it about my mother?
- No.
I've said enough about her.
"If I win this fight, am I the champion of the world?"
You're not big enough.
Then what are you picking on a little fellow like me for?
"You get in a fight in a public bar, they'll discredit you from your profession."
I'm gonna save you from that.

"[Newscaster] In Washington, the size ofthe crowds... have swelled to overa quarter ofa million demonstrators... protesting the ongoing war in Vietnam."
"There must be a quarter million ofthem out there, Edgar."
"You know, they've been at it nowfor a whole year."
"Young kids, just like Tricia."
I don't know.
"Do you think they gota point, Edgar?"
This whole damn system of government.
"Rememberwhat Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President,"
"""The powerwas lying in the streets, waiting for someone to pick it up."""
The Communists have never been closerthan they are now.
Now's the time to get back to the old themes.
The ones that made you president.
Letthe Communists know you're onto them.
Those bastards.
Think they can ruin Tricia's wedding... by dancing naked in the reflecting pool.
"Well, don't listen to them and don'tquit."
"Remember, Kennedy and King were against the war."
Where are they now?
[Chuckles]
Howthe hell the Times gota hold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace.
Yeah.
"You know, we can't keep a damn secret in this government."
They're stealing papers rightoutofthis office.
"Johnson had the same damn problem, till he bugged his own office."
We took thatsystem out.
"Well, her arms and legs seem to function all right."
"Well, then there's no brain damage or muscle paralysis."
"Well, Dad, I don't know about brain damage."
Something's happened to Judy.
"Paula, you sure you're not imagining things?"
"Dad, I swear to you, I am not imagining anything."
And I think Judy's suffering from amnesia.
"Now, what can I do?"
"All right, Paula, I'll tell you what to do."
Take Judy back to the clinic and do a complete diagnostic work-up on her.
"Take her pulse, blood pressure, uh, respiration readings."
"Do an EKG, an EEG, and you can X-ray both arms and legs."
"And if she's still out of sorts you can give her a mild sedative, ok?"
"Marsh, is all that really necessary?"
"Oh, no, of course not."
I just want to keep her occupied.
"Uh, Paula, you sound as if you're having kind of a bad case of nerves."
"Dad, my nerves are perfectly calm."
"Now, there's something wrong with Judy."
She's a different chimp.
"Honey, she probably just wants some attention."
She's not faking.
She is sick.
She's very sick.
"All right, honey."
All right.
"Take Judy back to the clinic, and do as I told you."
Are you sure you feel up to it?
"Yes, Dad, I'll do anything to help her."
- Anything.
"- Ok, honey."
Paula and her instant diagnosis.
"A street prophet, if you will."
I got to change microphones.
- What?
- I gotta fix the mike.
It'll just take a second.
I gotta get that...
Back off!
"Back off, will you!"
That's dangerous!
"Get-Get down, you stupid little nothing!"
- What is this?
- What?
I don't believe this.
"This is Frank Smuntz, Channel 12 San Diego Evening News... riding in the thick of the police high-speed chase."
"As you can see, Channel 12 is the first newscast to get a close-up look... into the face of this runaway horror."
"If we're lucky, we're hoping to get a visual conformation on the condition of the hostage."
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss!
Can you give us a thumbs-up if you're okay?
"- Right here, pal."
- Can we show that on TV?
"Uh, Frank?"
Frank?
"Um, it appears we've lost our feed there from Frank Smuntz... riding right alongside that speeding BMW."
- Lolly.
"- Thanks, Steve."
I think before we continue we should take a moment to apologize to our viewers... for that obscene gesture you just saw coming from the window of that speeding car.
Yes.
"That's the risk we take with live TV, isn't it, Lolly?"
That's right.
We'll be back with more live coverage... of Kidnapped At 100 Miles Per Hour... after these messages.
"Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends."
"Well, then why were you staring?"
It was hard to miss.
"Trust me, Salvadore is the least of our problems."
It's freezing in here.
Why would they make a room like this?
You should have seen my masseuse.
She was so hot.
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.
Why do you think I wanted to get a full release?
You know what?
I don't even want to get into this with you.
Into what?
I don't want to get into this conversation with you.
Why is that?
"Because I don't want to be put in a position where l,d have to lie."
Why are you getting all high and mighty on me?
"No, I'm not so high and mighty."
"Joey, I'm not judging you,"
I'm just not asking anything because
I don't want...
I don't want to know.
"Because that way, if someone asks me..."
You won't have to rat me out.
I would never rat you out.
Of course I wouldn't't rat you out.
"Right, right."
"But this way, I don't have to make that decision because I really don't know."
"All right, let me ask you something, then."
"Could you honestly say that after seven years together, that you get turned on by the same woman?"
I do.
Without going to the highlight reel.
You're playing a verbal shell game.
"Yeah, and who are they to say we can't carve out our slice of the American dream, huh?"
I'm a capitalist.
I don't kowtow to threats.
Fuck the evil empire.
They can't stop me from retiring at 40.
"Uh, you're past 40, Joe."
That's why they can't stop me.
( phone ringing )
( clears throat ) Joe Krutel.
"For a little guy, you've got some big balls."
"Hey, good to hear from you again."
How's the family vacay going?
None of your business.
What is your business is Vernon.
"And apparently, you didn't take care of business very well."
"- I'm sorry, come again?"
- I didn't come a first time.
You said you had Vernon under control.
Do you know he converted his endorsement money into ownership in a grow house?
Ownership?
"That's something I know something about, Joe."
"Uh, I have no idea why they think that would be okay."
It's totally unacceptable.
"I appreciate your concurrence, Joe."
Tell your client I'm cutting him.
"Boys, knock it off!"
( gasps )
Hey.
( clears throat )
I'm gonna share something with you and I hope you will be as supportive of me as I've been of you this morning.
Kisan Teague has the kind of talent that can take our offense over the top and finally turn the negativity around.
- I'm listening.
We'll come and get you when we're done.
It's Jesse.
Just-- just please try to be careful.
Some of this stuff is really valuable.
Yeah?
Hope it's bulletproof.
"Come on, Schmidt."
Open up.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Bad news, Sam."
"When I was picking up rounds, I paid a neighborhood kid to ride his bike by Maddy's house, just to make sure everything was okay."
He said the garden rake's propped up against the garage.
She gave the meeting signal?
Why'd she give the meeting signal?
"I don't know, Sam."
It's a rake.
It didn't come with subtitles.
"If you think someone might be following you, the temptation is to drive erratically."
"It may force the tail to reveal itself, but it also reveals you're onto them."
A better approach is to drive very conservatively.
Go below the speed limit and linger at stop signs.
"You won't win any fans on the road, but it'll help you lose your tail."
"If they think you're simply an overcautious driver, it'll catch them off guard when you suddenly take a risk."
"Oh, thank -- thank God."
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
"Well, we, uh..."
we've been busy.
We got the signal late.
Yeah.
That's the problem with communicating by garden tools.
What's going on?
Olivia Riley paid me a visit.
Are you kidding?
"And waste a chance to know something they don't, something this huge?"
"I'm the best thing that could happen to your mission, 'cause I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know about Earth."
Can you teach me how to make my human stop yelling?
Dani?
I don't think anyone can do that.
"I'm Cody, by the way."
- I'm Blades.
- Boulder.
Classified...
- That's Chase.
- And I'm Heatwave.
"So, Cody, now that you know what we are, name one good reason why we shouldn't leave this planet right now."
These tunnels like this one all over the island.
And they all end in the bunker.
Great for sneaking out of the firehouse.
Wow.
That's like a million optics set in carbon.
- So beautiful.
"- I guess, it kinda is."
So why would you ever wanna leave?
This is what everyone would expect you to act like.
See?
"Lock your legs, stick out your arms..."
You try.
Really?
"I don't know where you learned that, but no."
"Look, Cody, I understand what you're doing, but what I don't understand is how ""talking-like-this"""
has gonna make my rider long respect me.
The trick with Kade is to make him think he is in charge.
"Trust me, I've been doing it for years."
Is that part of the film?
"Running works, okay?"
"I learned at a very early age, you don't try to be the hero."
"Okay, I ran from bullies, I ran from cops,"
I ran from feelings.
"Okay, I have very good survival instincts."
"If it wasn't for those, I would have been moshed to death at the warped tour."
"Okay, survival instincts, yeah, all right."
What are you supposed to do when there's a tornado coming?
Run.
Where?
Away.
"No, you're supposed to go into the basement."
Wha... go to the basement?
Where the laundry is?
"What am I, gonna do a load of whites?"
"All right, well what about if there's an earthquake?"
Run.
"Again, with the running."
"You know, it's times like this where you really see someone's true colors."
Is that a song?
"No, it's a real emotion, Whitney, all right?"
"You know that we're in a relationship, right?"
"We're supposed to be together, we're supposed to be a team."
"Yes, we're on a team."
"It's called ""team stay alive."""
"Okay, teammate, can you tell me one situation where your first thought wouldn't be to run?"
I guess if I had a bomb strapped to me.
Thatwhen you'd stay with me?
"Come on, man, let it out."
What you feeling?
"Mark, I don't..."
"Dude, for the last time, don't tell me, tell her."
"You're going to need money for rent, for living expenses."
"I can help you now, if you want."
Ten quid.
What are you saying?
I was just going through the role of the MOMT in your adjustment to life after prison.
"Nice meeting you, Lindsay."
"We both have such busy schedules,"
I don't think the taxpayer will mind.
Shame I'm going to ruin the evening.
"Right, well, you know you can speak freely."
I can't tell you how to run your department but I want you to move Steve Arnott on.
Make him some other department's problem.
Let me tell you about Steve Arnott.
"He's my most dogged investigator, he will not leave a stone unturned."
I had intended that meeting in a more social setting would make this less confrontational between us.
"Yeah, well... .. we've only just got started."
I would like the chicken liver pate and the sea bass.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
And I'll have the soup followed by the sirloin steak.
Medium well.
And... no sauce.
What's the matter?
I'm a married man.
Separated.
I took vows.
I can't undo them.
"Don't you want to stay with me, Ted?"
"I'm sorry, Gill."
I'm sorry.
I don't need to watch this if you want to put something else on.
It's fine.
- But -
"Yeah, but we've had this conversation."
Yes?
Mmm.
Why aren't you having any?
There's only enough bacon for one.
You have it.
"Hands and knees, Pat."
I'm waiting.
I'm begging you to help me.
"After you gave David the all-clear, he went down the recruitment office to find out about signing up."
"When the time comes, they'll give him a medical and if they find anything relating to asthma, they won't take him."
Tell them he's got it.
David is a young man -
- He's not a young man!
He's a boy!
A 16-year-old child.
I understand how you must be feeling.
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.
All I'm asking is you write to the recruitment office and tell them that David has a history of chronic asthma.
"But, Miriam, he doesn't."
"It's acute at best and has, thankfully, been on the wane for a number of years."
They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!
"With all due respect, Erica, this is between me and Dr Campbell."
Will has looked after your family for many years.
"He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice."
He can't possibly do that.
I sympathise.
I really do.
But you'll do nothing.
And this isn't the first time.
"If she doesn't get regular treatment, she will attempt suicide again."
"And Hong Jin-chul has many problems, such as his lungs and kidney."
It's a miracle that he's even still alive.
He calls himself a doctor?
- Damn it.
- What?
Recruit circus performers?
How about setting up a funeral home?
We're all being punished by God because you all have no faith.
"I always asked you to go to church, but you all never listened to me."
No need for it all!
It's over!
What can we do with dying people?
They need to be alive at least if we're going to eat them or not.
The game's over if they die beforehand.
Since when have you gotten so smart?
"You got it all down, don't you?"
I'm not as dumb as you think.
I thought you were a complete bonehead.
I'm glad that you realize I'm not.
"Anyway, I could die earlier than I expected because of you all."
Living a 1000 years is enough.
"What, you bastard?"
How dare you talk back to me.
Stop it please!
There's still 15 days left.
It's not late to find more.
How can we look again in these circumstances?
We're even murder suspects.
"Yeah, I told you not to come down."
You said something right for once.
We can't wait any longer.
It's time we take back what is ours!
It's time to take back our city!
"Say ""Nuktuk."""
"There they are, folks, the sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple,"
Bolin and ginger.
Let me get a picture.
"Wow, that was fun."
And did you hear what Shiro said?
We're Republic City's most famous couple.
"Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend."
We are not a couple.
That's not what Shiro said.
Stop stuffing your moustaches with varri-cakes and get to your post!
"You got it, boss."
You two are the pinnacle of refinement.
"This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier, folks."
"President Raiko and the first lady, buttercup Raiko, just arrived."
"And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire,"
Varrick.
"There they are, my two most honored guests."
Mwah!
What do you think?
No expense has been spared.
I brought in the finest entertainers from ba sing se and the best food from around the world.
"Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the fire nation."
They make the best red stuff over there.
In fact...
"all right, picture time!"
"Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
I wanted to.
"Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste."
I specifically remembered making sure that he had a cot.
"I think he made that up, I think he wanted the attention."
"He totally did, he's such a drama queen."
"- He was a trouper, though."
- I don't know how he did that...
"I think it really hurt him to sit and stuff so when he's sitting in the van, you know..."
But he never really complained.
"But look at the energy, just..."
"I mean, when I'm in agony, I don't do stuff like that, normally."
"When I'm in agony, I make sure everybody knows that I'm in agony."
Absolutely.
Rule number one.
"- Hey, I'm in agony."
- Sympathy.
- put on some pants.
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
"- Ari, we are adorable."
"- Shut up, there we are."
This is still all reshoot stuff.
- All reshoots.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Did you guys have to revisit anything to get back into character six months later?
- No.
- All me and Kat had to do is look deep into each other's eyes and then we were back.
All we had to do was...
"There's some creepy old men teachers, like, going in and out of the hallways."
"Remember, when we were waiting to go outside?"
That was all we needed.
"- Alexis, in that outfit, is so adorable."
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried,right?"
"- Silver stars,Korean war?"
"- Yeah,yeah."
"Look,forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah,and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from,Warden."
"Glad you approve,son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
**********
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills,Mr.Petty.Those are mints."
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle,the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
"No, thanks."
"I had a raisin earlier and, boy, am I stuffed."
"Sabrina, you're looking awfully skinny."
"You're not still on that diet, are you?"
Me?
"No, I'm fine."
"Hey, do I see a little scalp up there?"
(gasps)
(gasps)
Don't tell me.
I've inherited the Spellman gene for a keister the size of Manhattan.
"Oh, I knew it."
It was just some sort of spell.
And yet the insecurity about my butt won't go away.
I think it's time to bring back suspenders.
"Sabrina, we have to talk."
"Oh, well, I only have a little while before Harvey picks me up for the dance and your stern lectures tend to eat up the clock."
"Not only are these things a scam, but they can cause serious side effects."
But I have to lose weight.
Like making you think you have to lose weight.
"Come here, look in the mirror."
"No, not the mirror!"
It's so cruel and unforgiving!
Not anymore.
"That creepy salesman put a spell on it, but I deactivated it."
See?
What are you talking about?
It's like looking at a picture of William Howard Taft.
"Oh, no."
All this dieting has affected you psychologically.
"You can't see that you're so thin, you're practically sick."
"Oh, well, what good is my health if I'm not Queen?"
It's just busy.
"Los Angeles in January, San Francisco..."
"Powell's in Portland, the whole West Coast thing, really."
I'm told to expect big things out there.
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.
And you're doing a really hurtful job of sounding unfazed.
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.
"You're not interested in this or me, not even a little."
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.
- And you don't now.
"- Well, good for you."
"No, not good for me."
Great for me.
"You know, you told me many times, now that I think about it, actually, that my goals were unreasonable and foolhardy."
Am I recalling this correctly?
"That my dream, the only dream I've had since I was 14 years old, to write and publish a novel of my own, wasn't something I could just reach out and have."
"Hard work, you tell me."
"Years of working up from the bottom, you tell me."
"Well, you know something?"
You were wrong.
"Dead wrong, actually."
About me and everything.
This was for you.
It's an advance copy.
I'd even written a little note on the dedication page and everything.
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.
So you don't get this gift from me.
"Not today, not ever."
"Just because a man has one perfect rose in his garden at home, it doesn't mean that he can't appreciate the flowers of the field."
-Does that make sense?
"-Oh, sure."
"But while you were out sniffing around these other little wildflowers, didn't the rose kind of fade?"
Practically out of the picture.
That's why I reformed.
"Hello, Brandon."
I'm very glad to see you.
"Rosa, this is Isabel Lorrison, an old friend of mine."
-Rosa Senta.
-How are you?
I think I'd better be getting back to my friends.
"-Yes, why don't you?"
-Isabel...
And thank you for keeping Mr. Bourne amused.
You're good for a few laughs yourself.
So long.
You've answered all my questions.
"A year of travel hasn't improved your manners, Isabel."
Was it my manners that interested you?
What interests me now is what you want.
Nothing that should frighten you.
"If you have something to say, say it at once."
-I haven't much time.
"-Oh, not here."
Why not?
Is your Mr. Dawning jealous?
Naturally.
"I may be a year older, Bran, but I haven't lost my touch."
"Let's go for a little walk, for old time's sake, or even just to prove that you're not afraid of the dark."
"You see, Bran, it's not so very dark."
"On the contrary, it's the blaze of noon, Isabel, revealing everything."
If it were some female's handkerchief you would have traced it within a minute.
Look at this!
Uncle will be very happy!
Uncle is very fortunate!
When the rascal Kania doesn't find the dyes his face will be worth a look.
"In fact, Kania's face will be worth a look when he doesn't even find this godown!"
Are you sprinkling rosewater in some marriage or petrol?
- Hurry up. I'm very hungry.
- This petrol is very much like you.
"In appearance, it's as cold as water."
One can never know that it must have so much fire within.
"Looking at you, who would know that all the girls of Mumbai are stuffed up in your little heart!"
Don't you speak like this!
"As it is, where are the girls in Mumbai these days?"
All of them have become Putlibai's!
What are you doing?
- How fast can you run?
- l see...
You want to enter into a race with me?
Not with you but with this fire!
- You want to race with death?
- Life becomes joyful when one runs holding the fingers of death.
What do you say?
Fire is very menacing.
"As soon as it touches petrol, it shoots out like a bullet."
We are no less.
You are a flame.
And I am fire!
What do you say?
- Let's do it.
- Shall we?
Run!
Tells off a Cabinet member like that he's your enemy for life.
Secretary of Urban Development that's the hand that feeds the cities.
"You know, Senator they say a man's stature is determined by his enemies, not his friends."
It also got you the cover of Time.
You're going national Mayor Pappas.
People magazine next.
"That ""stature"" thing."
Who said that?
"I believe I did, a minute ago."
I was having an acute attack of self-importance but it's about to come to an end because here's the man to cut me down to size.
"Kevin, we missed you."
"Sorry, folks."
Didn't mean to interrupt you.
"Kevin's been busy today, I'll bet."
This must be Mrs. Marquand.
It's been quite a day for you.
We don't want any stray bullets around Madison Square Garden.
Ignore the senator.
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
What kind is that?
The kind that'll reelect the President.
Where will you go?
"Second cities, like Chicago?"
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
"The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden, that nominates a Mondale."
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
"At this moment, I can't say."
I will be in touch.
Thank you.
She's gone!
"I came back from the Station House to set up for the show,"
- and she was gone.
- Has this happened before?
She's never been set free.
I don't know what she's capable of.
"This lock, it's faulty."
Did you not notice?
"Sure if I noticed, I would have fixed it, wouldn't I?"
This means the girl could have gotten out the night of the murder.
(indistinct chatter)
Constables will pair off and search for this girl in an orderly fashion.
The local farmers who are upset about their dead livestock will be joining us.
"The armoury has been opened, but only use force if necessary."
"Having said that, be cautious."
This girl could be vicious.
"Crabtree, bring the lads up to speed."
(small chuckle)
Our little man doesn't seem too harmed by his day with the nanny.
I won't be staying for dinner;
I'm joining the search for the missing young woman.
You think she could be the killer?
"I don't know, but I'd rather a mob didn't decide."
- Still have no idea who she is?
- No.
"But in spite of Mr. Travis' claims, she wasn't always feral."
"At the very least, she had a mother who gave birth to her."
"Yes, she did."
"- Are we ready, men?"
I tried to teach this little nigger dog but he just didn't get it. you know what that little fucker did?
He bit me.
You know what happened to that little dog?
My father shot it right in the fucking head.
But you know what I remember also about that day?
My father was still not satisfied.
So I'm not going to kill you.
I don't think I'm going to get the emotional closure I need out of that.
Instead I'm going to fuck pointy tits over here right in the mouth while you watch.
And then I'm going to have Carlo shoot you in the fucking head.
l might get some satisfaction knowing that you'll go to the great beyond wondering if I'm gonna keep her or kill her.
That depends on how good she is.
Fucking step over here now!
Nice doing business with you boys.
Thank you very much.
kid.
- You too.
Love to do it again sometime.
See you around.
don't you think?
That's because dipshit got us lost on the way over.
come on.
don't hang around here too long.
Take it easy.
You take care.
if you're ever in town---
You got it.
Can I drive?
You're lucky you're not walking.
That's a lot of money you got there.
Yeah.
Are you really gonna do this? I think so.
"Nothing with a new girlfriend, no hint that he might be in trouble, or where he might be hiding."
He has quite the fan base.
"Yeah, over 100,000 followers."
Some of these photographs went viral before he became known as an eSports star.
"Over 10,000 shares."
What's so special about that one?
(phone chiming)
Shinwell.
He wants me to meet him first thing in the morning.
You should turn in for the night.
- We're done here.
- What?
Just like that?
"Well, you're fatigued, or else you would've noticed."
"Not only did Tendu's most popular selfie likely motivate the attempt on his life, but the comments section has also given us a promising suspect."
"Ms. Lundquist, you promised your client would come in on her own recognizance."
I could send a couple of detectives.
"I'm sorry, Raina will be here."
"And you'll see, she has nothing to do with whatever this is."
She's a good person.
Can a fanatic be a good person?
"In my experience, the answer's almost always no."
She's not a fanatic.
She's... devoted.
Makes it hard for her to keep a schedule sometimes.
Hi.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
I forgot to charge my car last night.
"Hi, hi."
"I am so, so glad that you granted my request for this meeting."
"And then we broke up, but then we got back together again, and now she thinks that you love her more than ever."
"Oh, honey, I just wanted things... to be better between us."
By doing something completely Shady.
How could I ever trust you again?
Oh...
Honey.
"No, will."
I'm sorry.
"Well, on the plus side he's not getting married."
And you raised a son with enough character... to break up with the wrong girl... even though she has... a truly spectacular set of knockers.
"And the reason I don't have a goiter... is because as an actress, my..."
My vocal chords are so highly developed.
"Well, 's coming."
"Now, um, miss Chase, which of your parents is asian?"
What?
"Well, the disease is only carried... by people of asian descent, so-- ah."
Yes.
"Well, my father, you'll see, is asian."
"Okay, you know what?"
I just--I can't do this.
"You see, I don't really have the disease."
What?
I just said that I did because I thought... it would help me win an emmy.
"Well, that's..."
Reprehensible.
I know.
I--I feel terrible.
As you should.
"Although, in the last week, she has brought the foundation... a great deal of money and attention."
It would be nice not to share offices... with the toenail fungus people.
"Wait, what are you saying?"
"Well, um..."
"As an agent, I will be directing you to do certain things on our behalf."
"And you may be required to testify in court, in future."
"If you disobey my instructions, or conduct any criminal activity, you can be arrested, returned to Canada at any time, from any place and be prosecuted."
"Just in case you were thinking of disappearing in Mexico, taking up the life of leisure with Mr Browne."
You will be paying me for travelling with him?
We will.
And I will get... passport?
Remember...
It can be revoked at any time.
Call George Browne.
"Tell him you've been at the Office all day, you've got your passport... and you'll be at your apartment in an hour."
"I'm sorry I couldn't call, I was at the Passport Office all day."
You can't believe how long it takes.
I will call you when I get home.
"I love you, too."
Very good.
Let's go.
Take this.
It's from Jimmy.
He's gonna call you later and explain.
What's it for?
Francine knows about you.
She's gonna come after you if you show your face around here.
You better go.
"- Hey, Bob!"
"How are you, this evening?"
- Good.
Jimmy's expecting you.
"He's gonna call me, right?"
Take care.
Nice knowing you.
I was the assistant director of the Organised Crime Unit under Inspector Spalding.
Okay.
Mr. Deline.
"You, you and you."
You work pretty fast.
"Well, opportunity knocked, I answered."
Apparently.
"This ghost thing is big, Ed."
"Bookings have skyrocketed, up to a year in advance."
Really?
Yeah.
I guess there's no accounting for taste or judgment.
"Well, that reminds me, I wanna talk to you about Monica's haunted suite."
Listen to me.
"If you mention the ghost one more time like it exists, one of us is crazy and I'm not."
I'm talking about our bottom line.
I've gotten literally hundreds of calls from people wanting to rent the suite.
"Now if the Burkes don't want it, and we buy back Monica's suite and we rent it out..."
Hold it.
It's just...
"No, no, no, no."
I've already run the numbers.
"Even if we pay the Burkes top dollar, we'll still turn a profit within a few months."
We'll make a killing.
We'll make a killing?
"Oh, bad choice of words."
"I've thought about what you proposed, Mr. Burke, Mrs. Burke."
"And since you no longer want the suite,"
"I'm willing to let you out of the deal and, uh, refund your entire purchase price."
"Oh, so now that the place is famous, you want it back."
"Mr. Deline, I am not a fool."
I understand how valuable that suite's become to you.
I was downstairs.
There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel terrible about losing your boy.
But that's on me.
"So if you want revenge, then just shoot me."
You think I blame you for Kevin's death?
Sending those men in was the most courageous thing..
you ever did in your life.
You were a true commander in chief for five minutes.
You just don't have the balls to see the mission through.
What mission?
There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
But there will be.
The Middle East is our last war.
It will be us or them.
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker will be the last American soldier..
to die in that conflict in vain.
You want that as your son's legacy?
Murdering millions of people in his name?
"Mr. President, I wish the pen were mightier than the sword, I do."
But it's just a dream.
"Stand up, sir."
History will judge who the true patriots were here today.
"I've been standing up, Martin, and I'm not gonna open that."
Martin.
"Martin, that's not necessary."
Martin!
How about now?
I can't open this for him.
"If I do, millions of people are gonna die, you understand that?"
I understand.
Goddamn it!
"Tyler, what the hell is going on?"
We got thermal alarms going off in the second floor dining room..
Is that what your girlfriend's gonna do?
Alice isn't being called.
Alice ain't your girlfriend.
"The therapist,dr."
"Thorpe, or didn't she tell you she was being deposed?"
Of course she told me.
"You're sleeping with her, so she'll say nice things about you at the deposition.Smart."
"See,I don't have that option."
A--we're not sleeping together.
Sad but true.B-- she's a therapist.She's got privilege.
She can't say anything.
I don't trust her.
I'm not paying.You lost it.
You pay.
"Kids,kids,kids!"
I'm not gonna support you!
We have them dry-cleaned.
"Well, not this one."
Someone was filling these jugs with something.
There's fresh teeth marks from a wrench here.
I pull the damn pipe out.
"What, do they wash the costumes in the sink?"
Drain the liquid into the jugs?
"Ms. Brandt, we need to see the, uh, bills of lading for the costumes from the tour."
And we're gonna need the outbound and return bills.
I didn't see Laura backstage.
I was busy with costume changes.
You were in South America with her.
With the whole company!
"Anyway, I didn't even know her."
"Every time I did see her, she was in one of those rehearsal rooms, by herself, practicing."
People told us you had a bug problem with your costumes?
I only have one set... but I think I'm going to get the other two for Christmas.
What is all that stuff?
"When I get married, all this stuff will belong to my husband and my daughter."
Everything I have here will be theirs.
All of it.
It's my dowry.
This is called a hope chest.
Or trousseau in French.
So Peter was barfing?
I asked the neighbor woman to go get him.
It's like how they say it takes a village to raise a child.
"If you'll excuse me, this is a private call."
So Robby's old enough to walk home alone?
Shit lords!
There's no answer.
Robby loves to answer the phone.
"If he was there, he'd be answering it."
Maybe Peter went out looking for Robby.
"Yeah, see, this is why you don't want a village raising your kid... because there's sketchy parts of the village... and some of the villagers are junkies and child molesters."
I gotta go.
Tell Sven that Robby's missing and I had to go.
Thanks for calling.
"For customer service or furniture or mattress delivery inquiries, press 4."
"For bridal registry, press 6."
- Mann res-
- Is Robby here?
- Mann residence.
May I help you?
- Is Robby here?
No.
"If you didn't know me, would you think I was really this tall... or would you think I was standing on something?"
You're here.
"Back in my slut-around days, as soon as I would roll into a club,"
I would lock down the hottest beef on the grill.
"If some club skank tried to snatch my catch,"
"I would hog-tie the bitch with her own extensions, and I would take back my man!"
"I would claim that ""D""!"
You know what I'm saying?
I really don't.
But I can't wait to hear how it ties in with children.
"If you and the kids had such a great thing, why should you let another teacher"
- step in and take over?
- You're right!
That was my class.
"I mean, I took those kids on a funky-fresh trip to 1990 and back."
You know what time it is?
Time to... ♪ pump up the jam ♪
Yay!
Roger Frank is gonna rue the day
- he took on Andy Torres.
"- Okay, remember, if we get made, we finger the council and say everyone's on the take."
Where did you learn all this cool con-man lingo?
What do you think?
Law school paid for itself?
"Now, then, it is time to serve"
Roger Frank and his Dustybear Financial a little slice of payback pie.
Dustybear Financial-- why does that sound familiar?
- Boo!
Don't let the payback pie get cold!
- Right!
"- Oh, hey!"
Are you here for the show?
- I don't know.
"Grayson texted me and said,"
I need another.
- I'll do it.
- Go climb at the terrace... and stand on the other side of the balcony rail.
"Pierre, mon cher, we need a vision."
"The year, 1323, no... 1324."
The setting:
"A stony alcove in the alps of the Capuleto... hanging from the rocky, gelid cliffs of Stratfordshire."
"Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a post perceptive chilling the air."
"The tempest has fled to bomir pastures, but its icy kiss lingers."
The mood:
Unbridled passion... a passion that unravels nature's tiring volcanoes... and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods... so is this union.
You need to show Romeo and Juliette how to pose.
And you can bet your sweet ass I will.
Romeu:
"You've just been running in from Mars... you're hot and sweaty, but you're taking some danger."
"Juliette is looking hot, you know what I'm trying to mean?"
"I want the body language to be a lot more charged, okay?"
So move a lot tight closer together.
"Look into your Juliette's eyes and...""Oh!"
"Romeo, Romeo""..."
"""where art thou"", boy."
"Come on, open your heart... and show some love, some affection for her."
And Juliette... you love this man!
Oh!
Yes!
You know he's your knight in shiny armor.
I like that!
"Hold that, I'm gonna take some Polaroid photos."
"Alex, move your ass."
Move your ass.
"Out, please."
"But, uh, it turns out an antiques dealer"
Had it in Tokyo in the 1920s.
Now it's here in Washington.
"Artie, it's at the secret service."
What the hell's it doing there?
"Well, the Japanese government presented it"
In the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace.
Guess that didn't work out so well.
And the curator at the Wilson museum of peace
Made the connection a couple days ago
And offered it to be united with the sword
At the gift ceremony.
"But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremonies,"
So it's going back to the museum in the morning.
The sword and the tsuba in D.C. at the same time.
"No, no, no."
That's--that's too much coinc--
Too much coincidence.
"Well, Artie, we're sitting on the secret service building."
"But, look, if this thief is--is coming to get the tsuba,"
We have to warn Dickinson.
"No, no. absolutely not."
"Well, Artie, you saw what this guy's willing to do."
"Yeah, and--and so did you."
And imagine what he's capable of with the sword.
"No, no, no. this thief is ruthless and smart."
"So if you warn the secret service,"
And they do anything out of the ordinary--
Anything at all-- then he will be tipped off.
So you want to use him as bait.
"- No, Artie."
No.
- Then you must not give up.
There's no one here with a greater love or-or knowledge of music.
And that's the key.
You must show him... that his musical career is not over.
You can't let him waste that precious talent that God has given him.
"Thank you, Father."
"""Big surprise dinner party."""
"""Spectacularly unforgettable."""
Did you ever consider renting your mouth out to the motor pool as a garage?
"Beej, if we don't come up with something soon... we're gonna be modeling the latest in tar-and-feather wear."
- Let's attack this rationally.
- I'd rather attack you irrationally.
Come on.
Think back.
You remember some special dinner party you once went to?
Sure.
Lucia Murphy's 1 4th birthday.
We played spin the bottle and sent out for Chinese food.
"Now, there's a nice touch of home."
Dinner just like Mao used to make.
"Hawk, admit it."
No matter what kind of spectacular food we come up with... as soon as it hits those tin trays on those crummy tables in that rotten tent... it's still gonna be a mess.
So we won't have it in the tent.
What can we eat outside?
- Dirt.
- No!
A picnic!
We'll have a cookout.
Wait a minute.
Wait a-
- W-W-Wait!
I just got a great idea that will save us from a lifetime of death.
Poison?
Yes.
The kind that kills innocent young doctors.
"I don't know anything about poison and even if I did, I wouldn't say anything."
"If you want to survive around here, you see nothing, you hear nothing and you say nothing."
You gave your child to the Church?
"Yes, to Sainte-Genevieves."
Sainte-Genevieves?
Yes.
A refuge for orphans and families just outside of Paris.
"They feed them, clothe them, teach them a trade."
"Hopefully, something not the same as mine."
"Here, take another day off."
My saucy little Hector!
Yes!
I think I may return to my rooms.
"No, you will stay here with me."
"Otherwise, I shall have no one to talk to and that will be embarrassing."
As you wish.
Bitch!
I tbelieve you delivered this to the wrong person.
"No, I have delivered it to the Marquise de Maintenon."
My heartfelt congratulations.
I don't understand.
"Iside, you will find the deeds and title to the Maintenon estate that the King himself offers you, in your name."
This is absurd.
I have no taste for titles and such things.
You soon will have.
"Gaston De Foix's newfound wealth, where does it come from?"
"well, certainly not the gambling tables."
"His losses this month have come into thousands, though he has always payed on time."
"By the way, I encountered a friend of yours, yesterday in Paris."
Go get on your flight.
"Ma'am, get over here!"
"Why are you trying to feed infants?"""
"Anyways, that's my airport jaunt."
"If you think Jesus was white, you're not allowed to have an opinion on gun control."
Not everyone's gonna agree.
"We know now, more than ever, education's expensive."
"Also some people in the crowd are like, ""But Jesus was white."""
And you're doing the best.
I want to live like that.
I can't.
I gotta be up here.
I gotta look into it.
"All I'm saying is, if you guys want real change, you gotta limit some people's ability to vote."
I know.
I know.
I know.
It doesn't sound progressive.
Neither does genocide.
People hate genocide.
Why?
Because it's been used horrifically every single time it's been used throughout history?
That doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.
"If I told you guys tomorrow that we were gonna round up all of the racist, homophobic people and kill them, you're telling me all the smart people wouldn't be like..."
"""Well, shit, we haven't tried that version."
"That might actually have an impact."""
Maybe it's not based on skin color or religion.
"Maybe it's just, ""Who's the dick?"
Get him out.
"Get him out of here."""
Lump in global warming deniers.
Let's clean house.
Staying together would be stranger.
You of all people should understand that.
What do you mean?
"The man on your cell phone wallpaper isn't this detective here, is it?"
"So cops have affairs, too!"
You had an affair with Ikezawa.
"No, I didn't."
Then why run away with him?
We both knew we were drawn to each other.
"He was an apprentice chef, and I was the chef's wife."
We honestly didn't have a physical relationship.
"When my husband got drunk, he used to get violent and hit me."
The restaurant itself... was renovated from a restaurant that my father had operated.
I was the owner.
My father put in all the money.
My husband had a complex about it.
He would drink and then hit me...
Ikezawa sympathized with me.
He always offered some kind words to me.
But he stole your proceeds.
I suggested we take the money and run.
That makes you an accomplice.
"That's right, I'm just as guilty as he is."
"She won't talk, she wins as long as she keeps silent for 20 hours."
"That's it, I'm taking her in."
Stand up.
I'm taking you no matter what.
Fine.
"But first I need to go to the restroom, okay?"
"Please, pick up!"
"Yasuo, get out of there, hurry!"
A cop came here as a customer and I got caught.
I think today would count...as one.
You know what I think she would like even more... is to see you wear it.
I couldn't possibly take it...
"Be careful, be careful this won't heal if you move around too much."
"If you want to help, tell me about that prison."
What kind of security do they have?
"Are there force fields, detection grids, physical barriers?"
"Yes, all of it."
What about guards?
Lots of guards.
The Mokra make a big show of it... always bragging about how no one has ever escaped.
Listen to me...
I can't bring you to the prison with me.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not afraid.
And that could get both of us killed.
You have to stay here.
If I stay here I can't bring the letters.
Letters...to the prison?
Letters.
Don't you remember how we used to write to her together?
Here they are.
I still write them... every week since she's been gone.
I've always known that one day
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.
I've never forgotten.
These are all to your wife?
How long has it been?
My last letter... my last letter's not... it's not here.
"Oh, I wrote it three days ago, butit's...is not..."
"I can't let her think I've stopped writing... that I gave up hope only, only days before..."
It's fucking amazing.
Do you know how few people reach this level?
You seem to not care.
I really don't.
Did you ask me here so you could talk about yourself?
Next question.
Does talking about this stuff make you feel happy?
No.
I find thinking about it all to be unfulfilling and exhausting.
Does nothing for me.
"Well, that's how the rest of your life is gonna be."
Unfulfilling and exhausting.
I think success has made you ugly.
"I think you've gotten far too in touch with your selfish instincts, and it's not healthy."
But I still think about you.
I think the guy I used to know would have made a really great boyfriend.
I want to take that cupcake out of your hand right now and throw it so fucking far away from you.
"Goddamn it, you make me sick."
You're just a big baby.
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.
You're the worst.
"I'm not successful, I'm notable."
There's a difference.
"Besides, I'm not notable, either."
Noteworthy at best.
I once considered you my favourite ex-girlfriend.
That's very sweet of you.
Let's...
"let's turn this day around, do something fun."
"Maybe, I don't know, break into a bank, or rob a car or something."
"- All right, let's do it."
- Sorry to barge in on you.
"- No, no, no, no."
I'm just watching your girl.
- First female prime ministers?
- They were great leaders.
Would you put Thatcher in that category?
"No, I don't think so."
- You know what?
I would have to say Thomas Jefferson.
- A man?
"- She's something, isn't she?"
- I don't really know her.
"We served together a few years ago, and, I guess... we just ended up in different company."
- Take a seat.
"- Congressman, the president asked us to come down here."
He'd like to let you know he'd appreciate your support in the senator's confirmation.
- Really?
"- He asked me directly, Shell."
But the president didn't consider it important enough to ask me personally?
You know it's important.
It's the old man's swan song.
Putting a woman in office means something to him.
Laine Hanson's the absolute best choice.
You don't believe that.
Come on.
You're too smart.
"Look, I don't mind she's a woman... but I'm not confirming a woman just because she's a woman."
Laine Hanson has an extra burden.
She's has to come on the world stage with perfect credentials.
Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect credentials.
The world respected her.
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher because they knew she had to answer to Ronald Reagan.
"Even if his prohibition is removed, my store is off limits!"
But who is this Unni?
Is she a doctor from the medical team from Korea?
She is!
That ethanol scent!
Who is she?
She is a full-time emergency relief team nurse assigned from Peace Maker.
It seems she works part-time in the hardware store.
"Ah, she does a meaningful job, which doesn't give much money."
"I'm doing it because it's fun, and you don't need money."
"But then Oppa, are you a fortune teller?"
How did you know my full-time and part-time job?
"I think I heard it from Daniel, about his Korean-Russian wife."
"What do you mean ""wife""?"
We're just comrades.
But what did you come here to buy?
There's everything except Daniel.
Can we use the wifi?
Wifi?
"Let's see, the fi is..."
Are you sure that the wifi works here?
"If you search thoroughly, I'm sure they will even have missiles."
Wait here after you finish your business.
It'll just be one hour.
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.
Don't fight.
She has a gun.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
I'm definitely sure there's a modem around here somewhere.
"On Friday at 0900, we apprehended two men who are assumed to be black market dealers, and passed them over to the authorities."
Report complete.
"But let's say, that this point here is your happy face after those spicy rice cakes."
And here is your nice face worrying about a sick friend.
And here is your face sitting on the toilet.
"If we connect these points, then, we get a shape like this, right?"
Yes.
"But this is something we are not used to, so it's hard to grasp."
"Anyhow, it would still be closer to the real thing than this triangle."
"So if we continue our efforts, we can overcome this stereotypical and evil image."
"We can break them, you know."
So we have to try to see these other points together as well.
You know what I'm saying?
You are amazing.
How did you come up with this?
This is how I'm fighting right now.
That's a really good way to look at it.
Think so?
You really are smart.
Hello?
"I'm sorry, but I'm the person you saw this morning."
I wasn't sure if it was okay to go up.
"Oh, yes."
But I think my wallet is in there.
I can't find it anywhere.
Could you please look for it?
I'm down here now at the front desk.
Wallet?
Where did you put it?
"Well, maybe on the table or the floor."
Or near the bed.
I have important things in there.
"Well, I already cleaned the room and didn't find anything."
Hold on.
"Oh, right."
"That's very sensible of you, very male."
"You know, that guy really made me sick."
Hi.
"Leo, I've finished the histology on Dawn Pivcevic and all the organs are normal except for this."
I think the endometrium shows changes of pregnancy and there's a cluster of cells from an embryo.
She was pregnant?
"Yes, just a few days."
You were lucky to sample the right bits for histology.
"They couldn't get pregnant, that's why they'd come off IVF."
It's not unusual for couples to come off IVF and then get pregnant.
That's how Theresa got pregnant with Cassie.
Morning sickness.
She was making the doll throw up.
Who?
The little girl at the scene.
"She wasn't re-enacting Dawn's death, she must have seen her vomiting at some time."
Early stages of pregnancy could bring on nausea and vomiting and faintness.
Especially with the remaining hormones from the IVF.
And if she got a bit tipsy...
She could easily faint.
"How am I going to explain to the husband that his wife, who couldn't get pregnant, got pregnant, which in part killed her?"
If it wasn't so tragic it would be a joke.
Hello.
Hi.
We've met before.
At the garden centre.
"Oh, yes."
Didn't you work for Henry Elliot?
Yes.
"Ah, is Detective Chief Inspector Tom Wimber here?"
"No, I'm afraid not."
I believe it's some kind of weapon.
A picture of my dead mother.
How come you're putting it in the box?
"Because I don't know why my dad keeps all of her pictures hidden in the attic, and tells me she looked like Grace Kelley."
Who's Grace Kelley?
"Oh, she was a very famous clown."
She was a princess.
"And, also..."
I don't know what it's like to have a mother.
We could tell you.
You can't tell somebody something like that.
Have you ever noticed that girls don't fart?
My mom farts.
Looks like a boob.
Yeah.
Make them fly around.
My boob's bigger than yours.
Let's see if you can catch my boob.
"You've got, like, a mosquito bite boob, Frank."
Why don't girls spit?
They're hiding something from us.
The rules have changed.
Gotcha.
"It's a battle of the sexes... and believe me, we are way behind."
Shit!
I can't dance.
"You see this, Frank?"
This little seedling represents an entire species of marsh grass.
"If it lives, the wetlands will survive,"
"Mortlake turtle can return to its natural habitat, and birds like the glossy ibis won't lose another precious nesting place."
"Dad, if you don't get dressed, we'll be late for school."
"Dad, if you don't get dressed, we'll be late for school."
And we are not a group that you want picketing in your lobby.
I'm really sorry Miss Stewart but the difference.
Between you and your friend isn't academic or fluid related.
"Miss Truscott held part-time jobs, she was a cheerleader."
She was on the volleyball team The skateboard club the surf club.
And you.
Were a tricycle-riding pirate mascot for half a basketball game.
And in 12th grade you climbed a rope.
That sucker went all the way to the ceiling.
Yes I think you mentioned that in your essay.
"""To the Ceiling and Back:"
"A Girl, a Rope and a Dream."""
Which was exactly the required 500 words.
And Lilly's was 502.
"Just saying, rule follower, rule breaker."
Miley you are an excellent student.
But you don't have any extra-curricular activities.
And here at Stanford we're looking for students with a skosh more.
But come on you have to let me in.
This is the only college I applied to.
This is the only school you applied to?
You know on one hand that could sound incredibly dumb.
But on the other hand it could be a display of admirable school spirit.
Doesn't show up on a test but honey at the pep rally.
I will skosh you up one side and down the other.
Go Stanford!
Whoo-hoo!
Huh-uh!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey!
"Okay, please."
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
- Has anybody else seen them?
Only Selena.
She thinks I'm a genius.
What do you think?
Are they good enough to send to a magazine?
"Yes, if you want to end up in prison."
Those stories were full of enough libel and slander and double-entendre to hang us all.
"Allison, is that how Peyton Place really looks to you?"
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.
Those stories were a good start.
"Now, where do you go from here?"
That's what I hoped to find out from you.
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...
"Thank you, but I don't want to go to college."
I never have.
Why not?
Because I don't want to study about writing.
I want to write.
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare was a wonderful writer or that wonderful books have already been written.
Those books tell you how and why.
I'd rather find that out myself at a typewriter.
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.
"All right if that's how you feel about it, then let's do it."
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.
"Who said I was a cynical, hard-hearted newspaperman?"
"You are such a miser man,"
Calvin Kline didn't made underwear like this.
"Don't speak in public, This man... gave me electric shocks."
If electricity gone then hits me on inverter.
"You don't cry, you just ask him."
Tell him about Sunday.
This Sunday or last Sunday?
"Shut up you question answer, speak straight, Pinto!"
"Don't be angry, You don't interfere, Batla Bhai!"
You're like my younger son.
"That's why I am telling you, Who killed your Hira Lal?"
"We killed him, Now that Hira Lal... where he's gone to hide that diamond?"
How do I know?
"You tell me,"
"You must know little little, Your memory has gone week,"
"Which Diamond, which car, she was that car."
Papa!
These two are the same.
"Speak, Where is the diamond?"
"I don't know, very good Chandu, don't tell them, no matter what you lost your life, but don't tell them."
Chandu!
Where is the diamond?
"Stupid, what are you doing, tell them it's in the petrol tank,"
In petrol tank?
"Diamond is mine, diamond is mine."
I bought the car then diamond is mine.
"I came here to buy car, diamond is mine, I have a Gun."
"So diamond is mine, Papa."
"But petrol tank is not opening, Then how could we get the diamond?"
"Ok, all you people turn it down,"
What are you doing?
Vomit!
What Musa and I have struggled for is worth more than any one single person.
It's about our species' survival.
We've all had to make sacrifices.
"Now tell me, I was yours."
"The bond between Hunters is different, deeper than humans."
"We're not just family, we're inside each other, it's how we're made."
Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Like a part of me was ripped from my flesh.
"And I never forgot it, Allison, never."
Not one day has gone past when I haven't thought of you.
You... are a part of me.
And I love you.
"I love you, too."
That hollow in your back is sacred.
That's where we carry our young in their native form.
You defiled it because you despise yourself.
I blame your father for that.
"Ted ruined you, Allison, and yet I'm the one you hate."
You were born a Hunter!
You know how you came to look like you do?
"I chose this body for you, a vehicle to keep you safe and strong."
You killed someone for their body?
For you!
I chose well.
- I was a child.
A baby!
- That baby would have died anyway.
"Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum."
I did it a favor and I did it for you!
Stop!
No!
There's water in the tap.
"Is it alright then, Jon?"
Well done Catrin.
"When there's raid, I want you to go down the tube station."
I didn't bring you all the way from Wales to see you get hit by a bomb.
I saw April today.
She and Tony have made up ever such clear code.
So you can write to him about what she's doing.
'The Veg green' that means England. 'Onion Soup' is France.
There's a word for regiment and one for troop...
Oh....
"Do you really have to smoke that thing, Ambrose?"
Wouldn't you just mind?
I can mind smoking.
I can't mind smoke.
That's a cut.
I wonder would it be possible to have something to do?
My hands are aching for something to do.
And it seems alright for the character.
"Perhaps, try to find some knitting?"
Water or word.
"I fully understand the national importance of what we are shooting, and obviously, there's no question of diluting the message."
I just...
I wonder if it might impact a little more punch if Mr.Brown would express a little more.
"For example, the mention of the clever code, I might say, ""Well, that will be the first clever thing, April has ever done in her life"""
Did you...do you see?
Just a...just a dash of...of humor and then follow it on.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh!
Certainly.
Oh!
No.
I gave my daughter.
My mother told me that was the worst mistake I ever made.
Is a terrible thing what he said.
If I were your mother
I would be very proud of you.
"Alice, long time was a lost soul."
I did not know who he was.
"One night a drunk date party and went into a dark room, and I let a stranger me cogiera until disappeared."
"There were no names or faces, only touch."
"Sometimes when you're lost, when you're totally lost,"
It is when you you find yourself.
Darkens the eyes of all and write up jobs.
"Plumber, IT consultant, Mrs. cleaning, accountant ..."
Dolly in part front and in the middle.
"""Queen of the swingers"" or something like that."
The final at the hotel is the icing on the cake.
You go there as a couple and takes all photos.
"Orgies, ugly, sex anal ... all those weird."
Do not.
"What do you mean ""no""?"
Much time and money
She has been invested in this.
We're about to print.
"If I do this, I will my way by myself."
"Alice, could talk at least?"
Where are you going now?
I have to finish my story.
"You like stories, right?"
"What's what you want from me, Alice?"
It's very simple.
Are we going to stay together and grow old despite all this shit or not?
"Because if not, then we are losing time."
..against him then too I wont believe it.
How did you believe it?
Who is the fool who believes that Krishna has stolen anything?
Then.. then why did you do this?
"Its very simple, Janki."
Try and understand.
I can tolerate anything but when someone..
..tells Krishna anything it pierces in me like an arrow .
Today that arrow pierced my heart when..
..those people called him a thief.
I have controlled my injured hurt with great difficulty.
I have raised this hand with great difficulty to hit him.
I told him to get out of this house with great difficulty.
But.. butjust think..
where will he go?
"The world is very big, Janki."
He can go anywhere.
And.. after a few bumps he will also learn to get steady.
"No, I wont let him drift like that."
"No Janki, you still dont know my brothers."
You didnt think that after I die..
- No.
Dont say that.
"-Yes, Janki."
You didnt think what they will do..
..to that poorthing after I die.
He.. he cant stay in this house and understand that..
..because he has a clean heart.
But why send him like this even if we want to?
"He wont understand any otherway, Janki."
And he will never be able to leave us and go.
Sir.. bless me with the hands you beat me.
- How?
- Go back to the wreck for some cable.
- You can't go back up there.
- I'll just have to.
Just sit here and shut up.
Can you do that?
- It'll be dark soon.
- You afraid of the dark?
I was thinking of you coming back down.
"Hey, kid..."
I'm sorry.
I'll get you down in the morning.
- Did it look like an airplane?
- Can't say for sure.
- What can you say for sure?
- It was a flash out the corner of my eye.
"It might have been wings, it might have been a couple of trees."
Could you have gone back to make sure?
It's pretty hard to tell one ridge from the other.
"Besides, I was running low on gas and worried about getting back myself."
- Show me on the map.
"- Well, that was the other problem."
My compass was messing up on me.
I didn't know where I was.
"Not until I saw the rail line running into Baker, somewhere around here."
You let your pilots fly without knowing where they are?
The wind blew me down there.
You can't always tell what the wind's going to do.
You're talking about hundreds of square miles - and suppose you were wrong?
You'd be responsible for sending everybody in the wrong direction.
You were right to report the sighting.
But you see the problems it caused.
"But, Daaga..."
- It's quite simple.
"Ifyou keep an eye on Vijay Varma, and find out details about  people he meets, then it is possible to identify his informer."
Did you read the news about your friend?
He risked his life in a dangerous chase and seized 8 millions in gold.
This kind of daredevily is his forte.
My friend is a incredible police officer!
He is an incredible police officer.
And you are a remarkable lawyer.
The only difference is that he catches criminals... and I free them.
Doesn't any misunderstanding arise bemeen you mo friends on this regard?
-No way.
No chance.
We don't mix our friendship with our profession.
I can give my life for him.
"Ifyou mo are such friends, please include me in your list too."
Who doesn't need a good friend?
"Madam, I have written your name in my list at first sight."
I must entertain you well.
How about one more coffee?
"No, thanks."
I must say something.
Our friendship seems to be a one way traffic.
ARer that pam I have come a dozen times over to your house.
But you haven't set your foot in my humble home.
Not even once.
There's nothing as such.
Someday I will certainly set my foot at your celestial abode.
Thank you vey much!
I want to speak to Mr Vijay.
Speaking.
Who is it?
Dale Roach.
He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.
The things they did to us at Sands View.
I promise you I will get these bastards.
"If Bains killed Danny,"
I'd lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.
You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.
"(Cockney accent) lf you want a way out, you'll listen to me."
Did he ever mention any other names?
"Politicians, coppers?"
Single-handedly brings in an APO...
"Welcome back, Dot."
(Phones ringing)
"BENTON""."
I'd just like to get on with my life.
"Ms Denton, I'm Gill Biggeloe, Legal Counsel to AC-l 2."
Mm.
I imagine they keep you very busy.
Ha.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As pan of a new initiative christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
There seems to be an oversight.
Some of the officers involved in my wrongful conviction are missing.
"Superintendent Hastings, as Senior Investigating Officer, represents the whole team."
"Well, I want them here."
"Or this new box you need to tick just... well, won't get ticked."
God give me strength.
Thank you.
It wouldn't have been the same without you.
"Ms Denton, on behalf of this department and this constabulary,"
Will it be okay if it comes from me?
It's not like I have to like you with an effort now.
I've always liked you.
But I never felt that you could be the one for me.
"But now that I think of it, it all makes sense."
"I like you, Sadhana."
Really?
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
A small word said in passing
"It is chilly, it is true, listen"
You added sweetness to what you spoke
My masculinity is stunned.
Should I say slowly
Or increase the speed?
Should I leave after saying or pause right there?
Should I pinch at the love that was said
Or should I lose myself to the love that was grabbed by my hands
I realize today that there may be a thousand changes to the sight.
I see myself through your eyes conveying love.
I am seeing you with a pouring love... that I have collected.
I am gently bringing to your ears the words I collected slowly.
I put my hands out to get a raindrop...
It remained just as a drizzle.
What do you think you're doing?
- My office!
Now!
"Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal."
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence?
Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.
I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
Tris!
Tris!
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
"I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave."
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
- I will not be a party to violence.
- No-one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
"- One, what?"
- One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive others and yourself."
You're hurting Tris.
And my heart goes out to you.
I know what it's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love.
I'm a celebrity chef.
That's my craft.
"I've cooked for Nathan Lane,"
Martha Stewart
"Martin Short, Don Rickles,"
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.
"Hot, hot, hot, hot."
And they've all loved my food.
Coming across.
"Coming across, hot."
"Oh, [bleep]."
Have you seen the trash anywhere?
Oh.
"I guess all I have to do is turn around, right?"
"They think I'll play that cute factor, you know?"
Let's put it this way.
Everybody is looking for you.
So leave or I'm calling the cops.
Leave.
"Hello, gentlemen."
How are you?
- Don't get too close or I'll vomit.
- You never used to say that.
"You see one of my men behind my back, you blackmail him, you appropriate my work."
You really are the height of elegance.
"Hello, everyone."
"Please, don't get up."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief."
"So, the Butcher of la Villette has been freed erroneously."
"Whatever the mistakes made in this case, it is now time to apply all the means possible to stop this psychopath before he kills again or leaves the country."
"The Crime Squad is officially in charge, but I wish for all squads to collaborate on the case and to forward all useful information to Superintendent Bremont."
"I beg you not to fight each other in a sterile war, but to bring your strength together to hunt this predator."
She is our world.
A peaceful life.
No big wish list.
We were happy with what was given to us by God.
But...
We didn't understand what doctor said about her disease.
We understood only one thing.
It required lot of money.
"If we don't start the treatment soon, the disease will spread all over her body, and she will die."
"From then on, she fought the disease, and we fought for money."
All our savings were spent on her initial treatment.
The situation was out of our hands.
We had no money.
"Even now, we have no complaints on anyone except on our incapability to save her."
"The day she looked at us to save her life, we died."
"If the operation is not performed in 24 hours, she too will lose  die."
We had no choice.
We can't see her die.
"So, we sent her an orphanage, and dying before her."
Please don't mistake us.
We had no other choice.
You're often asking for charity.
Is this for you or for everyone?
For me only.
"So, you know the truth."
It's alright.
Father went to bring money.
He will bring it.
Operation will be over.
"It's you who said that if we get things very easily, there will no kick in it."
It's true.
"If death comes easier, there is no kick in it."
Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island...
Have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
That's very odd.
There's an opening in the ground.
Is this the back door?
That's not natural.
We want to take a look at the well.
Down to the water!
Might there be clues down there?
What the hell's that?
Do you see that?
- Wow.
- Down slow.
This well may be associated with the Templars.
- Whoa!
"- What do you got, Tony?"
"Right here on these rocks, I've got a triangle."
This thing's amazing.
There is an island in the North Atlantic where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years.
"So far, they have found bits of gold chain, a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, even a 17th century Spanish coin."
"To date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery."
"And, according to legend, one more will have to die before the treasure can be found."
"Jack, why don't you hack that tree out of the way."
- Wow.
- That's my big discovery.
"Well, honestly, David, that is quite odd."
"A few days ago, during a meeting in the war room,"
"Rick, Marty and members of the Oak Island team were introduced to New York based writer and researcher Zena Halpern by area historian Doug Crowell."
- Hello?
"- Hi, Zena, it's Doug."
"I don't have a problem with hugging, either."
Get away from me!

To repeat:
"In a press conference just held, the Beijing government has announced that if there are no signs of a resolution by 6:00, the situation will inevitably develop into a serious crisis."
"In response, Secretary-General Chang of South China, also known as the Democratic Federation of China, questioned if there was some connection to the terrorist acts committed by the unidentified AS..."
Listen up.
"We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" If we fail, that's it."
"If we fail, that's it."
Hong Kong will become a sea of flames.
And I doubt it will stop there.
You kept her face pretty?
Apparently you're soft on women.
Haven't you found Yu Fang yet?
All of the preparations are complete.
Just watch.
"Big Sis, this is Yu Lan!"
I'm surrounded by all these scary men!
Try and rest.
"You know, Nathan, the dying have taught me one thing... that you can look death in the face and go on living."
Our mission here is to keep them company.
Keep company with those about to die so that they can depart in peace.
"Great, but what's it got to do with me?"
"Me, my."
"My little consciousness, my little comforts, my little life."
"What about others, Nathan, do you ever think about them?"
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?
"If you knew he was going to blow his brains out, why didn't you do something?"
Why didn't you try to listen to him?
"Who kept Dennis company so he'd ""depart in peace?"""
"Anyway, how did you know he was going to die?"
"This time I want an answer, none of your..."
- I saw it.
- You saw it?
- Yes.
- How did you see it?
Was it written on his face?
- Yes.
- Yes?
"Listen, I'm beat."
"I didn't sleep last night because of you,"
- and I've got to be at work...
"- Nathan, people who come here, they've already traveled a long road paved with suffering."
But they have had time to prepare themselves.
But often death comes... unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.
"Yes, I know, yes."
"For instance, say you cross the street at the wrong moment, or the body just gives out..."
just like that.
"Hilarious, right?"
Totally.
You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes... probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner... smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while she was waiting to pick her kids up
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady."
"And I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist... the one wearing the male birth control.
"I was gonna go with ""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
- All right?
He's a hero.
- Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff, I have a date."
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
- Great.
I will.
I promise you.
"Farewell, cousin."
What is the rush?
"I pray you tell, My Lord, I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear it shall be Romeo, whom I hate, rather than Paris, whom I despise!"
Here comes your father.
You can tell him so yourself.
My girl is like a channel.
"What, more tears?"
The level of the sea will start to lift if much more water flows from your sweet eyes.
"Wife, have you told her of her marriage plans?"
"I have, and she will have none of it, I swear."
Soft.
Soft.
"Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
How?
Will she none?
Does she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?
"Does she not think her blessed, unworthy as she is, that we have brought so worthy a gentleman to be her groom?"
"Thankful I am, and grateful for your love, but proud I cannot be of what I hate."
"How... how-how-how, chopped logic."
What is this?
"""Proud"" and ""I thank you,"" but ""I thank you not."""
"Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds!"
"Be ready, lady, Thursday morning next, to go with Paris to St. Peter's Church"
- or I will drag thee thither on a rail!
- Are you mad?
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees."
Will you not give me leave to plead my cause?
You...
I tell you what.
Leave my house!
You either get dressed up and behave like you have some self respect you'd just leave!
"Steve, will you fix me a drink please?"
Sure.
Having a problem with the Neanderthal man back there?
Yeah.
"Relax, you're fabulous."
Don't make a penny of domestic quarrels.
What are you staring at big cock?
Sorry I wish I knew how to tell you...
"If you got something to say copper, just spit it out."
You are in a dangerous situation.
"Man, listen let me tell you something you guys won't catch me, man, never!"
And I don't understand why you're being so stupid copper to let me know what's coming down that's really dumb.
Copper?
"What does that mean, I can help you."
"Fuck off, get out of my way."
"You don't understand, I can help you."
Oh!
You're a rat man.
"You want me to put you on the take, so you'll let me know when your invasion come in?"
Invasion?
Yeah what do you know about the invasion?
"Oh, shut your face scab, I don't play it your way."
"Just forget it fuck off, man!"
I don't need you man!
Fuck off!
Still sitting in front of the mirror.
Adrian is here.
I didn't come here to see Adrian.
Well I don't have any dope for you.
You have to see her about that.
"Hmph, monster."
You should have just behaved and stayed shut away in school.
Kiefer...
Is she alive?
She's already been thrown into prison here.
"To begin with, who would have expected her to come back?"
"Years ago, the eldest of her sisters died in a spy crackdown."
The remaining two received our country's reeducation.
"We had the younger sister remain here, as a sign of loyalty to our country."
Wouldn't it be quicker to just say you took her hostage?
She was a foolish girl as well.
"Even though her younger sister is dead since long ago, in the end, she was worthless."
Nothing is accomplished as long as the Astal brat survives.
So he was your real target.
Do you have any idea how much of a reprimand we got from those people?
Is that what you called me here for?
To complain and moan?
"Mind your tongue, monster!"
Ow...
That one hurt a little.
Of course it did!
Are you mocking me?
You're the one doing the mocking here.
I'm always the one being mocked.
I've had enough punishment.
Could you throw me in jail before I drop dead?
"The king will grant one request, with your imprisonment."
"I'd sure like to stop this bleeding, but..."
"Oh, I know."
"Hey, Kiefer."
"If you keep taking afternoon naps, your grades will drop."
What's this?
"- Come on, boys, get a move on."
- You always say the people are on our side.
So why do they treat us like this?
They stare at us as if we were animals.
"To them, we're no better than the government troops."
"If I were you, I'd alter my behaviour."
Then this will change.
This stuff will give you every disease in the world.
"- Shit, I've been hit really badly."
"- Nonsense, we'll fix that."
This is madness.
Who will benefit from us blowing up the dam?
"Put him here, but carefully."
Why do we destroy bridges and farmers' houses and everything they own?
"You're an engineer, not a revolutionary."
The commandante will know why.
He might not know either.
Do you have a smoke?
"We haven't got any dressing material, but there's a hospital in San Juan."
They might cure him.
There's a priest there who knows something about medicine.
You know so much.
It's kind of you to try to help us.
"If you take me with you, I'll help you fight as well."
I always win at war games.
I'm the fastest one when it comes to climbing trees.
"At war, climbing trees is the most important thing."
"He's right with one thing, Mariá."
José has to be taken to San Juan.
You should go with him.
"Jaime, Getullio and another man will accompany you."
- But I thought...
But I know someone who can beat the Shaolin.
Which chamber does he belong?
He's not a priest.
He's Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung-wu!
"According to our regulations, a guilty person cannot be our representative."
"Furthermore, Chao Fung-wu isn't our student..."
He's the only one who knows how to fight the Chin Kang Fist.
"If he can represent us, he can win."
Then all charges will be dropped.
That's a good point.
"If he wins, he'll be pardoned."
"$50,000, they do pass."
"$50,000, they don't."
I smell a rat.
Been dead at least 24 hours.
My sensors detect the vehicle is armored with my protective shell.
He took the bait.
We hooked him real good.
I was always strongly attracted to you.
"Michael, he's coming right for us!"
"Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist."
"michael Knight, a young loner, on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law."
"michael, I've searched my data banks thoroughly,"
I can't find one redeeming quality about gambling.
"KITT, look at it this way:"
gambling is all odds.
It's pure mathematics.
"Come on, I'll show you."
I'd rather not.
"A little computer blackjack, $1 a hand."
Then why did you expect me?
Be seated.
Come on out with it.
Quick.
I can't wait for long.
Right kind of mood to have a cold drink.
What would you have?
"Limca, thumsup, or orange..."
You want to tell me something?
- Sory...?
"Oh... yes, I want to tell you something."
"You see, Miss Sheetal, I want to clear something with you."
So that there won't be any misunderstanding in future.
"Ifyou think, I am just putting on a show, but I love you vey much... lfyou think so, then let me tell you that you are right."
But...
I never thought that...
"Look Sheetal, don't tell me that you don't like me or love me."
I am a police officer. I promptly catch a person who tells a lie.
If I am not wrong...
did you say you love me?
But you are behaving as ifyou are giving me a speeding ticket.
Surely there are other ways too to express your love?
Indeed.
But they are worn out and outdated.
So I thought I'd ty a new style.
To help me succeed.
"Vijay, ifyou think you'll succeed because ofthe novelty then you are right."
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
"""Our friendship has blossomed into love"""
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
"How could I forget that you're going out... with the ""cover girl""?"
Everyone else is orgasmic... that you're going out with her.
"- Good, because I just wanted to..."
"- Don't worry about it, Paul."
- It's good to keep things open.
- That's what I...
Here.
There are many more where these came from.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was just wrapping this up... so I can go to Carl's photo book party.
"I'll send Carls your best, because you're not going."
You have a very important project to do.
Have you noticed people's desks lately?
Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors... since Todd Oldham's debut collection.
It's all about black.
"What it this bullshit, anyway?"
This is not Lucky Charm cereal.
"This is not ""Oz""."
"This is not ""Skills""."
I want you to replace each and every one... of these hideous five-a-dime acessories immediately.
Everybody's desks should be in ship-shape by tomorrow morning.
Philip's just messengered over his new line of desk acessories.
"From now on, everything should be black."
Those bitches... they all said:
"""Brown is the new black""."
"I got news for you, baby:"
Black... could kick brown's ass.
"Jocelyn, what are you doing working so late?"
I'm making the bulletin boards clash-proof.
God forbid we have a stray yellow damn tag!
- I'm so sorry!
- I know.
I'm used to it.
- Now listen.
- Red fuck!
We need help.
Somebody has been stealing our story ideas and trading them...
"- to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue."
"- I know all about it, pussy."
- Do you know who it is?
- We're not gonna do it that way.
"First, you're going to tell me what you know and I'm gonna"
- tell you if you're right.
"- I have a sneaking suspicion... it could be Pierre Larroux, our make-up artist."
Look deeper.
Look closer.
Follow the fashion!
What do you mean?
They are brilliant!
Did you design them?
No.
I have to give credit where credit's due.
- Sebastian designed them.
"- Yes, darling, you do know... that I have a better grasp on the subject than he."
"It's time to pile into the town cars and you can check the list... for what booths you're assigned to, and the times."
"And remember... when you're not in the booths, you're still representing Skirt."
I wish I could always have a cock this big this close to my face.
- You are disgusting!
- Actually... my room service boy in Paris... wasn't so different from the dimensions on this shirt
You should see him serve more than a petit dejanuai.
You chaseabout!
What did you have on your customs card... when you came back:
Business or pleasure?
I'm sorry.
I thought this office was vacant.
I'm Kitty Pimms.
I've just been hired.
- By whom?
- Woolsey Nicholls.
Woolsey?
So you're replacing Kentucky?
A little soon after her death.
"Seems distasteful, don't you think?"
"It does, but it also speaks to the efficiency of your Human Resources department."
- Mm-hm.
I wonder how else you'll be replacing Kentucky.
Since I'm a withered hag tattered by every grain in the hourglass Betty's Bees still needs a fresh face.
"And after what happened, well no one wants to think about that when they're buying lip balm."
Welcome to Betty's Bees.
Kentucky's affairs were clearly a bee in Betty Bee's bonnet.
"Oh, I just wanted to say what an honor it is to be working with you..."
Thank you.
Get out.
And so Chuck got out.
But the question remained:
Betty Bee:
Coconspirator or killer?
"Kentucky was the new face of Betty's, which does give Betty motive."
Being replaced by better-looking always gives you motive.
"But Kentucky was sabotaging Betty's Bees, trademark which was owned by Woolsey, which gives Woolsey motive."
Woolsey's a businessman.
"Somebody sabotage him he'd send in a swarm of lawyers, not bees."
I know.
They were lovers of the same-sex persuasion and the key is for their love nest.
We've ruled out workplace romance.
"I want to introduce you to the First Daughter of the United States, my daughter Catherine Selina Meyer."
Catherine.
Always a delight to have...
She is such a beautiful girl.
I'm so proud of her.
"Well, we have another minute or so before we're prepared to call Virginia."
Just checking a couple of precincts.
We've made some premature calls this evening.
So we're anxious to be absolutely certain this time.
Why don't we meet some of the people who lift me up?
I'd like you to meet them.
"Guys, come on out."
How about these great faces?
Incredible scenes.
Never happened before.
Very emotional moment.
"Dan, do you wish you were there?"
I'm sure it's a very exciting place to be at.
There's never been an election like this.
No.
You must want to be there.
"Folks, you don't know her, but this is Karen Collins."
And she has been a friend of mine for a while.
Yep.
And Amy Brookheimer is here.
Amy Brookheimer who so successfully ran my campaign until she became unwell.
I'll tell you somebody else that is not here tonight who was with the campaign...
"Sounds like it could be you, Dan."
"Well, I would be incredibly touched."
"And that is, of course, Leslie Kerr."
"I'm sure Leslie is thanking you, too."
And I'm hearing we can now project a Virginia result.
"Death that has killed my daughter, ties my tongue and drains my eyes and will not let me grieve."
"Oh, child."
My soul more than my child.
Dead are you now.
Alack.
"My child is dead... and with my child, all my joys are buried."
"Oh, come, sir, for shame."
"And think of her poor soul, freed now from care and safe in heaven's bliss."
Give up your grief and bring sweet-smelling flowers to lay upon her corpse with gentle tears.
"Then take her to church, where she may sleep among her kin for all eternity."
The plans we made for joyful celebration must turn instead to mark our sorrowing woe.
Our merry hymns to sullen dirges change.
"Sir, madam, make ready for our march, to take this lovely child to her grave."
We cannot know why it is heaven's will.
But we must trust in him who orders all.
Stop!
"I beseech you, sir."
In heaven's name.
"Say now, are you a holy man of God?"
"I am a novice, but I serve God, yes."
Have you made study in the art of herbs?
- I have.
- My son is sick.
I have an errand to perform in Mantua.
- By when?
- Before tonight.
Mantua is but two leagues away.
I'll take you there myself.
Then show me your child.
"Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No, thank you, Jack."
- Cousin.
They waltz into my court.
"They get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend."
The only treatment for them is death.
You dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.
Tough to get a conviction without a body.
There's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand.
I saw them.
They were there with his name on my son's computer.
"Your son, Kyle sent them."
To himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
He blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
Sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
He wanted to get the coach fired.
This whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.
Wrestle!
You got him!

"You going somewhere, Don?"
"Yep, there is no point in me hanging around pushing papers."
"It's not my style, Mac."
You've been cleared.
I just heard.
"- I want you to know, I never doubted you."
- Thanks.
"You know, for a long minute there, it felt like everybody else did."
Todd Fleming's medical records show that he was prescribed an anti-depressant eight months ago.

"Ma, nothing to worry about."
I spent the day sitting on a rooftop playing sudoku on my phone.
- You can do that?
I need a new phone.
- Yeah.
"I got to go, mom."
Call you later.
"Well, well, well."
I heard you took a bullet.
Do you know how pissed I am that I wasn't there to see that?
"Bunch of us are dropping by the cove, try and wipe the day away."
You gonna come?
Nah.
The thing about a drink after the battle is you got to be in the battle.
"So I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and play the most violent video game I can find."
- Later.
- Later.
"Hey, I'm glad you're not dead, butt-head."
Me too.
"The rampage left 12 dead, 23 wounded, and many still in critical condition."
"The alledged gunman, a former I.T. advisor at the company, was evidently embittered over being recently let go"
Due to company downsizing.
He apparently entered the building... that was insane.
"Yes, Glenn."
A man walking into a building and shooting people in the head is the definition of insane.
They give you a nickname over at the station yet?
"We'll call you ""dictionary."" You walking around here defining things."
"I'm just dicking with you, man."
That was a thick one out there.
"You think that was insane, shoulda been at Katrina."
"- Oh, no?"
- No.
- Then you lured me here...
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
"- How do you see this playing, then?"
- You tell me.
I won't go through that routine next time you run away.
Then why did you this time?
"Oh, you know I'm always curious as far as you're concerned."
- You wanted to go back to prison.
- Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
"They're not good, to be honest."
"And of course, that kind of decision has an effect on others."
"You and your sister - you were separated when your parents died, weren't you?"
You entered the chaos of the care system and Jess went to live with Aunt and Uncle.

"Robert and Abi, though, they seem contented little kids."
"I'm sure they'd rather be together, with your sister."
Is he fast?
Cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he takes a couple of steps.
"I would, too."
"That's partly the reason you're here, isn't it?"
- right. hmm.
"well, it's been a pleasure."
- oh. thank you.
"so, we cool here?"
"- based on my evaluation, you don't meet the minimum requirements for the department of child care."
- what?
what does that mean?
- we'll be in touch.
- let me see that.
- that is confidential!
- you still got to take me to town.

- oh.
what kind of a person doesn't want their own mother to be with their kids?
!
"- cindy, you don't deserve those kids."
you need to take a good long look at yourself.
you rely on everybody to do things for you.
"you know, your kids don't even expect christmas presents this year from you because they know that, if you had one cent, you'd spend it on yourself, or you'd put it in some stupid scheme that doesn't pay off."
(Clinks and whooshes)
(Cheering and laughing)
What are we gonna do now?
I'll think of something.
- What's funny?
- Russ didn't tell you?
"He told me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
- He didn't tell you about Pete?
"- No, who's Pete?"
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible cause he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
- What did he do?
- He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe, because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while he hear a voice inside that said: ""Pete, don't worry about it."""
You weren't the first licensed practitioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then, just when he almost over the guilt with it all, another voice would bring him back down to reality."
"And say: ""Oh Pete,"
But dude...
"You're a Veterinarian."""
Vi!
Let's go!
Wha..
What are you doing?
- I don't get it.
- Don't get what?
What's so funny about a vegetarian man?
I don't get it.
So I don't have to send him down the mines quite yet?
"Um, I'm sorry, I think that might be my next appointment."
"No, that is your previous one."
That's Fuzz's dad who's just successfully missed every other parent-teacher interview.
"Cleaver, this is Fiona McCready, Fuzz's English teacher."
Hi.
Sorry.
Caught up in a very complex trial.
"Oh, was the complex trial run over five or eight furlongs?"
Finnegan mentioned you were a barrister.
I think he wants to follow in your footsteps.
"According to all the other teachers, he is."
"What is an education, anyway?"
I spent most of 1982 learning 52.8% of Malaysia's GDP came from rubber.
I don't even know if they produce the stuff anymore.
"He's a bright boy, he's falling behind."
Why?
"Because he doesn't sit up straight in class and say,"
"'Miss, Miss, ask me!"
'
You know what happens to kids who do that.
"Yes, they're in an office somewhere with their hand up still."
"Anyway, that last teacher seemed quite impressed."
"Yes, she did."
Yeah.
Never had a teacher who looked like that.
I did once see Miss Treadwell in her bathers.
Her varicose veins looked like an aerial shot of the Nile Delta.
(Laughs)
Is there a word that means even shallower than superficial?
Are you still screwing Scarlet?
I knew it was a mistake telling you.
[slam] [phone rings]
Hello.
"Oh, Paul."
How's the party?
It died.
So did the hostess.
What do you mean?
"Well, somebody stole the family jewels after all and slipped a knife into Mrs. Langley at the same time."
"Perry, could you come over right away?"
"My responsibility here is to the niece Merle, and the way things are shaping up, the poor kid's going to need help fast."
What kind of help?
"Well, right now, the case depends on who's got those diamonds, which is like looking for a needle in a haystack because this place is enormous."
But there's one place the police haven't looked--
Merle's luggage.
Why not?
They can't find the keys.
"Paul, do you have the keys?"
You guessed it.
Merle slipped them to me with a pleading look.
"Perry, I'd appreciate it if you were here when Lieutenant Anderson forces the locks."
"Okay, Sergeant, thank you very much."
"All right, no one left the party early."
No one has those diamonds in their possession.
So we're starting to search the grounds now and that other house across the way.
Without a search warrant?
"We didn't think you'd mind, Mr. Kirk."
"No, no."
Anytime.
"But in the meantime, this luggage."
"Miss Telford, have you remembered yet what you did with the keys?"
"I lost them, I told you."
Then I'm afraid we'll have to force the--
If they hope to continue Their hunt at sledge.
Rock and rock And rock and rock.
"If you don't find any gold,"
You can't call yourself a Miner.
"So if I can't find Anything new,"
Then there's no reason To keep doing this.
125 miles east...
Right now it's gonna tell us Whether we've wasted our time.
Or if we've made a good Decision And we're gonna get rich.
Fuel is back in the air pump.
And shawn is ready once more...
To hunt for elusive gold At the bluff.
I got a reputation to uphold.
"I come out here and fail, I'm gonna look like a fool."
I don't like failing.
Each expedition At the bluff costs thousands.
"And if shawn fails again,"
His plan for the empire Will be on it's last leg.
I'm here because I have a feeling.
That there's a lot of gold Here.
I just have a feeling.
My gut tells me That I'm gonna find.
Some nice big chunks Of gold today.
"I mean, I've been to the bluff Multiple times and failed."
"But every time you go back,"
You're hoping You're gonna succeed.
You got to always stay Positive.
"Ooh, here we go."
Do or die.
Here we go.
"I think we're gonna find Something really,"
Really good down here.
That's right.
Spotters never raise the bet or play any kind of progressive system.
"That's how we stay under the radar, and that's why we never get caught."
Exactly.
"Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min, and they're keeping the count waiting for one of these decks to get hot."
Right.
"And then when one of the decks gets hot, the spotter at that table signals in the big player."
This...
Mustard.
"Give me the mustard, honey."
Please.
"Well, I'm always the mustard, so..."
"When I get the signal for the hot deck, I stumble over like some drunk rich kid, or some zoned out dot-com millionaire, and I throw down big money."
So the big player bets big and still keeps the count.
"When the deck cools, he cashes in."
It's not as easy as it sounds.
"Oh, yeah, it's not, you know, because if Grey Poupon over here ever loses the count, it's up to his table's spotter to give him the signal to get out."
"- And you know the signals, right?"
- Yeah.
Show us.
"Okay, what's this?"
- The deck's hot.
- Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out.
Get out now.
Good.
I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
- Where?
- You'll find out.
- All right.
All right.
"Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?"
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive.
That's really good.
"I mean, I'm very impressed by that, especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations."
"All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know."
Anyone?
Bueller.
Anyone?
Bueller.
Newton stole it.
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
"And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails."
"- I'm sorry, what's your name?"
- Ben.
Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson was the original author of this method.
"Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?"
"Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist."
"And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna."
"All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?"
"We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?"
"Ben, suppose you're on a game show."
"And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?"
"Now, behind one of the doors is a new car."
"Behind the other two, goats."
"Which door would you choose, Ben?"
25 miles west of nome.
Off sledge island...
"- hey, zeke, you copy?"
"- Yes, I copy."
I'm gonna crawl down The hose here.
"After narrowly Escaping the bends,"
"Zeke tenhoff is Down under once again,"
This time in shallower waters.
It would be really encouraging.
Just to see one little Micro flyspeck of gold.
It's been a while Since I've seen one.
But the team is still Coming up empty handed.
I don't want to think Of what's gonna happen.
If we don't succeed In making money at all.
This is really Our very last chance.
To make a future for ourselves.
What is this place?
Good god.
"I can see some rocks down here,"
A lot of big old boulders.
"Well, um, I mean I think we Just have to keep looking, man."
"Well, um, looks like there's Some pockets of gravel."
In between some of these rocks I haven't tried dredging on.
Where is the gold?
I miss gold so much.
I didn't realize how Emotionally Dependent I am on gold.
Kind of does look like It might be bedrock.
So it's a bunch of boulders On top of bedrock.
"If there's gold here, We're just gonna have to."
Keep hunting around Everywhere to find it.
"You know, I think I just want to lift up."
"One of these boulders and see Maybe underneath the boulder,"
- Enough for all the ladies who do high tea at the Bel-Air.
"Yeah, I remember my first campaign."
I didn't care about image.
I would show up at a fundraiser in the same suit that I wore to the previous night's fundraiser.
"Sometimes my wife and I would bring the kids,"
- strapped to us in those backpacks.
- Sounds like fun.
"No, it was, and then we'd rush home, put the kids to bed and then stay up all night laughing about the evening."
Sounds like you and your wife made a good team.
Ex-wife.
"And, yeah, we did."
For a while.
Do you miss her?
I miss the people we were back then.
"And no, I don't miss who she is now."
And I know she doesn't miss who I've become.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language' Ha'

"And when was this, sir?"
12 years ago.
And you believe that woman is Sara Collins?
"Yeah, I do."
"Your name, sir?"
Peter Manning.
M-A-N-N-I-N-G.
27 hours.
I got two calls from the director's office.
He's got half of Capitol Hill breathing down his neck.
Yeah?
"Well, if they want to do something constructive for a change, give them a badge and let them help."
I'll put that in the suggestion box.
We got the DNA back on these hairs we found in Jessica Nevins' hotel room.
They're Sara's.
Pulled out by the root.
Is there enough to issue a warrant for Miss Nevins?
No.
"But we're monitoring her credit card accounts, all her known acquaintances."
"She sticks her head out of the rabbit hole, we got her."
And Amanda McNeal:
Where are we at with the prelim?
Body's still frozen.
M.E. can't autopsy until it thaws out.
"Guys, Dockery's got something."
Surveillance footage from the Biltmore garage four minutes after Sara disappeared.
There's our Taurus.
And there's Valera.
"Sara's probably tied up in the backseat, maybe the trunk."
"All right, I want subpoenas for every exterior surveillance camera in downtown Atlanta-- security cams, traffic cams, weather cams,"
"Convenience stores, ATMs."
"And you can wake up every judge in town, if you have to."
Named her Fen for the record.
Check for yourself.
And she's happy where she is.
I very much doubt that.
There's no force the way I handle her.
She's content as long as she gets fed.
So no law broken.
See for yourself.
I've nothing to hide.
Do you know this man?
Never clapped eyes on him.
I had to stop myself from throttling the man who keeps her.
I had neither the ability to arrest him or to rescue her.
She is his legal property.
That's appalling!
"A man is allowed to exhibit a young girl in a cage, and there's nothing I can do about it."
(Julia sighing)
What of our victim's body?
"His wounds were mostly superficial, the most pronounced being facial lacerations."
"He was gouged, likely by claws or nails."
And this.
A deep bite on his right hand.
The wounds were made with pointed incisor teeth.
So likely an animal attack then?
That would have been my conclusion if not for the stab wound in his upper back.
"The thrust was a downward motion, but not a fatal blow."
- Then how did he die?
- He bled to death.
"If he hadn't been trapped, he may have survived."
What time would he have been stabbed?
I couldn't say.
I only know that he died between 2 and 4 in the morning.
You said you wanted to meet him.
Besides we just got here.
Why don't you leave me alone?
"My uncle, who you saw in passing, raised me because both of my parents were killed in a car accident."
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to contextualize my sadness.
Put whatever you're going through into perspective.
My mom was pregnant at the time.
Seven months.
I was on the news.
"I'm telling you this to hurt you right now, because you're trying to make me feel bad, horrible even, which I don't appreciate."
But I never will...
Because nothing ever feels bad once you learn what that emotion is capable of.
Now let's not make a big deal about it.
I usually don't...
But you really forced my hand on this.
Do you know that expression?
"""Forced my hand""?"
It's one of my favorites.
She seems difficult.
She is.
Very.
"Well, you're putting her in an ugly situation."
What with you trying to have two girlfriends.
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.
(IKE CHUCKLES)
You have one living in a house that you share with her in the city and another one up here that you're living with.
"Yeah, I can see the appeal."
I practically invented it.
But I did it better than you.
Nobody hated me then.
I could enjoy it.
"Well, he called the other day, sir."
He asked for President Harding.
[Laughing]
- We can have a national prayer day.
"- Never complain, never explain."
"Come on, these are not fraternity pranks, John."
"No, this is anarchy."
It's a revolution.
"- I wouldn't go thatfar, sir."
- Why not?
"Is itworth it, sir?"
I mean...
Is the warworth a one-term presidency?
Because that's whatwe're looking at.
I will not go down as the first American presidentto lose a war.
"Going to Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos, buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance."
"- Exactly, sir."
"- Lfwe keep our heads, we'll win."
"- What, win Vietnam, sir?"
"- No, no."
"No, butwe can drive a stake through the heartofthe Communist alliance."
Henry's getting strong signals from the Chinese.
They fearthe Vietnamese more than the Russians... and they're worried abouta united Vietnam.
"Now, ifwe stick itout, we'll end up negotiating separately... with both the Chinese and the Soviets."
And we'll get better deals than we ever dreamed offrom both.
"That is triangular diplomacy, gentlemen."
"Exactly, Mr. President."
That's what geopolitics is about.
The linking ofthe whole world for self-interest.
"Ron, how I can explain that on TV to a bunch ofsimpleminded reporters... and, uh, weeping mothers."
"Yeah, butwhat am I telling the press about Kent State?"
"Ah, tell 'em whatthe hellyou like."
Good luck!
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
Angel...
"You have been blaming yourself all this time, haven't you?"
"In this world, there's no one who blames you."
Every single one of you say you don't blame me.
"But, in private, you say that Mom's death is my fault!"
"Back then, I was opposed to having the baby."
Lily was right at the peak of her career...
"At that time, she was at the prime of her modeling years."
"I can't believe that for her child, Lily was willing to sacrifice everything."
"In the end, because of a child's request, she dropped all her work, and specially flew back in order to celebrate her birthday."
"Mary, you're up."
Give Auntie a hug.
Come...
"Daddy, Mommy died because of me."
Didn't she?
Of course not.
"Why would you think that, Mary?"
Let's go.
I'll take you to get something to eat.
You can't trust what adults say.
That's not how it is at all.
Don't have such foolish thoughts.
That's definitely how it is!
That's definitely how it is!
"Even now, Dad still hates me!"
"At this time, in the script..."
Lola appears.
"She cannot hold back the tears, but gently laughs once."
Why is it disdainful laughter?
Can we do this later please ?
"Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams."
I'll give my deployment orders through sergeant...
Deployment orders ?
Fire teams ?
"Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before."
"Well, you've supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers."
"No, we were guerilla fighters."
All right ?
Hit and run.
"Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance."
I've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a whole different game.
"You're just gonna have to learn it fast, because that's what we're doing."
We're defending this fixed position.
Until chief finds his eye of Jupiter.
"Okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you haven't even found yet ?"
!
"Listen, Sam, I'm not even sure it exists."
But I don't have to tell you every little godsdamn detail.
You know what you have to explain to me ?
"The major's in charge on this one, okay ?"
Okay ?
"Well, I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your major."
"In my thought, that went really well."
- He'll do it.
- He'd better.
I miss Nicky.
- Do you think he's okay ?
"- Yes, he's fine."
- He's on Galactica.
He's fine.
!
-Quick carry her inside!
-Yes.
"Are you alright, Priestess Yeo Mi-Eul?"
We thought we were going to lose you.
I'm okay.
You've exhausted yourself.
How's things in the palace?
"About the reinforcements,"
His Majesty hasn't come to a decision yet.
The ministers have differing opinions among themselves too.
It looks like His Majesty is having a hard time.
"It's just a yes or a no, must it take so long?"
As long as you agree to it.
BuYeo will receive the Emperor's benevolence.
I simply cannot understand all this dragging and procrastination.
"Prince Dae-So, please try again."
"If I try again, it'll only make it worse."
I cannot wait any longer!
"If you cannot decide soon, then it leaves me no choice."
What's that supposed to mean?
Haven't I made myself clear enough?
It's because of Prince Dae-So's hardwork that our nations... have the peace that they enjoy now.
"This has nothing to do with the reinforcements,"
It was solely between you and me.
Don't try to put them together.
I'm very touched that you brought me Hae Mo-Su's head.
"Concerning BuYeo and the Han Dynasty's diplomacy,"
I'm very interested in helping you out.
"But,"
"If you're holding back because you fear your father,"
Then it's a pity our friendship has to end here.
"That's what I say too, but you don't believe me."
"You're just lying to yourself, aren't you?"
You'll never know for sure whether your dad really wrote those messages.
I know!
I just know!
What's going on here?
Will the show continue?
Don't know...
You just know?
What basis do you have for saying you know?
Do you think you know your dad very well?
Back to the script.
Gong Xi is going back to Lola's lines.
She's acting again.
Yes.
She's back to Lola's lines again.
You've never had a proper conversation with your dad.
"All day and night, you just complain that Dad doesn't care about you."
You never try to be understanding of his feelings.
Isn't that true?
"Mary, how was your day at school?"
Did you play any fun games with your classmates?
Why does he ask the same question every time?
Lame.
"Bit nippy, but this time of year, what do you expect?"
"And as your daughter said, no-one really knows what's gonna happen."
You don't have to do this any more.
You can live instead.
Daddy!
You've been found guilty by a unanimous verdict.
"The law says you should be punished, but we don't have the resources to impose a custodial sentence."
"Therefore, I have no choice but to pass a sentence of death."
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself,under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites,the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"- Were you scared,Mr.Petty?"
"- No,ma'am."
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know,Mr.Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water,where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right,Mr.Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea,Mr.Madsen?"
"If you know,why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring,right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well,you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
That you need it.
"Yeah, well, that's not why I'm doing this."
You sure about that?
"Tell yourself whatever you want, but going into the police station is a suicide mission."
Yeah.
"Be careful, Isaac, 'cause it almost sounds like you care."
Eric?
Jadalla... police found three bodies near the train yards.
"From the description, it sounds like Malik and his team."
"What about their targets, Carter and Grimes?"
Two men were seen fleeing the area.
They could be anywhere by now.
Keep monitoring police networks.
Find Carter and Grimes.
The Americans probably have the list by now.
"Your operation's failed, Jad."
You failed.
So what are you saying...
We should go back home?
"No, we have men and weapons."
"We move now, pick a target and launch our own attack."
We're here to finish what my father started.
"I respect you as his son, but you're not a soldier like him."
Your father fought the enemy from caves while you were studying at oxford.
But I am here now like my father always wanted.
You've told me you loved my father like a brother.
Prove it now.
Help me get the list and launch the sleeper cells.
Hey.
Mr. Harris called me into his office.
He wanted to talk to me before he went to the principal.
"I had to tell him about the text, okay, I had no choice."
"Somehow her energy, her essence..."
Even they weren't sure how it happened.
"Wouldn't it have been nice, Leena, if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them?"
"Lot of loose ends here, okay?"
So I'm not...
"That is why, Claudia, taking inventory is so important!"
So what are we saying?
What are we saying?
Are we saying that just Myka's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice?
"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying."
Looks like Myka.
Isn't Myka.
"And if we give voice to that thing, it'll trick us somehow to try to get out and that is not gonna happen."
We've done enough.
We promised each other we'd stop at $5 million.
"I'm a lying, convicted thief, Gary."
I'm breaking the promise.
"No, we're so close."
We're just a few thousand away.
It won't make any difference.
You need to see a doctor.
We don't have any insurance.
Please.
We'll be paying out of pocket.
I won't go unless we offset what that'll cost with an hour's worth of betting.
- Listen to yourself.
- You listen.
My hand can rot off.
I'm not going to any doctor.
We should take it now.
Take what?
Whatever it is they've got.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your Sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
"There was a meeting between the D.O.D. And Lockheed... in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 23."
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
Anything relevant they have from that date I want.
Tell them it's for Stan Beeman... and I have code-word clearance for the project.
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"[Gaad] Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect a call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want... and you wind up..."
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the K.G.B. Right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony... before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
I can write my essay later.
"Whatever it is, I'm in."
Wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
"If you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously."
Then let me drive the getaway car instead.
Or I could create a diversion or something.
"Hey, you want in?"
Accept the assignment.
Then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
What can I do to help?
Help what?
Help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
How do you know what we've been talking about?
You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
Could you make out with Amanda?
'Cause that would be hot.
It's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
"Number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence."
"That's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy."
"Bitchy, not cynical."
A total difference.
I was just trying to help.
?
Can I help you?
Hi.
Is Amanda home?
I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
"Because every time we chase down a bad guy on foot, you drive."
Ah.
"Well, I am kind of a genius that way."
- Who's the hottie on deck?
- He's cute.
"- Our latest client, and he's engaged."
- Of course he is.
"Charlie, we're all here."
"- Morning, angels."
"- Good morning, Charlie."
I'd like you to meet Scott Foster.
He's here because his fiancee disappeared off a cruise ship.
It was supposed to be a 3-day trip.
Miami to the Bahamas.
That was two weeks ago.
Your fiancee went on a cruise without you?
She's working a story.
She's a journalist.
- And what was she chasing on the high seas?
- She never talks about her work.
"The cruise line registers their ships in the Bahamas, which puts this case out of American jurisdiction."
Cruise line give you any leads?
"They've been incredibly helpful, but the fact is, they don't have any answers, and there's no evidence of foul play aboard their ship."
"If she's alive, I need to find her, and if she's not- let's just stay positive."
Right now she's just a missing person.
"Scott, before we take your case, there is one last piece of business we need to settle internally."
You'll hear from us.
Thank you.
"All right, we'll walk you out."
Right this way.
Internal business?
"Charlie, don't leave us hanging."
- I hope you'll let me stay with you.
- Sure.
Go and eat something first.
Good idea.
Let's go.
"Now, let's talk about you."
"Go on, tell me what happened."
What do you think happened?
The usual.
It wasn't pleasant.
"Listen, I know from a reliable source when and where Ramírez's plane is going to land."
We've been waiting for something like this.
- We'd have no problems at the airport?
"- No, I'll deal with that."
The place will be teeming with soldiers.
We'll never get close to Ramírez.
"You're not planning to shoot down that aeroplane, are you?"
- What else can we do?
- You want to kill all those innocent people?
I don't want to fight for our cause in that way.
"If we do something like that, we're no different from them."
The other passengers are as bad as Ramírez.
But they're not fighting the world.
"I agree, but sometimes you're forced to do things you abhor."
It's either the death of a few innocent men or the suffering of a whole people.
Hold on a second.
The whole thing might be a large-scale trap.
That's a risk we must take.
There will only be three of us.
I'll take Smithy and Hidalgo with me.
We'll meet just before the operation.
Any questions?
"We need our ""A"" game, people."
Now we all know Mystique has a perfect inspection record to uphold.
"So, yes, I'm talking about a sanitary food preparation environment."
But I'm also talking about something bigger.
I'm talking about pride.
"Okay, on to the walk-in."
Let's monitor those cold-holding temperatures.
Thanks for coming.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
It's freezing.
"What do you guys got the A.C. On, high?"
That's part of the problem.
"Yeah, take a look at this."
"[Shudders] Got the heater turned all the way up, but..."
But still this ungodly chill.
"With all due respect, Mr. And Mrs. Burke, just because your thermostat's broken doesn't mean that there's a ghost in your suite."
It's not just the thermostat.
"The last few nights, the lights, the TV, they turn on and off without us doing anything."
We haven't slept a wink.
I knew it was a mistake to buy this place furnished.
[Mrs. Burke] It's spooky.
It's like her presence is still here.
"Look, uh..."
[Clears Throat]
I know there's probably a logical explanation for all this.
"But my wife, she's a little superstitious, you understand."
Of course.
Of course.
"Well, lucky for you my friend Mike here is an expert at this stuff."
"Mike, you wanna take a look at the thermostat?"
I'll call Maintenance.
- Treat me as you would a stranger.
"As for you, Mr. Buff um, it might be wiser if you didn't speak at all."
I never met a Kentuckian so plainly from Massachusetts.
[thunder]
Do you have your pistols?
Keep them hidden.
"In this business, you never fight unless you've failed, and we won't fail."
Nothing can stop us.
[thunder]
Nothing.
[Pittenger] Andrews gave us 3 days for our journey through the Cumberlands.
"Traveling by twos and threes, we were strung out miles apart in a desolate country."
"We'd been supplied with Confederate money, but food and lodging were scarce, and transportation out of the question."
"My companion was the Giant, Bill Campbell."
"As I came to know him, I felt a growing concern over his quick, violent temper."
One such powder keg could blow our whole expedition sky-high.
"We reached the Tennessee River on time, only to find it impassable."
"Pardon me, ma'am."
Do you know the whereabouts of the ferryman?
"Home, like enough."
But he won't chance it across before morning.
River's swole up mighty angry.
- Could you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?
"[Pittenger] Flemingsburg, Kentucky."
Inn's pretty full.
We can pay double.
[thunder]
"They're from Flemingsburg, too."
There's a score of us in all.
We couldn't abide the Yankees anymore so we pulled up stakes.
Gonna throw in our lot with the Southern army.
# Go with the status quo #
# Go with the status # # 'cause that's where we should go... #
It says this D.V.D. sold more copies than any D.V.D. ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out, guys."
"If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done."
I no longer have any connection to this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good-bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes,"
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it either-
- Kenny?
No fucking way I'm doing it.
"All right, we promise?"
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
- I swear.
- I swear too.
"Okay, good."
"What happened, I thought you were gonna kill yourself."
I tried.
Went to sleep in my Mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
But you didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and the democratic west side.
# East side west side #
# Whatever side that you're on #
# As long as we care about each other #
# We can still all have some fun... #
Not a stick nor a spar.
"Looks like we're on our own, then."
What happened to them?
Where are they?
They must have sailed.
"If there are no British ships, there will be French ones."
We should go.
- We will.
- Back to Gibraltar as I suggested?
"- Bring her about, Mr. Scott-Padget."
"- Yes, sir."
"Boatswain, stand by to wear ship!"
Mr. Ponsonby I want you to send Crawford into the tops for two days.
"For punishment, sir?"
Do as I tell you.
I wish to speak to the ship's company informally.
"Muster all hands, if you please."
- All hands to the after well deck!
- Come on!
Jump to it!
Are we heading back to Gibraltar?
We'll stay on this course for the time being.
"Well, lads, I've got some explaining to do."
We seemed to have lost the fleet.
I want you to know the orders for the fleet and for us which are to escort a convoy of timber ships from the far side of Italy back to England.
"Timber to build ships of the line, and frigates."
More like her.
Defiant.
We must go to the place of rendezvous and see if the convoy is there.
"If it isn't, well, we tried."
"If it is, we'll bring it back in the face of Frenchmen, Spaniards or anyone else who tries to stop us."
- Back to your duties.
One of Sam's whales won 300 grand at a private table.
And he's back at it today.
But I checked the tape and everything's on the up-and-up.
Just one of those runs.
Right.
Look.
"I don't want Monica finding out about these phony chips, all right?"
She owns the place.
Kinda hard to keep her out of the loop.
"Unless she's preoccupied with some other major crisis like, uh, this dealer who can't seem to deal a losing hand."
"I'm just afraid, Mike, that if she finds out about it, the wrong heads can roll."
You know?
Like mine?
I don't want the cops involved.
Not yet anyway.
Not until we get our money back.
- Mr. Deline.
"- How are you, Sarasvati?"
Good.
They told me you needed to see me right away.
Right.
"The, um, daily revenue reports, when are they scheduled to go out?"
"An hour or so, but if you need it sooner-"
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I'd like the distribution delayed till I tell you."
"Mr. Deline, under normal circumstances,"
"I would gladly accommodate your request, but Miss Mancuso had already requested-"
You just tell Miss Mancuso that it was my decision.
We don't want her to find out about the counterfeit chips.
Oh.
It's very hard for me to be duplicitous.
Which is why we love you.
Our Emperor wishes to give you a chance to serve the Han.
"He requests you send 1 0,000 soldiers."
This is an opportunity to show your allegiance... and restore our estranged friendship.
We know what His Majesty is like.
He'll never send reinforcements.
I agree.
But he still hasn't given an answer.
He usually does immediately.
Maybe he has different plans.
"(Jinyong, Tax Minister) I doubt it."
It's probably because of the recent trade issue.
He's worried refusing the demand might lead to another salt scare.
- Chief General.
- Yes?
"Can we afford to send 1 0,000 soldiers?"
Not from the city and the borders... but there will be no problem if we send the Sachooldo soldiers.
"(Heukchi, Chief General) The King knows that."
Prime Minister.
What can we gain from sending reinforcements?
It could solve the trade issue.
We could even demand steel weapons.
Why don't we demand they arm our men and pay for their expenditures?
"(Bulgae, Court Minister) That's a great idea."
But I doubt they will comply.
We must wonder... whether the Han can win the war as Yangjung says they will.
We mustn't send men to a losing battle.
Did you check up on them?
Yes.
The subjects are still discussing whether they should comply or not.
They can discuss all they want but isn't it up to King Kumwa?
- Dongsun.
"- Yes, Governor."
"You shouldn't feel bad about that because, people will thank you."
- H i Brian.
- What?
"You know I was thinking, this whole thing with the gun and all..."
it would really make an important article for the paper.
"So, I was thinking that you and I should do an interview sometime."
"You know, just to let people know what really happened."
Maybe sometime after school.
What do you think?
What?
See you later.
Has the threat of violence changed the quality of my life at school?
"No, not really."
What do you mean?
I just don't see the point in talking about it.
Sometimes talking itself makes people feel better.
And sometimes talking gets people into trouble.
People say things about people and it doesn't always mean it's true.
You mean about who might be carrying a gun?
- About anything.
- Any weapon?
No.
J ust about anything anybody says about people.
It's not always true.
I just think people want to believe things about people...
so they decide certain things are true and they don't even ask.
And it's not fair.
Because you have to live with it anyway.
"But if it's not true the person could always say that, couldn't they?"
I think if something is false...
people aren't going to keep on believing it.
Usually people latch on to things when there is a kernel of truth.
"Up to now, all I really found are things."
"Wonderful things, sir?"
Yes.
But nothing written.
No papyrus.
"If I went to your house, walked through each room, how much would I actually learn about you just from looking at your possessions?"
"Not much, I think."
"But if I read your diary, came across some household bills, found letters that had been written to you, then, I think, I'd begin to understand who you really were."
"Well, I think my wife might have something to say about you wandering about her house and rummaging around, sir."
"Yes, I expect she might."
"Well, I'll say good night."
"Good night, sir."
(Operatic music playing)
"Evening, Carter."
"Sorry, door was unlocked."
Let myself in.
I thought you'd be here sooner.
- Helped myself to a drink.
Hope you don't mind.
- Of course not.
What can I do for you?
Why don't you pour yourself a drink first?
What's the problem?
I gather Hauser and Hall have resigned and are leaving?
"Yes, I believe so."
"With Gardiner, that makes a third of our team who've walked out."
So?
Gardiner's a personal friend of mine.
He's one of the finest brains in England.
He came here at his own expense as a personal favour to me.
"Hauser and Hall, as you well know, are here courtesy of the Metropolitan."
I had a call this morning from New York.
"It's ""maybe""."
Directive is now required.
"Jenna, stand by to feed all power through to the main drive when the force wall is down."
Ready.
"Gan, deactivate the force wall."
Deactivating.
Why?
For what reason?
Perhaps Sonheim was still trying to cover up.
Mandrian knew about him and threatened to expose him.
Or perhaps he went into the filter plant while Sonheim was sabotaging the equipment?
But why damage the filter?
What possible reason could he have for delaying the flight still further?
How bad is it?
The damage was minor.
I've got Levett working on it.
We've locked him in the storage hold.
He seems quiet enough.
Has he said anything more?
Nothing new.
"He claims he went in and found Mandrian dead, picked up the knife, that's where I came in."
He still says he didn't kill him.
I believe him.
But I saw him with a dagger in his hand!
But you didn't see him use it.
"I didn't see Mandrian die either, but I know he's dead."
I've just spent the last ten minutes in the filter plant looking for something that should be there but isn't.
The cable that was damaged carries a high energy charge.
"In order to cut it, he would need a laser knife or an insulated saw."
Neither of which were there.
"Then, somebody else was the saboteur?"
Yes.
Wish I could say the same.
Not while you're pointing a gun at me or trying to.
"Well, no, you're an invisible guy with a sword."
I think you might have the advantage over me.
My point exactly.
"So what happened to you, James?"
What happened?
"I mean, I know we had our differences"
And I know Carol... happened.
"You always had your own ideas,"
Your own objections to warehouse policy.
"But, I mean, James, James--killing people."
When did you turn into that?
"I woke up, Arthur."
Ah.
Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic's iron hand
"And your neuroses,"
I could see the world more clearly.
"Yeah, well, you know, that's a little pathetic,"
"Isn't it, James, blaming everybody else but yourself?"
I don't think you found clarity.
I don't think your ego could stand the light.
I'd love to discuss this with you at length.
You or one of your new agents.
"Lattimer and Bering, right?"
I've been observing them for some time.
"I see they have potential, but they're so raw,"
"So untrained, so corruptible."
"If you come anywhere near them, I promise you--"
"I promise you, James, that you're going to regret it."
You'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I'm alive!
"Arthur, you can still read my mind."
"Well, at least let me give you one of these whole-grain muffins."
"Oh, come on."
Think of chewing as an aerobic exercise.
Ugh... just holding this muffin is making me feel bloated.
Huh?
(munching)
"One man's trash, baby."
"One, two, three, four, their prices are low, but their morals are lower!"
"Well, once again, you're overreacting."
Overreacting gets results!
I am simply exercising my right to free speech.
"Uh-huh, and the rotten fruit?"
Visual aids.
"Hilda, I've made an appointment for you with the president of the Everything Emporium to sit down and discuss the matter, if you'd like to try the mature approach."
Fine.
I just hope I can return that cow manure.
What are the odds that the cafeteria would have the bacon cheeseburgers and chocolate sundaes on the same day?
"I know, it's like winning the lottery."
Did you misplace your entree?
No.
"I'm trying to lose weight, so I can fit in my new dress."
The dress that's going to make us a lock for King and Queen.
Good.
So we're both doing our part.
"What's yours, eating like Henry VIII?"
Don't pretend like you haven't noticed my mustache.
"Oh, I see it."
"No, that's just a shadow."
(low gurgling)
Does anyone else hear that strange buzzing sound?
Yes.
Like the low hum of an incoming B-52.
"You are strong with the force, little one."
"Thank you, master."
"Thank you, master."
Master!
Revenge.
I must have revenge.
I can sense the darkness within you.
I will teach you the ways of the dark side.
But you must prove yourself first.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
"No, I will destroy the jedi."
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
And now you shall die.
Dooku.
[Exhales]
"You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?"
"I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes."
"(Gordon) Come on, Derrick."
(Derrick) I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
"(Gordon) How long, Derrick?"
"Uh, momentarily."
One minute to go.
"(Derrick) They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time."
"(Gordon) Derrick, 30 seconds to go!"
(Announcer) Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
"(Announcer) Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?"
Ay yi yi.
- Why?
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
Well... fuck you.
Next month I am going to buy the same ones but in red.
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
"I have to be with my family and besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
"I am leaving, see you next week."
Why so fast?
Let's go please.
Damn it!
- Tamales!
- What do you have?
- Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you want a sweet one?
"I don't have more money, but if you can give me credit until next time..."
Thank you.
"A ten month old baby died of an infection caused by rat bites in Colombia,"
The baby was malnourished and the authorities are questioning the mother she says that the baby's father left her alone with four kids.
The funeral of the ten year old girl murdered by a neighbor who wanted to eat her body in Oklahoma.
The victim's family and friends were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree...
Two criminals who decapitated two policemen in Mexico have not been caught yet.
"The heads were found... outside a govemment building with a note saying ""learn to respect""."
- Hey beautiful!
"- Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Dude, you haven't done any of these yet."
I know!
But who cares?
I got all the time in the world.
"I mean, I'm only turning thirty."
Thirty?
No one's thirty.
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?
"So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs..."
Appendectomy?
Now that ain't right!
"Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia."
"Well, I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé instead of my wife tonight, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying!"
?
"Tell you what, I'll think about it."
My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
"Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either."
Dr. Cox!
Dr. Cox!
No!
Awful!
Hypnosis is a very powerful tool.
It's helped people with depression and weight loss it helped me quit smoking.
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges.
"Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best:"
"Knock her out, and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel."
I think you should do it.
Knock her out and dig.
Do it.
Dig.
Do it.
Dig.
He was a good man.
He never did anything to you.
That's a dead body.
"Now, let me see."
That's an alien craft.
That's an alien craft?
Isn't it kind of small?
"The alien craft is about the size of a dinner plate,"
Who ever told you that aliens need as much space as people?
"Well, that's really quite a world that you showed me."
You're a scientist as tall as the empire state building.
and the aliens are as big as...
Jumbo shrimp.
I've available no other world to show you.
"Well, isn't it possible that that might be a child's toy?"
And not a UFO?
"Don't worry, forget it..."
"We'll leave this fucking place, baby, and we'll go to Berlin."
I wanna sing in the night clubs.
Germans love me...
We'll be happy.
What are we gonna do with this body?
Don't worry about the body...
"I know what to do, you wanna do it right now?"
Are you sure this has something to do with the UFO?
Looks like two women just killed a man.
This is not my first encounter with the aliens.
Just watch in the long run you will see what happens there.
Why don't they call the police?
Why don't we call the police?
They don't want the police to be involved.
Why?
I always wonder about women who chase men who so obviously don't wanna get caught.
You ever ask yourself that about Gillian?
You're not being fair to her.
"Well, we heard that you hacked a statue into pieces during a rehearsal."
I don't censor myself during my creative process.
Wasn't it because Gillian got a line wrong?
I want to know why you brought me down here if I can't speak to him.
"It's been happening more often, lately, had..."
"Wait, I want to hear what my husband's saying."
"I'm afraid not, Ms. Booth."
Detective Logan's already stretching the rules having you in here at all.
But this just cruel.
And it's Mrs. Reinhardt.
"What do you say, captain?"
There's no secrets between husbands and wives.
That's correct.
No secrets.
"Actually, this is the report from the emergency room doctor who examined her."
It confirms what the police officer observed.
What doctor is she talking about?
Is this about Laura?
"No, it's the doctor who examined you in Queens."
You have no right to show him that.
No secrets.
That's what you said.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with her?
"Well, she has the same disease that killed her father and uncle."
This is a summary of their autopsies.
It describes pretty clearly the course of the disease.
How can you...
Don't show him that.
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off the Supreme Court.
Laine Hanson is attractive.
She's a looker.
The mere fact that she was a Republican means that she can't be too far to the left.
It's a perfect pedigree.
We can't get you in by convincing him you're the right man for the job.
We have to convince him that she's wrong.
"Once we do that, you're in."
"And Toliver, he's as much as told me..."
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.
You won't have to.
We have to go after her.
We have to make her wade in her own blood.
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.
- Makerowitz.
- I'm sorry.
That doesn't mean much to me.
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive bill of Mr. Makerowitz.
Private citizen wants to do their own investigation...
What exactly are you trying to find out?
"Campaign irregularities, bribes?"
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
"- Yes, it is."
But the FBI would not find anything.
All of her money is tied up in blind trusts.
"The kind of improprieties you're talking about, I think that only helps her."
"Personally, I think the nation would be relieved to know that just because she's a woman..."
Who's got to come here.
He only wants to go to bed with you.
"Nobody, nobody fucks at the club, everybody's gay."
It's you who thinks about fucking all the time.
"Your vocabulary is punctuated to two words ""Shit"" and ""Fuck""."
What do you say I should say making love instead of fucking?
So what do you think?
Is that better professor?
I think you look like a hooker.
And you act like a hooker.
You'll end up in a hospital with some horrible sexual disease.
"You don't understand, so I look like a hooker?"
So what?
You like it...
I know that you like it.
So why should I live these lies?
The way you want me to dress and behave is as a sweet housewife slave of her husband's will.
A hooker at least is independant ...nobody's victim.
"It's the only fair that I warn them, this pussy has teeth."
You're my best student.
I invested a lot of time in you.
What do you say?
We've spent most possible time in bed.
"You know, Adrian has turned you into a real mean bitch."
Every body says so.
Try to be nice.
What do you think?
Do you like this professor?
I think you look better in jeans that in a turtleneck.
"Yes, professor."
May I help you?
Yes...what side of the building do your windows face?
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say, bro-in-law!"
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, you big crazy!"
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers, but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see, and I see her brighter and more clearly than anything else in this world."
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
I'd like to start the service with a passage from Ted's dream journal.
"""Drowning."
"""Gasping for air."
"No escape."""
"Wait, is that about Vietnam?"
It's about Whole Foods.
Barney.
We are not getting married.
And those aisles are too narrow!
"But you two have to get married-- otherwise, it's just a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand."
"Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?"
Yes.
Barney... don't you see?
Your detox is done!
You're over one-night stands!
But your servant said you were meeting with the king.
So?
It was very late.
"If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake."
I know the chÃ¢teau you claim to stay at in angers
Where you ran into francis.
It burned down last year.
I don't know what happened
"Between the two of you, but I can guess,"
So please don't counsel me on mistakes.
"Come along, girls, be of service to your queen."
Girl:
"oh, my sweetest child god's smile behind your eyes in his hand, in our arms you will find no harm."
Who are you?
Why are you singing that song?
I was told to sing it near you.
By who?
I was paid by another who was paid by a girl...
I don't know who.
She's dead.
That girl is dead.
It's impossible.
The messenger who delivered the news
Of the english queen's death isn't here.
I suppose he knew he'd served his purpose
"And that your invitation was a mere courtesy,"
A thanks for giving us both what we want.
You bribed him to bear false news.
"To get the job done,"
As you failed in that task completely.
You can thank me later.
"the power of love a force from above cleaning my soul flame on, burn desire love with tongues of fire purge the soul make love your goal"
What did you find out about Kim Yang?
"Lord Dangje, the regent's father, is looking after the new governor."
Is there a reason why?
"Kim Yang is a very competent man, who has risen in the ranks very rapidly."
He was revered by the people under his rule.
Some have even built a monument in his honor.
He seems to be an extraordinary man.
It would be wise to make an ally of him.
"Captain, it is I, Tae-bong."
Come in.
What is it?
The new governor is headed for Chunghae.
Why is he going to Chunghae?
I haven't found that out yet.
The scout ship is ready to set sail.
Search the waters near Yongeum Island.
You will be able to find Yum Moon's hideout.
He could attack any minute.
Be very careful during your mission.
"Yes, sir."
Set sail!
What division do the troops belong to?
"That's the flag of the Sajageum division, the Mujinju governor's guards."
My lord.
What brings you out in this cold weather?
The new governor is here to pay his respects to you.
What brings you to Chunghae?
I have been appointed governor of Mujinju by your grace.
I came to pay my respects.
You came all this way just to pay your respects?
"If you have the time, you should use it to carry out your duty."
You didn't seem very friendly to the governor.
What happened to you?
"I did try, Clark."
"In fact, when we first met, you inspired me."
"All I wanted was to be your friend, but... you turned your back on me."
So you're the person you are today because of me.
I tried to be your friend.
But all you care about is power and control.
This is Smallville!
"Meteor freaks, alien ships, cryptic symbols!"
These threats are real.
Someone had to take control.
Someone has to protect the world.
Listen to yourself.
"You're so caught up in your own delusions, you've lost track of reality."
Have I?
Then let's talk about something you can't deny.
"After years of pleading with my father to show me some compassion, he turned to you, with open arms."
"What would a worldly billionaire have in common, with a simple farm boy?"
Maybe he just knew he could trust me.
Of course.
Everyone can trust Clark Kent.
You're the perfect son.
So why did Jonathan Kent always seem so stressed?
Was raising the perfect son really that much work?
I wonder how much of a strain it put on his heart.
Are you blaming me for my father's death?
Are you?
!
"You're the guilty one, not me."
"And this time, you're gonna own up to what you've done."
I know you killed Lionel.
- Who's delusional now?
Are they affiliated with anybody up here?
They seem to have good relations with a Latino street gang that moved up here from L.A. about 3 years ago.
"That gang was originally from Guatemala, very tight, impossible to penetrate."
Half of them were in the army.
"These are the guys who are gonna take Reardon's place, much nastier."
Let's talk about what might happen if Reardon left the dope scene.
- You predict chaos.
- Mayhem.
You can already smell it.
"Now with the Americans in the picture, it could get even uglier."
They bring a lot of guns along.
It gets exponentially crazier.
We should be proactive on this and pursue your idea of trying to encourage an alliance.
That might avoid all that.
Can you speak to Dante about that?
See if you can plant that in his ear?
Thanks for listening to me.
"How are you, honey?"
You want some more juice?
- What are you doing today?
- I'm gonna take Sweet shopping and look for a crib.
"I thought after, I'd take them to see the house we're looking at."
That's a good idea.
"Let me know what you think, besides the fact they're asking ten-times too much."
Have fun.
Did Ronnie tell you two we wanted you
- to be godparents?
- I'd be so proud.
Thank you.
Really?
Thank you.
What an honour.
Your money?
"My five thousand, that you owe me."
You probably mean this here.
You glue money to the wall?
Is that five thousand?
Yes.
You owe me money and glue it to the wall?
Are you insane?
"Toni, look at it like this."
"My office is your place of pilgrimage,"
You can always come here and beg forgiveness for your greed.
Stop this bullshit!
Euro-Basilica!
"From now on, we'll call it Euro-Basilica!"
I'll have you sent to the insane asylum.
You along with your loony sister and the other idiots too.
Should I explain how I really see it?
"So my dear Franz, I'll give you untill the end of the week to get these bills off the wall."
"Otherwise I'll call the police, and I'll call the press."
"That way the whole world can see the idiots, with whom I have to co-exist."
I also have to co-exist with you... with your America fetish and the stench of your bar... and the constantly changing waitresses bitching to us that you won't pay them.
"Actually, I should bash your face in for all this."
But my father and your father are brothers.
"Well, I'll come up with a plan."
Think up something.
"And you darling, come up with a plan as well."
I already have.
Try getting them off with steam.
Max the Hunter
Max the Hunter
- Excuse me.
What?
You are now looking at the new colonel of the ninth regiment.
"And this time, the uniform is going to be the genuine article."
"Where'd you get it, jim?"
Are they selling commissions now?
"No, of course not."
I just paid the regiment's deficit and told the militia boys i'd get them a job on the railroad.
"Work is the crying need of today, luke."
"And besides, they're a nice, tough bunch of boys to have around in case of trouble."
Now you go out and get them a job on the erie.
The whole regiment?
Yeah.
"Go ahead, go ahead."
"You know, i feel just like an actor having my uniform made in theater."
What's the matter with this waistline?
"It sticks out a bit, don't it?"
"Only sticks out where you stick out, boss."
"Say, what goes with these suits?"
A bass drum or a bugle?
"Say, i want a shiny sword, too."
"But you only carry a sword while on parade, mr."
Fisk.
It doesn't make any difference.
"Even if it don't cut cheese, i'm not gonna fight with it, anyway."
One shiny sword.
"- Yes, sir."
And put a big hunk of gold on the handle.
"Yes, sir."
"You know, i always did like a uniform."
"Me, too."
You could make me a dozen uniforms like this.
"Here's josephine, napoleon."
"Well, do i pass inspection?"
Enough with the complicated stuff.
Just tell me whether or not you can save him... as a doctor.
You bastard!
What are you doing right now?
Answer me.
I can save him.
Then save him.

There's about to be a war!
I'm going to kill you all for mutiny!
His blood pressure is dropping too much too suddenly.
There's too much bleeding.
What are we going to do?
"If something bad happens to this patient, aren't we all going to die?"
"Dismiss Captain Yoo Si Jin of his duties for disobeying command, and... get ready to place him under detention."
"So then, why did you do something that useless?"
Useless?
!
"Because of me, one person's life--I haven't seen Captain Yoo around..."
Did he go somewhere?
"According to military code, he'll go to prison for disobeying command."
"How could you not know this, when you're the one who argued to proceed with the surgery that everyone was against doing?"
FERON:
This should be a good show.
"Yeah, it's just like Morgan, going out with style."
"S-s-so, Annie was a doll."
Glad you two had fun.
We had some interesting conversations.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Mm-hmm, about the business model."
"What we've been doing right, wrong, how to expand, where to get more pento."
I had a feeling you'd get her back onside.
I can be very convincing.
Mmm.
I love funerals.
Nothing like staring death in the face to make you feel alive.
"Watch the Series Premiere of The Blacklist Redemption, Thursday on Global."
Scottie Hargrave is in charge of a global intelligence gathering operation.
"You should know, I have anger issues."
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Take it easy.
You're hired.
You want me to work for you?
We could do incredible things together.
You really know how to push my buttons.
Welcome to the family.
"Your sister's response is a typical consequence of loss, numbness that follows a period of intense grief."
"Losing one's parents, especially so suddenly, can be deeply disorienting."
Rest is what she needs.
"At Rosewood, she will have the benefit of time and privacy to recuperate."
"I don't see why, if rest and recuperation is what you prescribe, we couldn't simply repair to the coast as usual."
"Or if warmer weather is what she needs, we could go to Italy."
Then you cook on her.
You ass.
From how long is this going on?
- Why are you hitting her unjustly?
Why are you feeling when I am hitting her?
Why are you talking so with such a great man?
What ?
He is shown concern on you at the hospital and now you are showing on him.
Are you both planning to show me a movie now?
"Hubby, it is ₹ 5 lakhs."
You liked it and bought it at Germany.
I do not care..
"Tukaram sir, you are unnecessarily imagining whatever."
He is a public figure.
But my wife is a private figure.
- You are misunderstanding.
"I am telling as a wife, he is a very great man."
And has also got Padmasri in recognition to that.
Opposition people used this photo to showcase him bad.
"Though your husband looks cunning, you look very genuine."
What do you want me to do?
You should have a press meet and say publicly.
"You want me to make all public, that happened in private till now?"
"Not that he has a relation, but you should say there is no relation."
"Still, what are these issues on our marriage day?"
Your marriage day?
- It is so in the script.
Script?
- In the script written by Lord Brahma.
I will think tonight in my drink whether to come tomorrow or not.
"Karthik, he is over acting a lot."
"- True, sir!"
"Hey, hey, look at this."
You won a prize.
Yeah.
What is that?
Homework.
They're assigning Cosmopolitan as homework?
"No, they assigned this, but I'm getting nowhere with it."
You can't relate that to the real world.
Like how?
"Like, was Mom a virgin when you married her?"
"What are you studying, religion?"
Sex.
Are you going to tell me about Mom or not?
No.
"Boy, that's good coffee."
Fresh brewed?
Instant.
"Now, how 'bout if you love someone?"
Do you have to have sex with them?
This can't be instant.
We ran out of beans.
"And if you kiss a girl, what base is that, and where's the birth canal?"
I have a chart.
"You never have to have sex if you don't want to, kissing a girl's first base, the birth canal's right there, and you shouldn't have sex unless you're in love and probably married."
Why not?
I don't remember-- it has something to do with not wanting to have babies with people you don't know.
It says in this magazine that there's a spot on a woman you can touch to drive her completely insane.
I don't think the magazine's a good idea.
"And in my experience, there is no such place."
Dad.
What?
"When I grow up, do I have to have hair all over my body?"
"-Yes, I do know."
"-First, you talk about a beating... and then we find out all you're discussing is a single blow."
Would you say that the arguments in the Lucas Cross house... were more or less violent than any other family arguments?
-Objection!
-What's the purpose of that question?
The witness must define her terms if the jury and this court... are to clearly understand what she means.
"A beating becomes one blow, a blow becomes a slap?"
Perhaps the slap will become something else.
Objection overruled.
-I have no further questions.
"-No questions, your Honor."
You may step down.
The prosecution would like to call Mrs. Constance MacKenzie.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Constance MacKenzie.
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've known the defendant a long time."
"Yes, since she was a baby."
Did Selena ever complained that her stepfather had beaten her... at any time?
-What?
-Did Selena ever complained...
"Oh, no."
No.
"Did you ever see any marks on her, injuries?"
No.
"You knew the defendant 's mother well, did you not?"
Nellie worked for me as a house maid.
Did she ever mentioned Lucas' brutality or... described any beating he had ministered?
"No, she said he was drunk and and lazy, and he deserted her..."
- Good day.
- Good day.
How can I help you?
I'm collecting for the local children's hospital.
"Would you care to make a donation, however modest?"
"Well, cabinet makers don't make much, but I think I could contribute a little something."
- (coins clinking)
- Every penny counts.
- Do you have children?
"- No, I don't."
It's a shame.
"There was a time when I thought I'd pass my skills on to a son, or a daughter for that matter."
But it wasn't to be.
"50 cents,"
- would that be enough?
- Absolutely.
"You know, you might have more luck in another part of town."
People around here are barely putting food on the table.
"It's not they don't have good hearts, you understand?"
I just don't want my neighbours feeling badly for having to say no to you.
"Of course, it's very thoughtful."
- Thank you for your time.
- Have a good day.
- (coins clinking) - (door closing)
"I started when the poor boy's body was found, and I'm working backwards from there."
I'm down to 1890.
"It's very illuminating, sir, once you drop into the minutiae of it."
Here's a story about a sow that gave birth to 13 piglets.
Now that's a North Kawartha township record.
Very interesting.
"Sir, come look at this."
A farmer reports two British Home Children ran away from his employ:
Get up!
Can you handle this?
Henry.
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
I love how protective you are of me.
- You owe me an apology.
- For?
Doubting me.
- I did have certain apprehensions.
- Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
Is everybody dead?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
"We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
You... little... pussy.
That's what my old man called me.
It's like it was my name.
And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.
"I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide... are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?"
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a sh guy.
His clothes were dockers from sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large,the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear,gibbs."
"You're fishin',abs."
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer,have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes,doctor."
"Well,let's plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
"Agent gibbs will be here soon and he will ask... how'd the lance corporal die,doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try,""when did he die?"
""" That's my next question."
"That,I can answer."
It's a tricky calcution.
"One has to factor in temperature,soil acidity, and the variety and volume of insects who now call lance corporal finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days,with a three-rcent margin of error."
"It would appear you deserted before you die gibbs,lance corporal finn's fianc?"
's upstairs.
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"W,doctor?"
"As soon as I know,you'll know."
"Her name is siri albert.She's 25, lives in manassas,and works a physical therapist."
Finn's fianc?
"Whenever you've got anything to sell, whether it's a carriage, a steamboat, or an actress, you've got to spruce it up."
Give it sparkle.
I really believe that this is going to help make our corporation look successful.
I'll wear it.
"Wait a minute- gentlemen, please!"
"Now, mr."
Fisk is a busy man.
He'll see you when he gets time.
He sees everybody.
Now will you hoot owls sit down and stop hooting?
"A man gets rich, and it spreads like the itch."
"Now wait, first- all you inventors, please sit over on that side."
All the inventors.
"Sit down, neighbor, please."
"Hey, what are you?"
I'm just plain hungry.
Hungry?
"Well, everybody that's hungry, you sit on that side, please."
Sit down.
Wait a minute- are you an inventor or are you hungry?
Yes.
"Listen, you inventors, hungry or not, you got to sit over there in the patent office, that's on that side."
"Would you mind sitting down, neighbor, please?"
I trusted mr.
"Fisk, and he sat right there and told me an almighty lie."
"Oh, now, uncle daniel, do you think jim fisk would lie to you for $500,000?"
"Yes, i do."
"Yeah, well, so do i."
"What have you got, son?"
I've got an invention that will save you the bother of carrying around matches.
"It's good for pipes, cigars, almost anything."
And the flame is always lit.
We want to keep it a good school.
Do you know what I mean?
- Yes sir.
"- No, you don't, son."
"You see, I've got these officers here, the school board, the newspapers..."
"the television and a whole lot of nasty, angry parents."
They all want to know something about what happened.
And you're the person who knows that something.
Right now you are standing between...
"me and my ability to keep this good school and I don't like that, son."
I don't like it when people do things to my school.
You get my meaning?
"So, why don't you tell us what was the noise that caused you..."
to come out of the bathroom?
"- Hey, Brian."
How are you doing?
- You actually know my name.
Of course I know your name.
How are they treating you Bri?
Baseball bats?
Electrodes attached to various parts of your anatomy?
Excuse me. I have a class.
J ust remember what happens to snitches.
"- Hey, Brian."
Are you okay?
"- Yes, sure."
I'm really sorry you're the person that has to deal with this.
- lt's no problem.
- Because you know...
"if you saw something, like somebody had a gun, then you should tell them."
"If you don't, you would be part of it and people are really scared, Brian."
"So, you should tell them if you saw anything."
If I take that much energy out Of sam to follow my plan.
And it turns out That my plan was.
"Just a little bit halfassed In its architecture, then..."
"I mean, that's not cool."
"The first test buckets Are blanks,"
"But hoping to stake a claim He can work for years,"
Zeke's not giving up just yet.
We're gonna have to find a way.
To get a little further North of the hole.
You have to have faith That things are going.
To work out in the end.
"Following the geology, there's A lot of reason to believe."
That there might be A lot more gold out there.
Than anyone can Possibly imagine.
70 miles to the east...
We made it!
Hell yeah!
After an agonizing 13hour journey...
Whoo!
Kris kelly is within sight Of the bluff.
We barely made it.
"If this is half as good As everybody says it is,"
This is gonna be The greatest thing.
That's ever happened To me or my family.
Nobody has this opportunity.
"There's no chance in america You can go and say,"
"""Hey, you go do this, there,"
"And you're gonna make A million dollars."""
Nobody has that chance.
"Now, the only thing Kris has to do."
"Is figure out how to sleep, How to eat, how to mine,"
And how to avoid a mutiny.
Here´s the situation.
We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.
We believe he is headed to Los Angeles or is here already.
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area.
"Our only lead is Nina Myers, who´s being brought back to CTU right now."
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.
Adam´s done a workup on him.
"We have some background, but nothing places him definitively in Los Angeles today."
That´s it?
What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?
"Our data tracking´s a little behind, so we weren´t able to access that report."
Why are we behind?
We didn´t update the European contact logs while I was down.
"- Michelle, you were the ranking agent."
- l didn´t think Europe was a priority.
- Obviously it was.
- There was a lot going on at the time.
All right.
Let´s get back to work.
"Let´s try to ease up on the mistakes, as there are millions of lives depending on us."
Michelle.
- (knocking)
- Come.
I just got off with CTU.
- What´s the status on the virus?
- lt´s not good.
The limited intelligence they have supports their suspicion.
- lt´s on its way to Los Angeles?
"- David, it may already be here."
We should prepare in case they target other cities.
Our people in the security envelope have been alerted. lt´s being handled.
- Have you had a fight?
Scum!
He came for beer.
I told him the store is shut.
He took it perforce
He even broke the statue of The Goddess!
Bloody half-caste!
"I say Lajjo, thank God that you and your daughters... haven't been marred by this British ness!"
"Else, you would've been nowhere!"
Dam these scoundrels!
"Set sail in stormy waters, and you're in danger of sinking"
You were so little when we brought you here.
And now...
They said that a grown-up daughter is a burden on a man
"But a daughter like you, makes a father's chest swell with pride!"
You're my good girl
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish
I want to take a look at Europe
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going
Please don't be cross.
"I have never disobeyed you, Babuji"
I'll be going away to a land I have never seen
The man I'm going to marry is a complete stranger.
But...
I have no complaints.
You must've considered it in my best interests
But I won't get a chance like this ever again.
I don't even know whether I'll ever come back... whether I will have these friends later on
"Besides, it's only for a month."
"In a month, I will have lived a lifetime"
You're on.
May the best lawyer win.
I still can't believe he got fired.
"I mean, the whole time I was covering for him,"
I never thought Larissa would actually... do it.
What is it you're not saying?
Why can't you just admit it?
Admit what?
You knew Bennet was on shaky ground.
What'd you think was gonna happen when you took his story?
That she'd yell at him or something?
"And I'm sorry, but Bennet was never actually going to that party, which means he would have been fired anyway."
I just seized an opportunity.
Anyone would have.
No.
A lot of people wouldn't.
I wouldn't.
"Come on, Carrie."
Admit it.
You went for the jugular.
"You wanted something so bad, you didn't care someone else might get hurt in the process."
It's not that simple.
I didn't mean for Bennet to get hurt.
But he did.
I don't expect you to understand.
You never had to claw your way to get something.
"But if I'm going to be a writer,"
I'm gonna have to work my butt off
- and fight for it.
"- Oh, come on."
"It's not like you're some poor, struggling artist."
You're an intern at a magazine who lives with her father and doesn't have to worry about money or a roof over her head.
No more mozzarella mama...
Since I moved to LA I haven't really had a substantial boyfriend.
I seem to gravitate towards casual relationships of convenience.
Sometimes though I do wish for something more meaningful.
In Los Angeles most people feel like they've never actually arrived.
There's always this chase for something bigger and better.
Consequently no one puts down roots.
No one settles down.
It's like living in this state of perpetual vagrancy.
I want some roots... at least I think I do.
Oh my God did you... did you hear?
Maybe.
"2012, there is this huge planet that is going to crash into earth and kill... everyone!"
Oh you mean like the movie?
"No, I don't mean like the movie."
This is real Dale!
The movie is based on the facts.
The planet... is called Nadie!
"I don't know how he got his name and why it isn't six or eight, but"
Seven is my colleague... roommate...
and closest confidant.
And I don't think I'm outing him by saying
Seven won't be taking any girls home.
It's all over the internet I'm obsessed with it.
I can't stop reading.
It's kind of scary don't you think?
I mean the end of the world Dale.
I don't know if I can sleep tonight?
Bowie... you wanna snuggle with me?
Huh?
Come here.
I'm taking your dog.
Very good.
- What's he done?
"(Stephen) Peter, explain."
"Well, I think this is what it is."
"When a director directs a film, and, like, say if the studio interfere and they re-edit it and the director disowns the film, they can choose to put Alan Smithee instead of their real name."
- Absolutely right.
Absolutely right.
Yes.
- (applause)
"Alan Smithee is the name used when directors disown a film, either because they've lost control of the final cut, or it's simply too awful to admit to."
"Smithee's oeuvre include such classics as Hobgoblins II,"
"Boggy Creek III, Hellraiser IV and, most famously, Dune, where he codirected with David Lynch."
"So, very well done."
How did you know about that?
You just knew?
I...
"Well, Tony Kaye did that - tried to do that."
- (Stephen) With American History X.
- Yeah.
"And I never saw American History X because I didn't see any of the first nine, you know, so..."
"Oh, you literate fellow."
"Now, The Boy on a Dolphin isn't a Smithee film,"
- but it did star the very short matinee idol...
- (elephant trumpets)
- Alan Ladd.
- (Stephen) Yes.
Another half point to take you up to a full one point for your two splendid intrusions.
- Sophia Loren was in it.
I've actually seen it.
- Very good.
And what can you tell me about the making of the film that's quite interesting?
(laughter)
"Matt, please listen to me."
No!
"No, I should've known you'd go behind my back."
"Okay, but I have a long list of people seriously considering adopting them."
- I ain't interested!
- Why not?
"Because, quite frankly, I can save time and money sending them to auction."
"Matt, please, I don't believe you!"
"Look, these horses, they could have great homes."
There are people willing to pay for them.
The end result is the same.
There's still money in your pocket.
"Okay, here's the deal."
I'm a reasonable man.
- Okay...
- Do whatever you want with them...
"But... tomorrow morning, they go to the highest bidder, be it the glue factory or someone who wants to adopt."
"So... go ahead and rally your troops, but I'll be the one making the final decision."
All right.
I understand your husband works in Vancouver.
"- Um, how often is he home?"
"- He travels for work, but that doesn't put a strain on the relationship."
A strain?
Why do you use that word?
"No, no."
I said there isn't... a strain.
Moving on.
"Um, let's discuss Georgie's recent injury."
Can you take me through how that actually happened?
Georgie takes trick riding lessons and she was practicing in our ring.
"You know, I'm surprised someone as young as Georgie's"
- doing such a dangerous sport.
"After Everett had abused me,"
"Carrington sang me this really, really beautiful tune, and everybody... everybody just went just deadly silent and I sat there going, ""Oh."""
"Oh, my God, I think he likes you."
"I do, seriously."
I don't think he does.
"No, I don't think he does, no."
"Oh, chaperone at 12:00."
"Next time, there's trouble in paradise."
A beautiful stranger arrives.
"I am a bit flirtatious, but, hey, rules are made to be broken."
A handsome rival returns.
And I think Mr. Carrington will break my heart.
"There are fisticuffs galore, and finally the gloves come off."
The thing with very good girls is that when they're bad...
They're very bad.
They're very bad.
It's a deliciously naughty time at the Regency House Party.

What can you expect?
Bottoms up.
A storm is brewing as a wealthy heiress joins the party...
"I am a bit flirtatious, but, hey, rules are made to be broken."
A handsome rival returns...
I think Mr. Carrington will break my heart.
The men conduct a secret fight...
This is highly illegal.
And one lady... breaks all the rules.
"Breast, anyone?"
At the Regency House Party.
I'm watching.

And...
Jimmy here is an educated guy.
So go fuck yourself.
"- I was gonna go with a more diplomatic response, but it's Pete's bar, so I guess, go fuck yourself is an order."
"Go fuck yourself, young lady."
How dare you ask the teacher a question?
"- Hey, Dad."
You wanna go lay down?
- What?
- Why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a minute?
- What for?
"- Maybe you're tired, maybe you want to lie down."
- Iâm fine.
"- Iâm on the boardwalk, me and my daughter."
It's quiet.
"Suddenly, you hear ""Homicides, Homicides, Homicides."""
"- Ooh, Homicides, the Homicides."
"- Worst gang in Brooklyn, worst gang in Brooklyn."
About 80 of them in their leathers running right towards us.
"And they're yelling ""Homicides, Homicides."""
"Iâm looking at my daughter like, is there something you're not telling me?"
Are you in a feud with the crazy Homicides?
They stole your pop rocks?
I don't know.
They're coming right at us.
George:
What happened?
"- Just then, right behind us, but in the same direction, four or five members of the Jolly Stompers."
"- Oh, thatâs the guys who's in the satin jackets."
"- Jolly Stompers, I mean, terrifying when you see them on the train, but when there's 80 Homicides chasing them, fairly docile."
One of them had a little ball of shit rolling down his pant leg as he ran.
They were scared.
Hello!
"I thought we didn't buy into this whole God, myth, mortal sin bullshit."
"No, but I believe there's a natural order and a fine balance to life and if the rhythms are violated Oh fuck, Fuzz!"
I want you to stop seeing the wretched woman!
Do you hear me?
Most of the Eastern seaboard can!
I am going to report her to the school and she'll go to prison and you can visit her on weekends.
You can't stop us.
We love each other!
"Oh, now you're being a petulant little fucking idiot."
Is this how you counsel your suicidal patients?
(Slam!
)
Oh!
"Come on, Flick. 'Tonight these artists have come of age.'"
I deserve to make a living.
"You earn yours defending drug barons and pimps and yes, I do bloody care about the bloody Congolese."
"(Mobile phone rings) These are good, aren't they?"
He's got your baggy eyes.
"Yes, he's good."
But you know that.
"Yeah, but he's very good, isn't he?"
I need to see more.
Goes by the name of Pica.
Formerly known as Denny Lorton.
These are Lorton's?
How recent?
"Who is he, first?"
"Who was he, you mean?"
"Prize student at Courtaulds, several major exhibitions, two paintings in the National Gallery."
"He was knocking on the door big-time, then he disappeared."
I thought he was dead.
He used to hang but he ain't been all right.
"You may not realize this, but some men prefer the company of women."
Who?
Howdy Doody?
He don't get no booty.
Maybe he's got himself a date with the Tuck Job.
Nah.
Your mother said she couldn't make it.
Reznik talk...
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Deja vu?
You're tired.
Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails.
I'm well aware of that.
These Xindi are innocent.
"If we let them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us."
"I don't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality out the window when things start getting a little rough."
Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed also believe that this would compromise our mission.
Your opinions have been noted.
"Now, get back to Enterprise and start the antimatter transfer."
"I'm sorry, Captain, I can't obey that order."
"You may not be wearing a uniform, but you can still be charged with insubordination."
Perhaps we should contact Starfleet and discuss this with Admiral Forrest.
You're relieved as First Officer.
Major... escort T'Pol back to the ship and confine her to her quarters.
-Sir...?
-I gave you an order.
Ma'am...?
- His words exactly.
You tried to drown yourself.
"- No, boss."
- A hundred yards out.
Pitch-black.
You were drowning yourself and in the course of drowning yourself
- you swam into our bloated blacksmith.
"- No, boss."
"- Yes, boss."
"You know what that will get you, Katherine McVitie?"
100 lashes.
"You might think your life miserable now, but it will be a lot worse after 100 lashes."
How dare you do this to me?
How dare you prefer death?
Get out.
- sir.
I get sick of hummus after four bites.
"Max, we have to take charge of this."
Because whatever bridesmaid's dress Sophie picks is like a Tyler Perry movie.
I don't have to see it to know it's gonna be awful.
"We'll find something classy, and beautiful, and just shove it down her throat."
Who's shoving what down whom?
"And if you don't have a story, I do."
"John, Max and I got roped into being bridesmaids."
Stop.
You had me at rope.
You lost me at bridesmaids.
"I'll be at the hostess stand, looking at dresses and silently wishing for an asteroid to wipe us off the planet."
"If wishes made things happen, we'd been in the middle of a zombie apocalypse right now."
"Hey, girls."
My dress just arrived from Poland and I'm bustin' for you to see it.
See it while I eat one of your $14 puddings.
Then you'll see a smaller passageway.
"Captain, what are you doing?"
There's one more person I have to find.
Guards!
"After all that time I spent looking for you, all I had to do was wait here."
Shields down to 23 percent.
We've got to get out of their weapons range.
Scan one more time for the away team.
There's no sign of them.
Prepare to break orbit.
Wait!
Set a course bearing 219 mark 47.
"Where are you taking us, Mr. Kim?"
There's a large electrical storm over the northern magnetic pole.
Is giving our sensors some trouble.
It should do the same for theirs.
- A blind spot.
- Exactly.
"If we maintain our position directly above the storm, their sensor net may not be able to keep an accurate lock on our position."
How long do you think this'll work?
The storm's already dissipating.
A few more minutes?
I'll take every second I can get.
"I must say I'm impressed, Caylem."
You never made it this far before.
"Every so often, he goes on one of his missions... to rescue his wife."
She's been dead for 12 years.
Lies.
Lies...
lies!
Sometimes...he gets all the way up to the front gate.
We send him on his way and allow him to serve as a reminder of just how futile it is to challenge us.
♪ He's dead ♪
"Coming up, a cat fight over a parking spot, [struggles] Get off of me!"
- And...
- I'm gonna kill you all!
A criminal gets his slate wiped clean.
[Screams]
What is your problem?
Bitch!
"You know, there are some things that just aren't worth fighting for."
- Don't touch me!
"- Right, that's it!"
Like a parking spot.
But don't tell that to Brenda.
"When it came to the road, she was a ticking time bomb."
"The whole parking lot, and there's not one frickin' spot!"
"For people who truly experience intermittent explosive disorder, there usually is an escalation of events, so someone cutting you off in traffic, or taking your parking spot, may not seem like a big deal to you or me,"
"but for someone with this disorder, uh, it flips them into a state that they can't control."
[Sighs]
[Growls]
Then Amy slipped into a spot she'd been patiently waiting for.
"Oh, hell no!"
And Brenda went off.
"Well, are you gonna move your car?"
What the hell?
What are gonna do?
"This is my boss' car, you crazy lady!"
Maybe you should tell your boss why you didn't move your car.
What is your problem?
- Ah!
- I said get-- get off of me!
That's how two chicks start fighting over a parking spot.
[Struggling]
Anyone will go bonkers or finished if he sees me...
"If I allow him to touch me, anyone would become my slave..."
"If I give little liberty on me, anyone will go mad..."
Anyone would die in the fire of my desire...
It's run into the wilderness...
It's fire of passion of fans...
This attack is fatal...
Nobody can stop this stealing of hearts...
"If you make a request, you'll enjoy the fun..."
"If you tease with romance, I'll take you to the bliss..."
It seems he's a latest thief.
"Without any discrimination, he's robbing every one."
The doors remain closed but the money inside vanishes.
That's the magic!
"Forget all this, I'm giving you full powers as the Home Minister."
Close down his file swiftly.
- First theft...
- July 5th.
It happened on 5th.
12 thefts in 10 months.
"According to you, it's Rs.75 crores."
Much more according to me.
He didn't spare anyone.
"Before robbing doctor, his name appeared on newspaper a day earlier."
Lawyer appeared on TV a day earlier before he was robbed.
He robbed Minister's home a day after he commented on the thief.
All his victims were news makers before getting robbed by him.
He's leaving clues to us and enjoying our inability.
He's not a regular thief.
Hey you!
Did you read the files already?
I read him well.
"Well, what..."
"Minor illnesses, minor infections..."
Completely minor things   that could be cured for tiny sums if one only had the will.
We've developed a sort of priority list...
You're an angry man.
That's good.
It gives you a lot of drive.
"The educational supplies we need include books, tables, chairs, beds   but what we need most urgently is medicine."
Eventually we'd like to...
"Yes, yes."
We'd like to take twice as many off the streets.
- Would you like one?
"- No, thanks."
We'd like to take in twice as many and vaccinate them   which could be done all for less than five kroner a day.
And we'd like to change our food program...
- Do they all sleep in the same room?
- We have 45 at the moment.
"We go to an area, and in two minutes, 40-50 kids gather, who we then feed."
"But after five minutes, there are 500 kids."
- I don't need to see more.
- The new kids...
It's an extremely impressive project you have established.
Very impressive.
I've looked at different ways I might be able to help.
Thank you very much.
"In all, I found five different projects."
Yours is one of the most interesting.
Thank you.
We're glad to hear it.
But may I ask you why?
Like I said...
It's a good project.
- Just stop.
"Nobody's doing this job, okay?"
Not even Uncle Eddie.
[alarm sounds] [radio announcer] ...
many consider Cezanne to be the bridge between Post-Impressionism and Cubism.
"In fact, both Matisse and Picasso called him ""the father of us all."""
He was a remarkable innovator...  [grunting]
Little-known fact:
Cezanne was rejected by the Paris Salon for 18 years.
"But he never gave up, until 1882, when they finally exhibited his 1866"
"""Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cezanne,"""
"the father of the artist, reading L'Évenement, his first and last successful submission."
"[Eddie] What the fuck you mean, it won't play?"
"I'm telling you, it won't play."
"It won't play, or you won't play with your brother?"
Ah!
Thought you guys were supposed to eat about it.
"Can you not yell, please?"
"What, do I gotta sit you two punks down again"
- and talk about family values?
"- Eddie,"
I cannot work with him.
And I will not work with that psycho girlfriend of his.
"- For Chrissake, she attacked Sonja."
- So what?
"A couple broads, they get handsy with each other and you wanna call the whole goddamn thing off with all that money just sittin' there waitin' for us."
Listen to me.
It's not.
"These people that you're tryin' to rob, they're not just some banditos from down South."
Okay?
They're degenerate killers.
"Yeah, well, they ain't never met Eddie Cruickshank."
Just a minute.

That's right.
Like that.
Stop blowing now and drink it.
Do you really have nowhere to go?
Whether a house or dorm or a contact person or the cell phone number of someone you know?
A guardian or a friend or something like that...
Who am I talking to right now?
I should have just left.
I think that I've been caught right well and good.
I'll go and wash up so go change into this for now at least.
Hotel
What the...?
"Seriously, Hey!"
Turn on the light!
Give it.
Give it here!
"Are you, by any chance, being coy?"
Don't!
Don't do that!
Don't be coy!
My ideal type is an intellectual woman.
A complete opposite of you!
Don't look at me lubriciously like that.
"Just in case you misunderstand, I am telling you clearly."
"The reason I brought you here is because the day is almost over, it's raining, and your screw is a bit loose, so, ""I'll let her stay just for one night."" That was all!"
"So, ""Oh, my!"
"Is this man interested in me?"""
"""Should I use the opportunity to hook up with him somehow?"""
Let go of this kind of futile expectation or hope.
"Wake up from your dream, I tell you!"
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must have made a nice change for her.
She noshed me off for free so that tells you something.
"Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
"Problem is, isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?"
"Entrances, lobbies."
"Exit to runways, manager's office."
There's a blind spot in the toilets which could be a good thing.
It's the one thing everyone does before they get on a plane.
Didn't you say the front entrance was covered?
"Yeah, I can get you in a different way."
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course on my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"Spider, right?"
Not the nickname I heard.
Grantham Hill Private Airfield
We're done.
I'm gonna go and stay with my sister now.
I assume that we never meet again which is a tragedy I'll just have to learn to live with.
Here are the keys to the flat.
We're not finished yet.
"We had an agreement, Lenny."
"Yeah, but I think you overestimated your ability to insist on dealbreakers though."
You gave me an undertaking
To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"Send me back to prison, then, please."
We can do that.
"It was wrong, sir."
I did it without thinking.
"It got me in trouble, which I accept full responsibility for."
"It made trouble for the Navy, which I would fix if I could, but I can't."
And it got Fanny in terrible trouble.
Her life is at risk for wanting to be with me.
I'm sorry about all of it.
I really am.
How long has the cord been prolapsed?
"Since right before we called you, Dr. Chadway."
Foetal heart rate is falling again.
- She had an epidural?
- Two hours ago.
All right.
Prepare for a C-section.
- Bud!
- The head's too far down.
Get me a vacuum and call Neonatal for resuscitation at delivery.
"I'll take it from here, Dr. Chadway."
"- Where have you been, Dr. Gettis?"
- With another patient.
"Okay, Harriet, the next contraction, get ready to push."
Petty Officer Elling.
Would you and your counsel please stand?
You may announce the sentence.
"Petty Officer Third Class James Elling, in consideration of your plea of guilty to all charges and specifications and your declared remorse, this court-martial sentences you to be reduced to the rank of seaman and to forfeit $500 pay per month for three months."
"Members, thank you for your service."
This court-martial is adjourned.
- No brig time?
- No brig time.
"I gotta go see Fanny, sir."
"Yes, you do."
You should advise him to turn himself in.
Thank you for coming!
Excuse me!
"I heard... that Kim So Mi received her 50 million won deposit, in its entirety."
So we came to ask if we'll also get our deposits back as soon as we sign our agreements.
If you can at least do that much... then we can move out...
even though we'll still be at a loss...
Lawyer Seo.
I'm sorry.
"The special time period for the full deposit refund, has ended."
- A special time period?
- What is she saying?
- What are you talking about?
- It's not a sale period!
"Are you mocking us, or what?"
"It's not that you don't have the money, you just don't want to give it to us."
"- Let's just go, come on."
- Let's get out of here.
"Look here, Representative!"
"Do you really think we'll fall apart, because you keep playing us like this?"
No way!
Don't you know that people who have no money live to protect their pride?
I really can't believe this...
"One moment, please."
"There is, still one opportunity."
"We can't give you 50 million won anymore, now that the special time period is over."
"But, I will swear on my name, and promise you, 40 million won."
- 40 million won?
- 40 million?
Really?
"Can you really give all of us, 40 million won?"
Yes.
"- Okay, sit down."
"We are not in this battle alone, I've enlisted the aid... of a very valued ally."
Deep Throat?
He was instrumental in cracking the case of the missing Manolo Blahnik.
"Roxette, do you really think we need the Deep Throat?"
Why can't we just find the Yuri within ourselves?
"Call me silly, but I have a hunch it might be..."
- Pierre Larroux.
- Nonsense!
"Pierre may be an obsequious, ass-licking meretricious... sick offend, but Yuri he's not."
He's off to a secret shoot... for Vogue.
- What?
- Lies!
He'd better not be.
"Ok, now let's move on."
Cornelia?
"Chi Chi, any trend report from the front?"
"I heard from the chef at ""Daveé"", who heard from his boyfriend... who works backstage at Galliano, with Orlando Pitta... whose blow drier system just came from the Gautier show... that his next collection will be revolutionary."
The girls will come out on the catwalk... in wheelchairs.
Wheelchair chic?
- Genius!
- Inspirational.
I think Da Vinci did sketches of wheelchair prototypes.
- We can use those for the layout.
- I have goose bumps.
Nine pages!
"Jocelyn, I see you put your name down for the..."
"""make your own video"" booth."
Do you know?
I think I'm gonna join you on that one.
"Paul, Jocelyn, why don't you guys run over to Gustav's studio now... and I'll be there in a few minutes All right?"
Just sit tight.
"So, I refused to front him the money, because I didn't want to encourage him."
"But maybe he did, anyway."
If he did...
The escort agency-- you got the address?
"Well, yeah, we need everything you got."
Sooner the better.
What's going on?
Your text said you were looking into an escort agency.
That was the idea.
He's on the phone with the fire marshal.
"Based on the weathering of this tape and the graying of the ash, the place was burned down two days ago."
No question it was arson.
Agency's computers and paperwork were all covered with gasoline and lit up.
Problem is finding who did it.
Agency employees all vanished.
"Paperwork's gone, and the names that I could find are fake."
The whole thing was owned by a shell company.
- Sounds like organized crime.
- Yeah.
I wish I could tell you which kind.
Office manager was named
"Carla Petro, but nobody who met her thought she looked Italian, and her name is as fake as the rest."
Is he okay?
He's fine.
"Your arsonist was driving a fully-restored, vintage Ford Mustang, model year 1965, '66, '67 or '68."
Color unknown.
How can you know that?
You say in your report you found a charred wastebasket inside.
You thought it was used to splash petrol around the office.
So?
"So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?"
Why not a gas can?
"Now, inside this Ark is a relic of Atlantis itself."
The Torch of Truth.
Where is the director with his key to open the blasted display case?
"Uh, professor,"
Kelly discovered something you might want to--
Professor Atticus.
I've just been on the phone to the Balkan Embassy.
They say that you and Mr. MacGyver are thieves.
"Oh, do you hear that, MacGyver?"
"First we are spies, now we are thieves."
"They claim the Ark is a national treasure, and demand its return."
You can't return it to those butchers.
It belongs to the world.
You have no say in the matter.
"I'll remind you, Professor Atticus, that you no longer work here."
"Oh, Mr. Director, this Ark contains the missing link to Atlantis, an unknown chapter in history."
If you'll just open the display case and let us get hold of that medallion.
"Excuse me, can I see that?"
The medallion's magnetic.
"Yeah, so's the Ark."
A magnetic lock and key.
Impossible.
The people of Solon's time had no concept of the physics of magnetism.
"Ah, but legend says the people of Atlantis did, and Solon somehow must have learned it from them."
Pure speculation.
Ha-ha-ha!
You won't think so when you see what's inside this Ark.
"That's it, this is it."
This is it.
It works.
"It works, it works."
"Oh, after all these years, MacGyver."
"For a man pushing 100, you're amazingly well preserved."
How accommodating of the Society to provide members with rejuvenation drugs.
You should see the dental plan.
"(Malone) We've been aware of you for some time, Detective."
"Despite all the roadblocks we've thrown in your path, you've managed to persevere."
"- Yeah, I'm funny that way."
- You are impressive that way.
What if I told you the Society might be willing to offer you membership?
Provided you pass a loyalty test.
You want me to prove my good faith?
How will you prove yours?
With a bit of information.
Courtesy of David Xanatos - one of our lower-echelon members.
You've got my attention.
You OK?
Our shift's almost over and you haven't said three words all night.
Let... me... drive.
"- Hey, pal, it's my car."
- I insist.
All I could think about was what Elisa had told me.
"I was feeling hurt, betrayed and, most of all, angry."
Make sure you buckle up.
(tires squeal)
I saw Malone today.
The old man had a lot to say - not just about the Illuminati.
"Uh, that's great, but easy on the gas, OK?"
He told me I knew someone who could blow the lid off another conspiracy.
One a lot closer to home.
"Matt, slow down!"
This is nuts.
"This is the end, Elisa."
The end of all the lies and deception.
- What are you going to do?
Wait!
"Sorry, I didn't want to make you wait."
"No, no, I arrived early."
- Are you alright?
- Well...
"Sorry, really..."
"Don't worry, maybe there's still time, let's go..."
- Febo!
- Sorry to meet you here.
We're conducting a study on extreme wounds.
We needed test subjects.
To learn how to treat battle wounds.
These were stray dogs.
They would have been killed anyway.
Febo...
"It's not allowed, but I'll put it to sleep."
"It's a sweet, painless sleep."
Why this dreadful silence?
We anesthetize them.
"Don't worry, Mrs. Wyatt, nothing is gonna fall from the ceiling."
We eat here every day.
It is an honor to have a young American guest with us.
Thanks.
The U.S. Army has the same stimulating aroma... as a summer rain in the woods.
Maybe it's the woods still in you.
"It's the way the wind blows, I'm sure."
It's the only occupation army in the history of Naples... that had the courtesy of knocking on our doors... before coming in.
"Judging by the ruins I saw, I think we knocked too strongly."
"That, dear, is an insignificant detail."
"If one has to lose a war, Mrs Wyatt... it is better to be conquered by an army... that has good manners, believe me."
The Duchess is still recovering... from the Barbarian's raid into Imperial Rome.
Huh?
- Roderick.
- Mr. Porter.
It is all part of the treatment.
"- Roderick, it's all right, it's all right."
Can I speak to my brother in private for a moment?
- I'll be right here if you need me.
"- Okay, thank you."
"Brother, do not worry."
Everything is fine.
"Wonderful, in fact."
Dr. Cairn made me understand that the root cause of my ailment is decadence.
"But I just feel so much more relaxed, and lighter even, just being around all these women who've truly embraced their healing."
"- Isabel, please!"
I can't follow a word you're saying.
"In fact, I think it'd be best if you came home."
- No.
I have to stay until I'm healed.
- Of what?
!
What sort of nonsense are they feeding you?
"- I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you're afraid of what you don't understand, but I will not be leaving with you."
"Good day, brother."
- Isa...
- I'm afraid it's gonna be a while before Isabel's ready to receive another visit.
- That is not for you to decide.
"- Mr. Porter, visits are made at the discretion of our patients."
So we will let you know the next time your presence is requested here at Rosewood.
"Good day, Mr. Porter."
"""Detective Thomas..."
"""I implore you to consider an investigation into Rosewood."""
- I'm going to put you in restraints.
What did he say?
We will attend.
It'll be the finest concert ever to be held here.
Of course I'll pay for the ferry tickets on Sunday.
Rolf and Knut will pick you up by car tonight.
Just the three of you.
Four guards on the pier.
"Most likely there won't be any guards on the ferry,   but the ferry crew members sometimes sleep there."
The raft is positioned a quarter of a mile from the dock.
"It's no problem getting there unseen,   but from the raft to the ferry, that's risky."
My neighbor will be on the ferry.
- You asked me to change the departure because so many people traveled on Friday.
- I know...
- You can't warn him now.
- It's his entire family!
Makes no difference.
Do you understand the consequences?
- You know someone on the ferry as well?
- Could be.
- Don't you think about that?
- I've been ordered not to.
- They are innocent people!
- And?
"We have gotten an order, so someone must have considered it."
We save more people by sinking the ferry.
- Is it really that simple for you?
"- Yes, it's that simple."
What if I warn him?
I didn't hear that.
Get up in the highlands and make contact with England.
There you await new orders.
I'll see you there in two days.
- No.
What is your verdict?
Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
"Your, erm, dinner invitation."
- You're a married man.
- This is it.
I think Danny Waldron purposely created a trail of evidence and now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
Dale Roach.
He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.
The things that he did to us at Sands View...
"I promise you, I will get these bastards."
Bains killed Danny.
I'll lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.
- Hello?
- 'You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.'
"If you want a way out, you'll listen to me."
Did he ever mention any other names?
Politicians?
Coppers?
Single-handedly brings in an AFO.
Well done.
'I'd just like to get on with my life.'
Miss Denton.
"I'm Gill Bigelow, legal counsel to AC-12."
I imagine they keep you VERY busy.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As part of a new initiative, christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
"regina just left,"
Which is probably a good thing
Considering how she's been acting these days.
"Yeah, i just saw her flying out of the house for her morning jog."
"I called after her, but she just kept running."
- Oh.
- Kind of like she does in life in general.
"Georgia: well, she probably couldn't hear you"
Because she's got on her ipod.
It's a good thing she got out of here when she did.
Things were getting a little heated in here.
- What happened?
"- Well, we had a little tiff"
About regina and her taste for the good life.
"Well, that's nothing new."
I meant what happened to all the furniture?
"Oh, i'm not surprised that she didn't tell you."
She lost her job
About six months ago.
- What?
"- She's broke,"
Stubborn and won't let me help her.
And they repossessed her car too.
And today we got a foreclosure notice on the house.
"Now i've gotta do something,"
Because i am not going to be homeless
Because of her bad decisions.
"Well, i was coming over to tell her some good news,"
But i guess she won't be in the mood to appreciate it.
"Oh, give it to me, because i do need it."
"But just don't tell me you found a new woman,"
Because that won't be good news for her or me.
Yes.
Then you will be familiar with informationals.
"We sandwich them between the support and the main features for the public to be informed, don't have time to escape."
What to do in an air-raid?
Get under-cover at once.
Don't stand staring at the sky.
Take cover at once!
"You will find a page of script equates to a minute of screen time, or roughly 80 yards or celluloid, or... the word of directors who didn't squander the film stock as if it were lavatory paper."
"Speaking of which, ""ladies"" is last door on the left."
I wouldn't risk the other facilities if I were you.
I thought it was a Secretarial post.
For God sake!
Keep that to yourself.
This way!
This way!
This way!
What did they say!
?
The War Artist Committee?
They find my interpretations all together too brutal and dis-spirited.
You're so much better than the all the rest of them.
"All the rest of them, managed to put food on the table."
"Ellis, I had a meeting today."
About a new job.
They offered it to me. £2 a week.
You know Perry wants you to work for him.
I told him only I'm allowed to blame you.
You are me for my perspective.
No.
"They are puttin' him, cause they want you there."
Right.
I've to get to the warden's fast.
Stop it!
"Stop it, stop it."
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
- You're condoning this?
!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
That'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom.
Hyperalgesia.
The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
"His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing."
Suit up.
Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
"No, but maybe... maybe what?"
"Maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?"
And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
"God, you're weak."
Guy steals your article... tells you you're not his friend... and you still want to risk your life for him.
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
"God, you're weak."
Guy tried to kill you.
First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.
No.
"And you think he'd be just a little bit grateful, show some appreciation for my personal growth."
He only listens to Kirsten and Sandy.
"Well, the woman I married wouldn't stand for that."
Nobody puts Julie Cooper in the corner.
I don't know how this is happening again.
- Maybe 'cause you keep marrying for money?
- I did not marry for money.
"- Well, I didn't marry you for money."
"- No, you married me because you were pregnant."
You married me because I was pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.
"- Bye, Dad."
"- Bye, sweetheart."
- Love you.
"- I love you, too."
Back to the gulag.
"Oh, KE equals one half MB squared."
"So if gravity is the constant, and we plug in these velocities..."
"- Ryan, what are you doing?"
- Trying to do the assignment.
- Except you've already finished it.
"- If you flunk out of Harvard, you can spend the rest of your life floating in your paren"
"- I need an academic scholarship, so..."
"- Okay, what makes you think my parents have an infinity pool?"
"I mean, they do, but they're not my parents."
I transferred in from Chino last year.
- I was just like you.
- Really?
You were assaulted by the Captain of the water polo team.
"Okay, first of all, I've never even seen a water polo game, match, whatever."
"Second of all, yeah, I was."
"Bye, marcus."
Oh lord...
Thank you for my granddaughter.
"Oh please,"
Let her make a fresh start
And let it stick this time.
This whole family needs a fresh start.
And send my silly daughter home to her husband.
"Lord, if i'd have had one like him,"
I wouldn't have had to raise my girls alone.
"Well, monica, it's time for your evaluation."
"You know jack, of course, and this is mr."
Charles.
And we're just gonna evaluate you today.
"I know this can be scary, but please just try to relax."
We all want you to be able to leave the center.
We do.
We just want to be sure you can do that without coming back here.
Our main concern is where you'll be staying
If your mother won't let you back into her house.
"Well, my dad said that i could stay at his house."
He said i'm...
I'm welcome there.
"Well, that's great."
That's wonderful.
"But he travels a lot, so who's gonna be there to monitor you,"
Make sure you don't get back with the same people and end up here again?
"Yeah, that just doesn't seem too stable to me."
"I would like to hear of a better plan, for your protection."
We're just not sure that you're ready
For that much freedom yet.
I'll be fine.
Then getting around the town as well is not good either.
"Well, the bridge is the problem, isn't it?"
"Yes, the bridge is hopeless, it goes off several times a day."
The long-term future has to be to sort the infrastructure out.
NEWSREEL:
Increased activities in the dock has highlighted a problem...
The bridge!
"For generations, it has divided the town."
NEWSREEL:
"This is the real source of the problem, the town's harbour bridge."
"When it is raised to allow a ship to pass, everything stops."
It divides this small town.
It can take an hour to get from one side of it to the other.
"To use a bridge as a metaphor for hope might seem a bit obvious, a bit trite."
But it works.
Bridges get you to where you want to go.
"At least that, is the theory."
"Well, that's it."
"Nothing can go across it and even as I speak, the traffic is starting to build-up."
There's a lot of frustration out there.
We need a new bridge!
And a new A12!
Otherwise what happens?
We've got no work!
You blame that on the bridge?
Yes!
It goes up.
Who wants to bring a factory here when you have got to wait - this is going up-and-down all the time?
You need a new crossing?
We do.
Desperately.
"The Labour politician, the"
You know?
Can i call my parents in nebraska?
I just--I want to warn them
About all the stuff on the news before they see it.
Sorry.
"Till we turn you in,"
We can't risk letting anyone know you're here.
Trial lawyers have great hearing.
It comes from trying to hear what jurors are whispering about.
Where exactly did you meet stein?
We met through prime match...at hyde.
This is bad.
"They're gonna say ann's a prostitute,"
"Or as they say in hollywood, a ""strategic dater""--"
A girl who goes out with a rich man
Because he gives her nice things.
What are you talking about?
Prime match is this dating service
That throws parties at clubs like hyde.
Women get in free to interact with rich men
Who pay for the privilege.
How do you know all this?
I've gone to the parties with my friends... rarely.
I just end up being the designated driver
And the one who saves them from bad situations like stein.
"If you ever went out, you'd know these things,tom."
"Well,did you know the dead guy,lenny stein?"
"No,but i know his type."
"I know ann's type,too."
She's a poor girl trying to live larger than she can afford.
"Yeah,well,she's not that poor."
You see her clothes tonight?
"How could a subject ignore the King's command, and how co n such insolent man be allowed to lead the military?"
"Your Majesty, criminal of high treason Yi Soon-shin must be executed!"
"Defending high treason is also high treason, hence there must be consequences for the Left Minister Yu Sung-ryong as well."
"No, Your Majesty!"
Sincere council cannot be confused with treason!
Are you trying break my will as well?
Your Majesty...
Leave!
Your Majesty!
I said leave!
Do not attempt to break my will!
Or you will be punished regardless of who you are!
How foolish they are!
If in excess even nectar is poison.
What do they think they can gain by acting like they care more about the country than the King?
His Majesty will forsake Yu Sung-ryong as well.
"The world is as good as yours now, Minister Yoon."
Not yet.
I need the two of you to fight the Japanese and win for me.
"You don't have to worry, Minister Yoon."
I am counting on you.
You had once admonished me telling me that the world hasn't changed.
Do you recall?
How about now?
Has the world changed now?
"No, Your Majesty."
Nothing has changed.
Where is the Left Minister?
Your Majesty...
Is he still by Yi Soon-shin's side?
"I'm afraid so, Your Majesty."
Minister Yu... the heavens will not forsake you.
She said she was going to.
I assumed she had.
Who's Gina Gilbert?
I don't--
She's a girl I know.
"Just a friend, that's all."
"She a friend of Merle's, too."
Objection.
"Your Honor, if counselor gets much farther afield, we'll--"
"I'll discontinue this line of questioning, Your Honor."
And I'm finished with this witness...
for the moment.
"You're excused, Mr. Pierce."
"Call your next witness, Mr. Burger."
Then I call Mr. Julian Kirk.
That's right.
My house is next door.
It was the guest house on the estate when my grandmother was alive.
She left it to me in her will.
Was that all she left you?
Some other odds and ends of property.
All the real money went to Olivia-- I mean Merle.
Then you were familiar with the situation that existed at the Langley house?
I was certainly aware of how completely Olivia dominated Merle.
It's not the girl's fault she's neurotic.
"Are you by any chance a trained psychiatrist, Mr. Kirk?"
"Well, no, but all you--"
Then you're certainly not qualified to judge the defendant's mental condition.
"Now, then, was your knowledge of the situation of the house next door based on personal observation?"
Mostly.
"But the chauffeur kept me informed, too."
Did you witness a quarrel between the defendant and her aunt a couple of days prior to the murder?
"Well, I'm sorry you took such a risk to hear bad news."
"Well, that isn't why I came."
I wanted to see how far the flood level's fallen.
Why?
"I had hoped we could tunnel in from the lower city and lay mines under the Magnetrix terminal, but the floodwater's too high."
"In the early days of the fighting, we blew the reservoirs."
The terminal is their communication centre?
"If we could knock it out, they'd be isolated."
Couldn't you infiltrate an assault group?
Or is it too heavily defended?
"It's not defended, but the city's sealed off."
- What is it?
- Sealed off.
About 100 years ago they sealed off the old monorail.
"Hunda, if you could find it..."
I know where it runs.
It's still shown on the plans.
You could bring an army in through there right into the heart of the city.
You're right.
We could destroy the terminal and their command HQ in one strike.
We'll win this war yet!
I must get back to my column.
I don't think we'll meet again.
I hope you get the information you need.
"- Oh, and, Leitz."
- Yes?
Remember to keep your head down when we come in.
What's the information you need?
We've come to learn what we can about the new drug the Federation's using.
Pylene-50.
What do you want to know?
(Alarm beeping)
-No.
In the end you're living at Pablo's home.
-In my house.
I don't care who's the owner.
"If you'd analyze your behavior with me or Pablo, you'd realize the deep reason..."
-Don't start with your theories!
You live completely apart from them.
You've made up a character and your buying it.
How is that character to you?
-A victim of the society.
"An idealist, full of altruism."
"And actually you're selfish, dominant, maniac..."
And sometimes miserable like everyone else!
I think you haven't missed anything.
Of course I have!
Or do you think it's easy to put up with someone teaching everyone?
Is it better for you to act irrationally?
A bit of that irrationalism could be good for you.
I don't want to keep arguing about this!
It'll be better if we don't see each other for a couple of days.
I've been wanting to tell you that for a while.
It'll be better if we don't meet ever again.
I see you've thought about it.
Yes.
Then I agree.
I'm sorry to tell you this while arguing.
It's absurd to argue at this point.
There's something true in what you say.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
It's something I'm always thinking.
Why did you came here the first night?
- Where is Swami?
"""We do not know.-Why, did'nt you see him fighting with Lord Shiv?"""
"""Y es, but they vanished suddenly while fighting. """
Maybe Shiv has finished him with his power
"""Till I am sacred, nobody can harm my husband in anyway."""
"""Fighting continuously with Lord Shiv, when Jalandhar became..."""
"""...weak  tired, it was natural for him to get worried."""
Shri Hari was also serious and worried by Ma Parvati's queries.
Mother Lakshmi asked him the reason of his worry.
"""Swami, what is your worry?"
"-Devi Parvati has put me..."""
"""...in a religious dilemma?"
"-What is that, Swami?"""
"""Don't ask me, it is better to keep quiet now, you will learn..."""
"""...everything when the time comes, Devi?"""
Please tell me what is your dilemma?
-Don't be stubborn.
"""l am only requesting you, Swami."
"-Don't do that also."""
"""lf a wife does'nt know his husband's problem, is that not..."""
...a dilemma for her?
-I can only tell you that this problem related with Jalandhar and his wife Brinda
- Swami!
"""ls nothing is known about my Swami!"
"-No, queen!"""
"""We searched our soldiers to ask about king, but no one was..."""
...found and nothing has been known about our King.
"""Queen, we have searched everywhere, he was not there..."""
"""...anywhere."
"- But, did'nt you get any messages also?"""
"""Got a news, but can't be told before you  you can't bear to..."""
"""...hear it."
"Brothers, what's your opinion?"
We'll obey our chief!
"Fung-wu, why did you kill your master?"
I'm innocent!
"Those that have broken our regulations must be locked in the closet, no matter how senior he is."
But my master...
"Before I leave here, I hope you learn patience."
I knew your master well.
He was a friend.
"Fung-wu, I promise you I'll see what I can do."
Thanks!
His Highness has initiated a competition between Shaolin and Wu-tang to elect the ruler of the martial arts world.
Which chamber should be our representative?
"I think among the various chambers, the Four Escorts are our best fighters."
I think the Pine Crane Chamber is enough.
Yes... enough!
"You're a senior, and your kung-fu is acknowledged to be the best."
Your 8-divine sword is superb now.
You'll surely win!
"Yes, we'll win!"
Yes... we'll win!
This contest is to see who will be supreme chief.
It decides the destiny of Wu-tang.
We can't underestimate Shaolin.
What you mean is?
Monk Wo-tao will be out tomorrow.
I think we better let him decide.
Shaolin Chin Kang Fist requires great speed.
It attacks the enemy at all his vital points.
8-divine Sword may not be able to counter it.
And your opinion is?
"Unless we can understand the Chin Kang Fist, we'll lose and bring disgrace to Wu-tang."
If you can help your neighbor light that at the other end.
(coughing)
Oh!
Who's next?
We're about to go into a... into a dispensary.
Is this it?
Is this the...
"Oh, okay."
Okay.
I'm off to the dispensary.
We are much further along than I ever imagined us to be.
Morris:
Andrew Freedman is the Director of Marijuana coordination in the Colorado governor's office.
Freedman:
There are more dispensaries than there are Starbucks.
"We estimated the size of the industry in its first year to be about 700 million, and now we think it tops one billion dollars as an annual revenue source."
What makes this massage different?
This massage is different because our massage cream is infused with THC and CBD.
"All right, I think I'll try the extra strength."
Great choice.
Is that pressure okay?
Yeah.
Morris:
"Maybe it was the extra strength THC oil, but I started to wonder, where is all this weed coming from?"
I'm standing in what may be Colorado's largest cannabis grow operation.
"It's so enormous,"
I can't even see the edges of the room from where I'm standing.
Look at what we've created here.
"I mean, is this something?"
"This is John Seckman, the COO of LivWell."
This is the most exciting thing I've ever done.
"It's a business, and it's a new exciting business."
I don't know enough about her abilities.
- There's plenty for her to do back here.
"- I don't know what she's capable of either, but we've got to find out sooner or later."
"It's an interrogation, not a training exercise."
She's the only member of the team fluent in arabic.
- There are other translators.
"- Yeah, but they haven't studied behavior."
She ever have her ready bag yet?
My guess is there isn't much this woman's unprepared for.
Car leaves in 4 minutes.
"Yes, sir."
Dale Turner mused:
"""Some of the best lessons are learned from past mistakes."
"The error of the past is the wisdom of the future."""
"Excuse me, sir."
I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate... do not thank me.
- Sir?
- It's not a favor.
- Of course.
I know that.
- You're coming to do a job.
Do you think the interrogation of Jind Allah will work in time?
Interrogation's the most dynamic form of profiling.
That's not an answer.
Sir.
He's been locked away in Gitmo.
He doesn't know we raided the cell's safe house.
That's an advantage for us.
The main thing is to get him talking about anything.
Then his language and body movements will betray him.
It's like this- you focus on the way your opponent holds his piece.
How quickly and firmly he places it.
Back to your places now.
Guess how much the Camembert was.
"- I don,t know."
Five francs?
- 4.35.
"Where,d you get it?"
I got that...
"Have you seen my tape, wolfgang?"
Where the hell did I put that damn tape?
And he plays Mr. Nice Guy!
"He only wants to be the object of positive transference and affection, and I get all the negativity!"
Give me a break!
Know what your problem is?
"At first you wanted to be the aII-powerfuI phaIIic mother manipulating love and hate, but you never responded to their demands for love and bonding because you couldn,t stand being part of the very tests you reject."
Your subconscious spilled over into your work.
"You swayed the experiment in the couple,s favor by being aggressive, because deep down you no Ionger want to be a ,tool, a mere ,technician,!"
"You always oversimpIify, sweetie."
"It,s much more complicated."
What if I was doing it on purpose from the start?
Right!
What did I do with that tape?
Did I erase it?
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, good morning!"
"I,II be showing you some images, and I,d like to know whether, if the thing or person shown disappeared, you,d be happier, less happy, or indifferent."
"Happier, less happy, or indifferent."
Okay.
If what?
"If the person disappeared, would you be happier or less happy?"
Ready?
Here we go.
Happier.
Happier.
Because it's a murder weapon.
They'll convict her based on her trying to hide it.
"So let's find it before they do, turn it over to the cops"
And show the jury she has nothing to hide.
"Just do it fast, before the next news cycle."
"Luther,you're an ex-D.A."
How long do we have before they identify ann?
Depends.
"Police have a composite drawing,"
Which means they can't put a name to a face yet.
By now they have picked over the scene
"And found her fingerprints,"
And they're entering them into their master database.
"If she had a record, they'd know who she is now."
"The good news is,she doesn't."
"The bad news is, with her driver's license,"
"Passport and her student loan application,"
They'll know who she is by morning.
Fine.
We can do a lot in one night.
"Yeah,like make our case worse."
Nothing says we have to find the knife.
What if we decide not to go with self-Defense after all?
Stein's wife was in paris.
"We can't blame her,"
"And this doesn't look like suicide,"
So it's self-Defense or nothing.
"Find the knife,now."
Think.
"When you left the hotel, did you go left or right?"
"Uh,i don't remember where i threw it."
I--It was an alley.
- No.
And here it is.
"Okay, great."
We'll take it in together.
"Like you said, we have deal, right?"
"Oh, so now the deal's back on?"
Austin:
Drop the knife!
"Austin, the police know we're here."
"If you kill us, they will catch you."
I'm not gonna kill you.
Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?
Because you're robbing me?
We're not robbing you.
We're getting evidence that you are a serial killer.
"Like this knife, which as been used in seven ritualistic murders."
What are you talking about?
I-I'm not a serial killer.
I'm a film director.
And that is a prop from a horror movie I shot two years ago.
"Well, prop or not, this knife matches our victims' wounds exactly."
"There were five identical knives made for that film, which means there are four others out there just like it."
Maybe you should be looking for one of those.
But you were in New York for three of those murders.
"So were 8 million other people, including my assistant, who can prove my whereabouts at all times."
Now get the hell out of my house!
- Do you think you could...
- Hey.
Okay.
"Well, the director was telling the truth."
His alibis check out for all three New York murders.
Then we need to track down all the knives that were made for that horror movie.
We're already seeking permission to exhume the body.
Thanks.
We'll be taking this from here.
- We've got an ongoing...
- It's ours now.
We'll keep you in the loop as best we can.
It seems like you're in everybody's good books.
'Ticket number 41.'
Do you know how long I've been waiting?
- You need to complete the form.
- I've done all the forms!
- You're taking the piss!
- Lindsay?
- Yeah.
My name's Tammy.
I'm one of the multi-disciplinary offender management team.
- Is this your first appointment?
- Yep.
I'm ready to restart my life...
Lovely.
.. by rejoining the police service.
Bollocks to this!
"Er... it says here that you were acquitted of conspiracy to murder, but found guilty of perverting the course of justice."
"Yes, I'm appealing against the conviction."
I'm going to clear my name.
You won't be able to rejoin the police with a criminal conviction.
"I told you, I'm appealing."
Have you actually checked to see that I can rejoin?
"No, I haven't checked."
"Well, then, I would like to apply to rejoin the police service."
"I'm sorry, why are you looking at me like that?"
"Lindsay, I don't know you, I've got nothing against you, but I can't help you if you're going to be in denial."
95th Rifles.
Only a lieutenant?
Perhaps they do not promote you because you fight with your men?
"That man is a mutineer, sir."
He'll be taken back to Lisbon and shot.
"Tongue, tie him up and take him to the barn."
"Spain and England, we are allies."
TERESA What are you doing here?
"Don't tell me a stupid lie about being lost 100 miles behind French lines, Lieutenant."
We're looking for the village of Casa Antigua.
That is all I can tell you.
"If you were French, I would take a knife and you would tell me all I wanted to know."
But we are allies.
Allies?
Do allies keep secrets from each other?
"Lovers keep secrets from each other, yet they still make love."
Er...
Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other
That is what allies are for.
Good.
"I'm on my way north to the town of Torrecastro, carrying important documents from my government to those who resist the French."
"The village of Casa Antigua is on our way north, so we can travel together... under my command."
I thought she was in command?
Teresa is seeing us safely through the mountains
Now'm the senior officer here
Do you agree to travel under my command?
Yeah.
OTHER MEN Yean
- I think your men agree.
You ask your men what to do?
Yes.
"I don't always do it, but I ask."
The intention.
I propose to remain a professional soldier when this war is over.
I propose to remain a professional soldier when this war is over.
"Than the men you're fighting, it's as simple as that."
"Now, this morning you make your first jump from an aircraft."
"Are you aware that parachuting, is described as dicing with death in the sky."
It's a revolting phrase and quite apart from that it's grossly untrue.
"Parachuting, in any case, is just a means to an end."
"It gets you into battle, no more."
"After that, you're an ordinary soldier."
Now remember that.
You're soldiers not stuntmen.
To get your wings you'll do seven jumps.
"After that, you'll jump whenever ordered."
A refusal means 84 days detention and your wings stripped off in front of the Colonel.
"So if any of you has any idea that he doesn't want any part of this, now is the time to say so."
It's no disgrace either.
Not now.
Good.
Carry on.
Sir.
"All yours, Mr Aldridge."
"Split, on left, turn!"
"Left-right, march!"
"Left, right, left, right..."
What was that?
The engine changed its noise.
I means the pilot's throttling back.
"Yes, that means we've got to get ready."
Prepare for action.
"Nothing to it, my lads."
88 jumps I've had and loved every one of them.
"And we dipped his banner in the blood and cried ot ""Sant'lago"
Child of thunder!
"Child of battle!"""
The gonfalon.
"The banner of blood, kept in my family for 1,000 years, lest we needed Sant'lago to keep his promise."
"What promise, Major?"
"His promise that he would come again if Spain were invaded, as soon as we raise his banner"
- over the cape of Torrecastro
"- Get to the point, Major."
There's only a small French garrison in Torrecastro.
"The people of the town know the legend, secretly believe it."
"As soon as we raise the banner over the little chapel, the people will rise up against the French invader."
Rise up?
For a rag on a pole?
"Are you mad, Major?"
"No, it's a legend, Mr Sharpe."
The people believe in it.
"As soon as the gonfalon is unfurled,"
Sant'lago will surely come with fire and sword.
But it takes time to raise the banner.
And before it is unfurled...
The French will come with the sabre.
Exactly
That's why we need you.
Will you help us fight off the French long enough to raise the banner?
"You lied to us, Major."
"And you, Miss."
"You picked us up and we marched with you, fought for you."
And for what?
For a stupid superstition.
For a... for a rag in a bag.
"Not a rag, but the last flag of Spain."

Where can we find a lot of humans?
It doesn't look tasty.
THE FOX FAMILY
"Today at 7 PM, not far from the scene where a woman was axed..."
- Sir!
"- You did it, before."
"Nobody can come here, and don't touch anything."
"Since we came down too soon without adapting to humans, there was a slight mistake earlier."
"In one month, it will finally be the 1000th year."
"A month will be enough, right?"
We came down too early.
"Yeah, we've already prepared for 1000 years."
"When the sun and the moon meet, and the four pillars of the year, month, day, and time join together... 30 minutes."
"When the sun and the moon align as one for those 30 minutes, our fate will be decided."
Our chance only comes...
Only once.
If you fail...
There will never be another chance.
Never forget that!
"Planned to say that, right?"
But you said a bunch of humans will come if we perform a circus.
"Yeah, and only kids came."
Disappointed that you can't mate?
What's the use if only kids come?
They all run away.
"To catch and eat humans, we need to be more active and bold."
Isn't that the way to look for humans?
You're too passive.
You son of bitch!
"Darling, ever since you passed away,"
I've tried hard to make real people out of our kids.
When you saw us duck down the alley you knew we was headed to the hideout.
- I took the old shortcut.
- What do they call you?
- Soapy's the name.
He's Bim.
This mug here's Swing.
This palooka up here's Hunky.
"- Hi, Rocky."
What's left of her remains have been in here over a week.
You might wanna use the vapo rub.
Let's hope the rest of her is in there.
Resting in pieces.
Someone at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office sandbagged us.
"Yeah, I'll bet his name is Mark Mogan."
"Look, man, I just process them and ship them."
Does that process include leaving your semen in Manette Combs' severed throat?
"- No, that's insane."
- So is raping the dead.
"You know abusing a corpse is a crime, Mark?"
I never abused anybody.
Three dozen unclaimed bodies you processed and shipped are being exhumed right now.
- Why?
- To see what's in the caskets.
What's it gonna be?
Some more violated corpses or just more beanie bodies.
"Listen, it's not what you're thinking."
"Oh, you have no idea what I'm thinking."
I was performing a public service.
"Yeah, even the dead need a little loving."
I only took junkies and bums.
"They didn't contribute anything to the world while they were living, so I helped them contribute a little after they died."
- By chopping them up?
What'd you pick him up for?
Because he was a potential suspect the Vincent Nelson homicide and we wanted to ask him questions about his relationship with Mr. Nelson.
And what was the subject's physical condition when you first saw him?
Nothing unusual.
Maybe he was a little nervous.
Cops make some people nervous.
- But basically he was fine?
- Yes.
"- No cuts, no bruises,o scrapes?"
- No.
What about the abrasion on the side of his head?
He walk in with that?
"During the interview, he grew agitated."
Started flailing around.
I had to restrain him.
"When I let go, he slipped and fell off the chair."
17-year-old boys don't just slip and fall and then drop dead.
And they also don't require a guardian to be present during questioning.
So maybe you gave him a little push.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
"If you want my statement, G.O.15 me."
I want my union attorney.
2 days ago
Flying tomato over here took a dip in the garbage while he was snowboarding.
Landed right next to the foot.
The rest of the body?
We're canvassg garbage receptacles in the area.
The city only picks up trash once a week on account of the budget cuts.
This place is turning into a cesspool.
Look what I found.
It's got dried blood all over it.
Show me your first letter.
"For five points, let's see if you're correct."
"Yes, indeed,"
"Mendeleev, who created a periodic table of elements in 1869, Mendel after Gregor Mendel, father of genetics."
Tell me what was so brilliant about Mendeleev.
"Not only did he create a periodic table, but also..."
Is it the fact that he left gaps for unknown elements?
"Exactly, he was such a genius that he left gaps, he knew that there were things he didn't know, that there were properties he didn't know but he did actually suggest what those properties could be,"
he left five gaps and three of them later were discovered.
"Gallium, scandium, germanium."
There we go.
"Lutrophiles, over to you, you are looking for..."
Reveal the hive.
Erotica.
Have you found it?
Yes.
That was so quick.
Your answer?
Eroica.
Eroica.
Show me your first letter.
Let's see if you're right.
"So, Eroica,"
"Beethoven's Third Symphony and Erotica, one of Madonna's more memorable albums, forgettable albums, what do we think?"
It does have that song about Bill Oddie.
Does it?
Yes.
"It's a mondegreen, it's not actually what it is..."
"""Bill Oddie, Bill Oddie, put your hands all over my body..."""
Oh...
THEY LAUGH
"Well done, you got the full five points for that, so, so far, Lutrophiles, you're in the lead with eight."
"When their valuables are being broken, he is getting angry."
Doubt No. 4..
- Mr. Ratnam...
Madam..
- Stop it now.
Something is wrong.
"Everything is wrong, madam."
You go their marriage anniversary party in the night.
Observe whether they are real husband and wife or not.
We had to commit that psycho as husband as you slipped your tongue then.
Now we are having to continue that as you slipped the file.
"Can't avoid sir, as it is our need."
"But, that fellow should not put his hands on him."
"Why do you feel her as your wife, sir?"
"She is just your Facebook friend, right?"
"- Whoever it may be but she is a lady, right?"
"Fine, you keep watching in the web cam."
I will control the over action of that mental fellow.
Go and somehow catch that jackass.
"I will handle him, you go and make your Facebook friend agree first."
"Impossible, I cannot tolerate his torture."
He is just disgusting.
"Please Malini, Vasu got a doubt."
Please co-operate this once.
Fine..
This better be the last time.
This is the last time.
Thank you so much Malini.
"Brother-in-law, he confused me like a new app in the morning."
Now I got a grip.
I will squash it like Candy Crush.
"If they does any extras, will mix cocaine in the Coke, they will die in coma."
Yeah.
I guess he does.
Thanks for being there for me.
"Your Grandad's waiting for you, love."
OK.
"Laters, George."
All the best for today.
You sure you don't want us to come?
"No, we'll keep it just family."
"I'll see you at the after-match though, eh?"
Absolutely.
You OK?
Yeah.
"Actually, I... ..I'm better than I've been in a long time."
"Life goes on, eh?"
Someone's busy.
Just finishing my editorial.
"OK, and what's it about?"
You'll have to wait and see.
"Ooh, fighting talk!"
"Hey, you better scoot or you're going to be late for that press conference."
What press conference?
"I've called you all here today to announce that our extensive investigation into the crash that caused the death of Trina Joy McNamara has concluded, and we have determined that Mrs McNamara died on September 12, 2008 after leaving the road in a storm on her way back to Weld."
Are there any questions?
"Yes, Mr Turner?"
Has foul play definitely been ruled out?
Absolutely.
The idea of anyone tampering with Trina's car so it fortuitously drove off a cliff in a storm is the stuff of films.
And it was definitely a stormy night when the accident happened?
"Ah, there are some suggestions that it was overcast but possibly verging on storming."
Next question?
And she was definitely returning to Weld?
really?
"You know, Jean-MicheI, we question these things too."
constantly.
"With a degree in psychosocioIogy, what are our options?"
"One is the System, with a capital S:"
"marketing or advertising and a fat paycheck, and lots of what you call manipulation."
Another is the system with a lowercase S:
"research, academia, and places like this, the Ministry of the Future."
What should we do?
"- Okay, I get it."
"Raise sheep in the boonies, or join the system to throw a monkey wrench in it?"
"What we,re really interested in, what I care about, is how perverse the social sciences can be."
"For exampIe, we both used to work in an asylum."
"We changed quite a few things, even on an everyday level."
"We don,t want to make problems."
"Check ,happy.,"
"I,II check whatever you Iike."
"I just don,t understand why you refused to cooperate."
"We didn,t."
It just felt like you expected a certain answer.
"That,s right!"
What answer?
"I don,t know."
"Why isn,t there a box for ,fairly happy,?"
"We have ,mostly happy, don,t we?"
"It,s not the same!"
"We can,t have dozens of options."
"If we say ,fairly happy, which box do you check?"
This is all quibbIing over words.
"It,s just a check box, not The Brothers Karamazov!"
"That option isn,t offered."
"It,s a pity, but that,s how it is."
When they try to take your picture?
All our cover is blown.
"An entire race, hidden for millennia, exposed by your weakness."
"Oh, come on."
I'd never get arrested.
I know what to do.
Clearly not.
Which is why the Old Ones contacted me.
"They want you to join them in South America, and they've asked me to organise transit."
You'll travel with my next shipment.
Keep these papers with you and they'll guarantee your safe passage.
"The details are all inside under some, er... cash for emergencies."
"Oh, and while on board, you are not, I repeat not, to touch any of my carpets."
"Oh, wait, wait a second."
I'm not an Old One.
I'm 117.
You are the most wanted man in the country.
Hardly the time to quibble about your age.
"But once I'm there, there's no coming back, right?"
"No, well, why would you want to, eh?"
Come back to this?
!
"Desperation, debauchery, on the fringe of society?"
A slave to your lust and hunger?
"You know, there's nothing funnier than a vampire taking the moral high ground."
"Underneath the driving gloves and the business cards, we're all the same, brother."
"Oh, let me make this clear."
We are not the same.
I am not a servant to my condition.
I have systems in place that allow me to feed without this carnage.
You are weak.
You are craven.
- Where were you when he was killed?
- I had to meet somebody on the concourse.
So the killer could have seen you leave and knew he was alone.
"It's possible, sir."
"Of course, you can prove you had this meeting."
That might be difficult.
Why?
"Because my meeting was with Hunda, General, and two off-worlders."
Hunda is a rebel leader.
Yes.
He managed to get into the city.
"You see, since I arrived here, I've been coordinating the resistance."
I've kept in contact with all the rebel columns.
"This is treason, Leitz."
I could have you shot out of hand.
"No, I don't think so."
I was acting under Commissioner Sleer's instructions to obtain advanced knowledge of their plans.
You mean you're a double spy.
It was my information which led to the destruction of their second column.
And Hunda's column is about to walk into a similar trap.
Go on.
He's planning a raid on the Magnetrix terminal.
At dawn he'll enter the city by the old monorail.
"Once his column's inside the tunnel, all you have to do is blow it in, General."
Blow it in.
That's all I have to do?
"Yes, I suppose so."
It'll finish the resistance.
You mentioned two off-worlders at this meeting.
Yes.
They're interested in the adaptation drug.
I sent them to the laboratory.
Then you best keep traveling.
Yeah.
All right.
Wait.
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
It may not even start tonight.
It's been three months.
How much longer do you think it'll wait?
Hi.
What are you talking about?
The Daimos.
Never heard of it.
It lives in the forest.
It'll be feeding soon.
"And it is, what, some kind of an animal, or... it's a creature."
"It has the appearance of a man, but it can suck the very life from your bones."
Leaves only a dead withered husk behind.
Sounds familiar.
Stargate Atlantis
"Look, we know you're not used to dealing with strangers, but we may be able to help you with this little problem you're having."
We're used to dealing with this kind of thing.
We call them the wraith.
These are the creatures from the old stories?
From the time of the cullings?
So you have heard of them.
"Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete."
"They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky, but there's no description of the wraith themselves, although there were a few among us who guessed that Daimos might be one of them."
Why?
"Because it, too, came from the sky."
It was about 10 years ago.
A bright light appeared above the village... crashed into the hills.
don't you think?
But it wouldn't be enough to save this country.
we'll need some significant casualties so that the entire world can rally to our aid.
Juiz?
Tsuji.
Casualties are the missing piece of this puzzle.
we live in an era where you can sue for spilling coffee on yourself.
"So you get your ""sacrifice"" ticket punched and hop on that famous last train."
We can't have all those NEETs resting on their laurels go to waste.
Let's put 'em outta their misery.
Tsuji.
It sends a chill up my spine.
Hell yeah.
The PM's son returns wearing an Air King shirt.
Japan's headed straight towards militarism again and he'll have all of them seeing red.
Iinuma Akira will be shaming the Japanese and everyone else.
Tsuji.
I pray you continue to act as a cutting-edge savior.
But how will you get him to wear the shirt?
"I bet that's the ""golden ring"" you were talking about."
I went and looked it up after you said that.
Japanese merry-go-rounds never had them to begin with.
but anything built up to the late 80s would still have it.
the ride keeps going.
Makes sense.
I'd probably know that.
Whiff.
Over already?
I'll watch from the bench.
When did you-?
maybe I spent the whole time watching movies... not the movie theater.
stretching out to grab the golden ring.
The police said there was an accident.
Somebody tried to carjack them?
"Yeah, they're doing well."
"Come on, I'll take you to them."
Aren't you two supposed to keep 50 feet apart or something.
"Bite me, Frank."
"Ask me, you're better off."
I didn't.
Second EKG is unchanged and troponin is negative.
He's pain-free after nitro and metoprolol.
"So, he's okay?"
"Well, it doesn't look like a heart attack, but I think he has unstable angina."
"One of the arteries around your heart may be closing down, so you'll have to stay in the hospital for observation and some more tests."
For how long?
Could be just a day or two.
- You okay with that?
- Like I got a choice?
You hang in there.
I'll stop by later if I can.
"Um, excuse me."
Excuse me.
Hi.
"It might be better if you stayed, because the cardiologist is probably gonna have questions and instructions for you and your husband."
"Oh, I'm not Lee's wife."
I'm his therapist.
Are you a doctor?
I'm his... satisfaction facilitator.
What is that exactly?
I have a select group of clients like Lee who require... something they're not getting at home.
Something... sexual.
"See, I provide the one thing that's missing, which allows them to live happily ever after with their wives."
Really?
You okay?
That's my husband-
- I called him.
"Just duck under the tape,rick."
Stop.
It's a ime scene.
Crime scene?
"Honey,you all right?"
- She's fine.
- I am not fE.
I had to cancel my 1:00 showing.
Think I found where he was buried.
"Checked for footprints,but it rained last night, so everything's pretty washed out."
You got access?
There's side access at street level.
"Chain link fence around the yard, but any one with gloves could have scaled it."
Wait for me!
The real estate agent solve the big mystery?
"No,but she owns the property with a contractor and every real estate agent in town had access."
I meant the mystery of how they expect to sell a house for 600 grand when it only has two and a half bathrooms.
"Well,you know what they say:"
"Location,location... location."
"So,judging from the marks around the edges, looks like the digger used a garden spade."
"The soil's not real packed,so it wou have been easy digging for a male or a female."
You see that?
- Black plastic bags.
- Garbage bags.
Body bag.
"Get it back to abby,and a soil sample."
I want ground-penetrating radar.
"Uh,boss,those techs are bookedeeks in advance."
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency and I will not budge until they show.
Because I managed To flip it over.
It's starting to look A little black.
So that's almost A little bit compelling.
"Yeah, if zeke can Get past this, like,"
Jumble of boulders down There...
"And there's got to Be something,"
Something heavy Underneath the boulder.
"Hey, zeke, you, You seeing anything down there?"
I kind of just think I'm Seeing more bedrock down here.
"And there isn't really a layer That has any gold on it,"
You know what I'm saying?
"Yeah, no, I get it."
I think we've done All we can do on this side.
"I mean, I'm just..."
I'm not Seeing any heavy minerals.
"Zeke finally found some Bedrock,"
"Which, you know, Could be a potential place."
"For gold to hang out,"
But the bedrock Is just completely clean.
Theres no minerals or anything On it and definitely no gold.
"I think on this side Of the island,"
"All we're gonna find Is rock, dude."
Just rock after rock.
Okay.
Roger.
Neither zeke nor I Have the financial means.
To just spend this season Looking for new ground.
"At some point, if we don't Find what we're looking for,"
We're gonna have to know When to throw in the towel.
"With pinpointed areas Coming up dry,"
The partnership is Running out of options.
And will need a new plan.
Bloodless.
"But in Scotland, there was blood aplenty."
Several northern nobles remained faithful to James.
"One of these Jacobites was john Graham of Claverhouse, now the Viscount Dundee."
"Claverhouse went north, formed an army, won a decisive victory at Killiecrankie, and died of his wounds on the battlefield."
"The first Jacobite rebellion died with him, but its body twitched for some time after."
It took several months to crush the Jacobite garrison in Edinburgh Castle.
But the garrison here held out longest of all.
So it was on the Bass Rock that the Stuart dynasty finally lost its grip on power.
"At last, there was a kind of peace."
The moderate remnants of the Presbyterians reached a compromise with King William.
"Bishops were abolished, and the Presbyterians resumed control of the Church of Scotland."
But they were deceiving themselves.
They were the Church of southern Scotland.
"Because in the north, loyalty to the older kind of God-anointed king remained in force."
"The split in the Kirk was a split in the country, an unheated wound, and the Stuarts, of course, were far from dead."
Health care!

Come on.
"Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer."
"You know the drill. I´m gonna ask you some questions, but I´m on your side."
We wanna establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?
"Sit down, Jack."
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2.31am.
"lnterrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU."
Ryan Chappelle is present.
"Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramón Salazar."
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel in Mexico.
(Tony) So when did you meet Amador?
Did you know him when you were working at CTU?
"Tell me something, Nina."
What kind of a deal do you think you´re gonna cut?
"You´ve betrayed everybody you know, including me."
You murdered Jack´s wife.
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
You´re helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
Help me understand this.
What do you want?
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer?
Your neck is bleeding.
"- Dalton, what have you got?"
- So far the only reactions are subliminal.
If she won´t talk we need to be plugged into her vitals.
"We can take her to seven, do a passive-response test."
Seven´s not secure enough.
She stays here.
How dare you?
You... you're...
As soon as you learnt about Tisha... it was clear that Kabir needed to die immediately.
Before he could rewrite his will.
You thought that when the police arrived and found guests like us present... you would show them the video recording.
"Then who in their right minds, would ever suspect you?"
Wait a minute.
Are you implying that I killed Mr. Malhotra?
That morning...
"Good morning, Mr. Malhotra."
Good morning.
"You went to his room, just as you did everyday."
Here's your mail.
When you were sure that he wasn't paying attention to you... you carried out your plan.
Using his pistol... very smoothly... you shot him.
You shot him in cold blood.
This is absurd.
Perhaps you don't remember that when the bullet was fired...
I was with you.
No.
What?
!
You were with me... when we heard what we thought was a gunshot.
Was that a gunshot?
The plan was good.
All you needed were two things.
One... an alibi... who would vouch that you were with him when the gun was fired.
Are you always an early riser or is today an exception?
"And, two... a small fire cracker."
And since there was to be a fireworks display that night... it wasn't diffcult getting a fire cracker.
"You can't smoke in here, Mr. Menon."
It's a pity you won't be able to enjoy tonight's celebration.
We laid her to rest under her real name - Dreidel.
Flora Dreidel.
"If you find Malone, tell him I said he's a bum!"
Uh-oh.
I helped you bring that TV into the building the day we met.
You said it was for a friend.
"Actually, it was for me."
"You found my, uh..."
little hideaway.
"All these books, these videos, are yours?"
A hot plate?
Enough food for a family of gorillas?
- So I bend the regulations when I unwind.
- (clock chimes)
Uh-oh.
Sun's almost down.
"Time to roll, partner."
"So, how'd it go with Mace's stepson?"
"According to Pine Lawn, an old man comes by every Thursday to leave a rose on Flora Dreidel's crypt."
"I know it's a long shot, but... tomorrow is Thursday."
"All these years, and you still have a soft spot for Flora."
"Must have been tough becoming dead to the world, abandoning your wife."
But you had no choice.
The Illuminati decided you were irreplaceable.
Excuse me?
Nobody knew more about underworld dealings than Mace Malone.
"Once the gangs found out an outside faction knew their secrets, you were a marked man."
You had to disappear.
"Thanks to you, the Illuminati had the goods to cut themselves in."
They've been organized crime's silent partner ever since.
"Young man, how long have you been plagued by these fanciful delusions?"
Not as long as you've had this tattoo.
"Sometimes daydream it, what there would be if even more, much more are men could deal with box folding?"
"That time comes possibly once, when can be put on all of the humanity will be."
It would be a big thing.
"Sure, I think that it is not allowed to make this uniform."
All nations could fold boxes with an other form with an other colour.
"The Dutchmen round one like that, than their cheese."
The French in the colours of the tricolour.
"The Germans do the largest, most beautiful boxes then naturally."
"But this does not mean it, that for the Russians, it will be allowed to fold boxes if we defeated them already, sure only small ones, than the match box."
"Clear, that this will not be soon,"
Hard work is needed for him.
But if the idea wins if it succeeds all of the humanity will bless our name.
"You do not pay attention to me, Tót!"
- But yes.
- But your mind is somewhere else entirely!
Maybe is on the red spotted butterfly?
"No, no."
Well then what?
Major lord.
I know an other road.
"Somewhat longer, but more beautiful."
Let us go under the gardens.
Why?
This road is very good.
"What happened to you, Tót?"
Tell?
Honestly.
"-Be sick at something, major lord."
- What?
"It before, when we were spent on this you jumped a ditch."
And I jumped over.
"Of course, the man it jump the ditch."
We'll have to go over the whole system when we get back.
"All right, try and contact Tarrant now."
SOOLIN: (Over radio) Tarrant.
"Tarrant, come in please."
Avon certainly chooses his moments.
"Well, at least they've fixed the teleport."
And we've had a demonstration of the Federation's new weapon.
- Isn't there any defence against it?
- Only to shoot first.
We can move out of here soon.
They won't run another census today.
What did I say?
Didn't I tell you Tarrant would blow it?
We don't know that for certain.
"Right now, he's probably strung up while they thread red hot filaments through his nerve centres, if he's got any."
"It'll be, ""Where'd you come from?"
How'd you get here?
"Are there any more like you?"""
"For pity's sake, Avon, get this ship moving while we still have a chance."
"Slave, I want an infrared surface sweep every 30 seconds."
Immediate notification of any launchings.
"At once, Master."
- That'll be too late.
- I don't think so.
We can't be sure that anything has happened to them.
Maybe it just wasn't convenient for them to answer.
"Right, like their arms are being pulled out at the shoulders."
"Vila, until we are attacked, we are staying."
"Blake would have been proud of you, you know."
I know.
But then he never was very bright.
(Beeping)
And we know he's gonna be watching.
"Well, we're gonna bust him this year."
We've got two agents on the way to last night's crime scene.
Great.
I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
It gets dark early this time of year.
- And we'll head to the morgue.
- Hope you have a strong stomach.
Gasoline was the accelerant?
"Gas vapors collect in a low, enclosed space."
"When he ignited, those vapors burned down to his bone."
We call this a fourth-degree burn.
There's a fracture on the back of his skull?
- That's right.
- Was that postmortem?
"No, it was antemortem bruising."
He was struck from behind.
Blitz attack.
What's this on the face?
Charred fabric.
All of the victims have the same material on them.
"The fire fused the original garment to his flesh, then burned away, leaving behind these remains."
- He's covering their faces?
"- That's my best guess, yes."
He doesn't want his victims looking at him even though we wants to watch them die.
It could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.
"[Rossi] Now, wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?"
"Instead, he keeps them in the dark."
He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
It's an execution.
[Prentiss] It's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
"We find that road, we find him."
"And we don't stop, got it?"
So let's keep looking.
Let's find him.
MONTENEGRO:
"So, I used Booth's theory that whoever took Aldo based their route on avoiding surveillance."
Every turn they took was weighted towards avoiding cameras and crowds.
CAM:
That is elegant.
But what happens when there's more than one equal choice?
"Yeah, well... it gets less and less useful."
This is now out of control.
"Well, at least it gives us a general direction."
"Hey, I swabbed the perimortem striations on the ribs."
The rat bites?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"So, rat teeth never stop growing."
Which means they're always having to gnaw on something just to keep them the right length.
Good to know.
What were they gnawing on?
I don't know.
"I found, uh, particulates of lead paint, so maybe they were gnawing on some cabinets, looking for food."
When was lead paint banned?
(beeping) 1978.
"So-so, we've got professional-grade acoustic foam and lead paint."
We need to be looking for a sound studio built before 1978.
Somewhere northwest of Bellevue.
"Right, but it would have to be near Rock Creek Park, because they had to get that body back there by morning."
(Cam sighs)
That's still a few square miles.
"Well, if it's a studio, it's likely to be abandoned."
But I know the feeling of wanting someone so much that it hurts.
"This fiction, known as love, drives people crazy, as you said."
"Then you're either mad, alone..."
Or dead.
But that was fiction.
Right!
We're dead!
"I do believe two people can come together, even marry, for reasons more concrete than sex."
"A love that grows in time out of respect, love, trust, common interest."
Have you noticed that friendships last longer than marriages?
The 12th century was on to something.
Would you like some coffee?
Tea?
- Got any scotch?
- Yeah.
Are you busy this week?
I was hoping you could help me with my teaching.
I'm sure you're much better than you give yourself credit for.
"Maybe you could sit in on one of my classes, tell me what you think."
"If X squared plus Y squared equals 16, how do we find DY, DX as an implicit function of X and Y?"
"Well, Y is a function of X..."
"You walk across the room like this, and you're into your own thing."
"Your body language is very detached, very alienating."
"I think you have to relate more to the kids, engage them."
"You're up there with your back to the room, solving your own problems."
"It's like you're having a math party, and you only invited yourself."
- No math party.
- No math party.
Relax.
Loosen up.
Have some fun.
Relax.
I understood.
I understood that sir acted in front of me.
That slap.. that slap was an act.
Sir.. sir loves me a Iot.
Sir loves me a Iot.
"Krishna, what.."
Its not a doctors concern.
Hejust said and went that admit brother in a hospital.
But we will have to pay the fees.
We dont have any money plant with us..
..that we can plunk them from it.
"Brother, but we will have to get him treated."
"No, its important to get him admitted in a hospital."
But its not necessary that it should be a private hospital.
"Sister-in-Iaw is right, brother."
We will be brother admitted in a charitable hospital.
"Yes, we arejust concerned with the treatment."
people even get treated overthere.
You all dont worry about brother.
This situation shall never arise as long as I am there.
You wish to tell the world that we dont care about brother?
Itsjust you who takes care of him.
With an ordinaryjob of a steno..
..thinks great of herself.
"Jyoti, I wanted to ask you why did you take up.."
..such a humiIiatingjob and tried to defame ourfamiIy name?
The familys respect is ruined..
"..because of me working, brother?"
And the fact that you wish to get brothertreated..
..in a charitable hospital will do wonders to ourfamiIy name?
"Jyoti, you are crossing your limits."
"I have learnt to cross limits from you all, sister-in-Iaw."
The men you meet are often lots of fun.
"I mean, each ones different."
"One's fat, one's thin."
Some men have big ones.
some have small ones.
"Some men shoot huge loads, others almost nothing."
My potency lies in.
"as I discovered at some point, that I can shoot off a very powerful load of semen."
With it I've left many women pretty amazed.
"Because, and here I'm only guessing... because it must smack the vaginal wall pretty hard when I come."
And ladies must like to feel that.
"And if I do the famous coitus interruptus, and pull out and then shoot."
The ladies are amazed at the load that comes out of me.
Otherwise my potency isn't very different from other people's.
It's just my pressures really strong when it shoots out.
"- Thank you, mistress."
- The kilo weight!
"- One, mistress?"
"- Yes, one."
"Look, the cock weight's slipped again."
"I put such lovely ornaments on my penis, but they keep slipping."
- You can do the dishes now.
"- Thank you, mistress."
Let's check your posture.
It's my cock.
It's my scrotum.
My slave's body belongs to me.
I have total control over it.
I decide...
"I mean, except for personal hygiene, of course."
That's very important.
"At first he had to wear a chastity belt, because I forbid him to jerk off."
Major lord!
Major lord!
The decay of my nervous system is the consequence of partisans' constant harassment.
I may not burden my kind hosts with withal.
Let's go.
"When Tót family they got home with the major, who did not stand on his foot already."
He tolerated that the host and his wife should make it undress helplessly.
"let it be washed with tender hands let his whole body be dried throughout let it nurse, coddle let it be dressed in pyjamas, let it be invested in a bed."
He slept in faint unconsciousness already by the time it was covered up.
Mariska with Ágika did the washing ironed always yet around p.m.6 o'clocks.
The guest put his thing in order.
Tót was not able to keep the curious ones at a distance.
"Very much not good, that lies on his heart."
He presses it.
He has what kind of correct small foot.
It is very normal foot.
"- I did not say it, that not normal."
- Not it.
But watching too small.
- I was watching too small?
- You.
I was surprised at the fact that a human foot may be like this only.
How so?
I said no bad one.
The single very normal one and... healthy foot.
- Do not be trying to be clever.
The foot of all majors is like this.
"Very much not good, that lies on his heart."
He moved.
He sat up.
- Good bye.
Good bye.
Few who lived through the last conflict will set much store by government assurances that any war against Germany will be over swiftly.
Mrs Barden -
"- When war does begin, it will hurl us all into a period of great change."
"Something you, Madam President, have proven steadfastly resistant to over the course of your term in office."
"Mrs Collingborne, would you kindly control your sister?"
"As you know, Madam President, that isn't as straightforward as you imply."
Ooh.
Can you help me up?
Blimey... what happened to you?
Army lorry.
Ow.
- Ooh.
Oh...
- Oh!
Sorry.
Are you all right?
- I'm late.
Where are you going?
I am more than willing to put my proposition to the vote.
"Any objections to that, Mrs Barden?"
"Only that the membership has been so tightly managed over the years, it will almost certainly deliver whatever you ask of it."
Shame on you for not sharing my faith in our colleagues' independence of mind.
Shame... on... you.
"If we walk slower, it might not hurt so much."
"I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson."
I'm late.
"Well, why don't we leave your bike here... and I'll get you to where you need to be double-quick on the back of mine?"
Sure you can carry me?
You're no heavier than a bag of mail.
- Charming!
"A small, light, bag of mail."
- Hmm.
That's absolutely amazing.
You're right.
The parka and the ski mask.
That's where they both came from.
And the gun?
"Come on, sir."
You're putting me on.
You know that guns don't come from the wardrobe department.
Of course.
How stupid of me.
"No, that's the prop department, sir, not the wardrobe department."
How does a smart man like Lieutenant Lucerne make a mistake like that?
"Because you're not talking to Lieutenant Lucerne at the moment, are you, Lieutenant?"
You're talking to Ward Fowler.
"Well, what's the difference, sir?"
The difference is Ward Fowler's under suspicion of murder.
And a man under that kind of threat is apt to make mistakes.
He's apt to get rattled.
"Well, who ever said anything about Ward Fowler being under suspicion of murder?"
Lieutenant Lucerne did.
He did?
"Well, how did he come to that conclusion, sir?"
He had to face the same fact you did.
"What fact is that, sir?"
There are only four people who could have murdered Claire.
You mean the four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night.
Exactly!
"And only one of those is instantly associated with makeup, wardrobe and props."
COLUMBO:
"Well, now, let's see."
Mrs. Daley took the call from her secretary in your dressing room when she said that she was going to...
"Oh, what's his name, sir?"
- We discussed it at the last meeting.
"That's right, you weren't there."
"As our brother, you deserve our forgiveness, and our loving ridicule."
Line it up.
For
Curses...
"You met my friend Calvin, I was wondering, if you'd consider taking him as one of our pledges, he dropped out of the Omega Chis."
"- He's smart, really good at sports."
"- You'd me at ""dropped out of the OCs."""
"Cultivating a new pledge, not to mention stealing one from our arsh enemies,"
- this is what brotherhood is all about.
- I do what I can.
- I'll get it
"- You're not sucking up, I'll get it."
Which Law  Order are you with?
Can I have to issue you your citation?
Open container of an alcoholic beverage.
Again?
There's nothing even here.
Except of maybe the tiniest bit of foam.
That's not gonna hold up on a court of law.
Try to stay out of trouble.
Give my love to dean Bowman.
Here's your ball.
"At least, we're gonna have a party."
"I went to wilder parties in elementary school, I can't believe this, it's like"
"I have no control anymore, my relationship with Evan span out of control,"
- I can't manage with Lizzi.
- OK stop.
"Compromise is what comes with territory,"
- you're just being a good president.
- I'm a terrible president.
Our ancestors existed with the land.
"But despite that, they were driven from their land, and forced to live a life of poverty and disgrace."
"But on the day our mighty soldier awakens, we know we can regain our once lost pride."
And we know that this mighty soldier is the one that will save this world from the coming threat!
"Everything ended, and started, with meeting her."
You were young then.
"Tears, screams and decisions..."
Fate dictates how the wheels of time will spin.
And its only mission is to create a steel giant.
You were a student.
"Don't miss Great Dangaioh Episode 11, ""The Past Returns."""
You were really so young.
"Commander, what is it you want to say?"
Err... nothing.
Get outta here...
GET OUT!
"This is Dangaioh's new weapon, the super pyrogenic Stream Blaster."
This will be able to burn away
Exceptions' outer layer of mirrored armor.
Then what was the point of having me use my sai?
"Of course, this will put a bigger stress on you physically and mentally."
It's best if we never have to use it.
"Yeah, yeah..."
Tell me about it.
Any other questions?
"If there are none, I'll explain the firing mechanism."
"Okay, then let's move on."
A bigger strain...
"First, look at this part of the monitor."
Brother...
Looks like there's a storm coming...
"The sea was rough, that day, too."
- Prime numbers!
"Two, three, five, no nine."
- They're beautiful!
How'd you do that?
- I had them made just for you.
- They were done very fast.
- Thank you.
Well...
"I've wanted to ask you something, and I can only say this once..."
Sit down.
We have a lot in common.
"Some variables will remain unknown, as is the case with most complex equations."
"Greg, talk to me."
I'm not saying this right.
"This feeling you have for Alex, it won't be the same with me."
"You won't have that ache in your stomach, because we're not in love."
I think we share a genuine affection for each other.
We share a passion for knowledge rather than a physical passion.
"Although, if sex is something that interests you,"
"I'm sure I could provide that on occasion, given enough warning."
- What are you saying?
- We were both in love and miserable.
"It's a waste, because as people, we're valuable."
"When I look at you, I see a woman unlike any I've ever known before."
"Your mind, your humor, your passion for ideas."
I'm very fond of you.
"When I'm with you, I feel as if I'm home."
So I think we should get married.
People marry for sex or beauty.
Are my reasons more insane than those?
Are you in shock or just appalled?
Blink if you can hear me.

"Hello, hockey fans!"
Welcome to tonight's game.
It should be a real barn burner!
"Charlestown, 1978."
"We should have lost hope when the steel mill closed down, but that was the year our beloved Chiefs won the Federal Cup, led by the infamous Hanson Brothers."
"Their aggressive style of hockey brought passion to the team, hope to the town."
"Metropolis had its Superman, Gotham City had its Batman, and Charlestown had the Hansons."
"And like everyone, though, eventually, they disappeared."
"Bounced, bolted, vanished, deep-sixed."
"But this, my friend, is the story of how they were found again, resurrected and transformed, together with a group of ragtag orphans."
It was their task to defend Charlestown against a heinous villain like none other.
"A real estate developer, a devil in a black pantsuit who hornswoggled me out of my own town."
"Her name, Bernie Frazier."
"Well, 30 years later and your vision has finally come true, Mayor Kenneth."
This wasn't my vision.
"Another done deal, done right."
- Go ahead.
- You got it.
"Out with the old, in with the new."
"We got to do something quick, or Bernie's going to roll right across that river and wipe us off the map."
- You want to save your home?
- Of course.
People love an underdog.
Maybe we can give them something to believe in again.
- Are you gonna do it?
- I'm not gonna tell him.
"Come on, dude, I told him last time."
- Here he comes.
- We're next anyway.
"- All right, guys, listen up."
- Bring it in.
Here's my plan.
We work in their businesses.
We get good grades.
"We stay out of trouble, mostly."
"But that's not enough, no."
"We have to make this town love us again, men."
Remind them what we're made out of.
We have to become champions if we want to win that vote.
- So we're joining the junior league.
- Join?
What does he...
"We'll take down the Hounds, win over this town and save our home."
"Little enthusiasm here, guys?"
"Well, I mean..."
Where are the little dudes?
That CFS lady came and got them.
She says they've been fostered.
Sorry.
"As a mother, Dickie, I simply could not abide the thought of these tiny youngsters living in such awful conditions."
"So while the good people of Charlestown decide the fate of the decrepit Newman Home, they will reside with me until a more permanent situation arises."
"After a while, it got to be all normal."
None of it seemed like crimes.
It was more like Henry was enterprising and that he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling while other guys sat on their asses waiting for handouts.
"Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue-collar guys...."
"The only way they could make extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners."
"Where's the strong box, you fuckin' varmint?"
Don't fucking move!
Don't move!
-See you at the diner.
-l'm riding shotgun.
Did you see him give it right over?
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.
We were all so very close.
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.
And being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal.
"Hello Mrs. Hill, police."
I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.
We have a search warrant.
Would you read and sign it?
Anywhere?
We have to go through everything.
You boys want some coffee?
"No coffee now, thanks anyways."
-Just be careful.
-We'll just go about our business.
There was always a little harassment.
They always wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.
"They'd come in with their subpoenas and warrants, and make me sign."
But mostly they were just looking for a handout.
A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.
"Something about ""My lieutenants and I are going to tunnel into my vault."""
"Tunnel, that's how most crooks get into vaults."
But into her own vault?
And she couldn't have gotten far.
She's left the Black Widow Cycle here.
This must be it.
And two for me.
Two for you.
And two for me.
Two for you.
"I wouldn't grow too attached to all of that if I were you, Black Widow."
"For heaven's sake, look who's here."
"You didn't count on us, did you, you sophisticated but evil woman?"
"As a matter of fact, no."
But how fiendishly clever of you.
"And how handsome you are, Bat-doll."
"Watch out for a trick, Batman."
"Don't worry, Robin."
She won't catch us off guard this time.
"You needn't try to short circuit our brains, Black Widow."
We're still wearing our anti-short circuit Bat-brain electrodes.
"Batman, I've lost one of my electrodes."
"Bad luck, old chum, but perhaps I can pull off a bluff."
No amount of UHF short circuiting can affect the brain of either Robin or me.
"Are you definitely wearing your electrodes, darlings?"
- Definitely.
-Definitely.
"Marvelous, because I've reversed the polarity on my brainwave short circuiter."
Just an added little precaution.
"And with the electrodes on, you've had it."
"You, she-devil."
Have you short circuited Batman's brain?
I
Building the Cambodian army up?
"My God, thatwould be harder than a Vietnamese Army."
They have no tradition.
"Mr. President, the government there will collapse."
"- So you're saying, do nothing."
"- No, sir, continue the bombing."
The same old horseshit.
"Well, that's not good enough."
"I'm sick of being pushed around by the, uh, Vietnamese... like we're some, uh, you know, pitiful giant."
They're using our P.O.W. S to humiliate us.
"Whatwe need now is a bold move into Cambodia, and go rightaftertheir, uh,V.C. Base camps, and, uh, uh, make 'em scream, hit'em in the ass."
"- What do you think, Henry?"
"- Well, as you know, mostof my staff have weighed in againstthis incursion."
They believe itwill fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily... and will result in crushing criticism domestically.
I didn'task whatyour staffthinks.
"What do you think, Henry?"
"What I think is, they're cowards."
Theiropposition represents the cowardice ofthe eastern establishment.
"They don't realize, as you do, sir, thatthe Communists only respectstrength, and theywill only negotiate in good faith..."
"- ifthey fearthe madman, Nixon."
- Exactly!
Unpredictability is our best asset.
"We gotta take the warto 'em, hit'em where it hurts, right in the nuts."
More assassinations.
"Right, AI?"
"That's whatthey're doing, Mr. President."
"See, your people in the State Department, Bill, they don't understand."
- You gotta-
- Mr. President.
You gotta electrify people with bold moves.
"I mean, bold moves make history."
"I know what we said, but we have changed our mind and we..."
we reconsidered your offer.
"And we think that actually it would go down quite well, because, er... see...that day that you talked about..."
( indistinct muttering )
"Um...deeper, baby , deeper ..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
oh...
"like I never do it, princess."
Have you gals heard about this guy?
"O.k , so basically there was this guy that stole some shit from Chet."
What did this guy take from him?
A truck full of cologne.
"Now, this truck contains something in addition to just cologne"
Something like what?
A bag full of money.
The weird part is that the guy called us up and then have the stones to taunt us after he did what he did.
Stones...
Or some kind of death wish .
Coz he obviously gave us his address .
"His name and number were clear as day, the whole time he was fucking with us ."
Cold Pepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She has checked him out.
Says he's leaving in the morning comes back in the afternoon.
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord is on our team, so the door will be open."
Better be!
Relax!
The door will be open .
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
Why not?
"They're all knockoffs-- The purse,the dress,the shoes."
She wants people to think she's a model.
She doesn't want to admit how she met stein.
"Personally, i don't blame her."
"I mean,you never heard me mention those parties."
"Well,we'll be okay,then."
Women who go to those parties
Are not necessarily prostitutes or strategic daters.
But the jury will think she is.
"Well,you're not,right?"
"The main thing is, you believe her."
"Unlike you, i don't have to believe"
"The clients to defend them, but,yes,i believe her."
"Her clothes are phony, but those bruises are real."
Come on.
We gotta meet ron.
You never mentioned that we represented ann?
Suzanne never asked.
And she's gonna go ballistic
When she realizes you did pre-Spin.
It makes good tv.
Good tv helps her ratings and our client every time.
We are set to turn ann over to the beverly hills police department.
A.D.A. Keller went on duty ten minutes ago.
It is time.
You couldn't get her to target to get a new outfit?
"There are no 24-Hour targets around here,ron."
"You know,the whole point of getting the knife"
And arranging for her surrender
Was to show that she had nothing to hide.
Changing her clothes would be tampering with evidence.
"We don't cross that line,ever."
Everyone does.
"Uh,rick."
"Strange,isn't it,rick,someone committed a murder standard."
But then they covered it up standard.
And then they uncovered it.
Far from standard.
You think my we was involved.
No.
And that's the problem.
James was a big man there is no way that I could've picked him up and buried him.
"Oh,that's easy."
You roll him onto the plastic and you drag him out.
Without ruining these nails?
Look at them they are so perfect.
I tried to convince agent gibbs that your wife was telling the truth.
I'm afraid he doesn't lieve me.
"Tell me,rick,why does that please you?"
What?
"Well,you just flashed a slight,reflexive smile when I said that gibbs didn't believe your wife."
I did not.
Timothy?
I'm afraid he doesnt believe me.
"I don't know if god was watching your wife and finn thanight, but you re."
My-my wife and the dead guy?
"Yes,when your wife ran out of the house, you buried the body."
"My god,man,why would I do that?"
Because you wanted the money.
"Well,you had to wt until her father died before you could implicate her in the murder."
"But once she got her inheritance, you disinterred the body."
"You-u have a vivid imagination,ducky."
"But,uh,imagination don't prove anything."
"No,you're quite right there."
They won't get anything from me.
They are masters at exploiting weakness.
We all have weaknesses.
We all do.
And they will find yours.
What do you need me to do?
"We're gonna go through your file... and go over all the parts of your life... that make you the most vulnerable to them... financially, emotionally, sexually."
"No, no, no."
I-I'm not at all comfortable with this.
"Well, it's not my first choice either, but..."
I'm going to need you to tell me things... secrets that you might not have told anyone else.
Because that is where their power lies... in secrets.
If they can keep you afraid and ashamed... then they can keep you silent.
And if they can keep you silent... they can control you.
- Have you ever been engaged to be married?
- No.
- And how many close friends would you say you have?
- A few.
Not many.
Could you be more specific?
"Uh, two, I think."
"Um, you never really know enough about people though."
"So, are you gonna say that because I'm a loner, I'm more vulnerable?"
"Look, I'm not sure how they will approach you... but I am sure that they will."
All right.
"But let me assure you, Agent Beeman..."
I would never betray my country.
No one ever imagines they will.
[Larrick] Riggs and Dubrow...
What happened?
Official story?
Truck flipped in training.
His Majesty will be most pleased.
"We have killed Yi Do-hyung, but we failed to capture Yum Moon."
"He is the real leader of the pirates, a great warrior and strategist who once served as the commander of Yi Sa-do's troops."
We can't say we have suppressed the pirates until we capture him.
Head Chief Jang is more than capable of capturing him.
Put your worries to rest.
Jump.
You will risk your life for a girl when we have lost everything and been chased out to sea?
You have been losing your calm since Jang Bogo came to Shilla.
"At that rate, you will be defeated again."
Control your emotions first.
Take them away.
Please forgive us just this once.
Please.
Wait.
You don't seem to be soldiers.
Why are you taking those people by force in broad daylight?
I have never seen you in Mujinju before.
Where are you thugs from?
Such insolence!
How dare you?
No good will come to you from causing a scene.
Stay out of it.
- Take them away!
"- Yes, sir."
- Find out who they are.
"- Yes, sir."
They were Madam Jami's private troops.
She has more than a hundred men under her command.
"She is a Jingol noble, and holds great power in Mujinju."
"The Mujinju governor is her puppet, and her troops wield more power than government troops."
Would you continue to look around town?
The Xindi are trying to destroy Earth... because they heard that humans are ruthless.
ARCHER:
This is a chance to prove them wrong.
We can bring the eggs aboard.
Reconfigure one of the cargo bays.
I already talked to Phlox.
He says they're integrated into the hatchery walls.
"If we remove them, they'll die."
"Sir, this is crazy."
These people are trying to kill us.
This isn't open for discussion.
ARCHER:
I'll lead the engineering team.
I need you here to help Travis figure out how to operate that Xindi shuttle.
-Captain.
-I've made my decision.
ARCHER:
Get to work.
"ARCHER: [On tape] Captain's Starlog, January 8, 2154."
We've been in orbit for more than a day.
"The crew is restless, eager to resume our mission."
But I'm certain my decision to stay was the right one.
"They may know how to build a weapon system, but these people could learn... a thing or two about designing a comfortable chair."
"For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable."
The power grid doesn't make much sense.
Almost half of it is routed to structural integrity.
You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant.
Assuming you could figure out how to fly it.
This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds.
Give it a shot.
I don't think this ship likes us very much.
REED:
- The one by the--
"- No, I meant what kind?"
How long were you in the bathroom?
I didn't actually go. I mean. I had a stomach ache but I didn't actually go.
Because?
Because you heard something in the hallway.
"I heard like a scuffle, but I didn't see anyone when I came out..."
I just heard the shot.
You heard a scuffle loud enough to keep you from taking nature's call...
but you didn't see anything.
No sir.
"Brian, I don't have to tell you this is a serious criminal act..."
- we are talking about here.
- Yes sir.
I'd hate to hear that you were protecting someone.
With your unblemished record and all.
I'm not protecting anyone.
Ladies and gentlemen.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please."
May I have your undivided attention for one moment?
Please may I have your attention?
Your undivided attention.
Thank you. I just wanted to let you know some of the things...
we have been working on to ensure a safe environment here at Liberty.
We will not tolerate violence in our schools.
"We will not accept it, and we will not live with it."
But all the safety measures in the world...
won't work unless I have the cooperation of you.
All of you.
Yeah.
The people who come to these meetings are the people...
who let their kids have guns.
"Honey, no matter how many times you have your croissant buttered over..."
"- there, it's still work."
- All right.
Time to move out.
"If you need to reach me, you can call my beeper."
It's 197-UP-SKIRT.
The most important thing to do right now...
This is absolute disgrace!
I can't believe we're all the way downtown... volunteer for this damn charity carnival.
It's pathetic!
You don't see anyone at Vogue having to do this.
I'm the Hair Editor.
I don't crawl around... on the ground picking up dart in the name of expertise.
It's a fairly unusual charity.
Although balls are important.
"- Antoniette, how's you husband?"
- You're married?
- Absolutely!
- And does he still live in Spain?
"Yes, the Atlantic is a fabulous thing for our relatonship."
How often do you see each other?
At holidays!
You were a great director in that video.
Maybe you don't screw this.
"Actually I was going to be a photographer, but the only people who would hire me is sleazy balls in those tabloid photo agencies."
What did you have to do?
Stalk people?
Exactly what I did.
Casually I needed to follow Carol O'Connor... with the sun acid by the roof in the quarter.
- That's sick!
"- Yeah, beyond."
I had this severe moral thing when I was crop star... with my first thirty pound laker.
And do not cease until you have spilled seed.
"My very first memories were formed within this arena, attending the games as a child, upon my father's knee,"
too young to yet form words.
"Yet even then, I knew that I would give my life to this place."
A noble calling.
One I had dreamed you would share in.
Was I not raised here as well?
Upon your knee?
You were.
I fear it is the one thing we hold common now.
"And you stand me at fault, as you always have."
I stand you accountable for your actions.
You have caused much heartache.
Never heeding my words.
"Fighting me at every turn, your ambition, the bolt hurled against my wishes."
And here is where it has led.
Two men at constant odds.
Mired in the ruins of what might have been.
Ruins I aided in creation.
"I wanted you to join me here, to see them buried."
"You are my son, Quintus."
"And I will always love you, no matter the path you take."
"What moves such downpour, after eternal drought?"
Tullius makes offer.
Position in the opening games.
- At what price?
- Gannicus.
And your response?
"Without meaning, if you are not by my side upon the day's arrival."
"You give me until tomorrow, and yet now press for answer?"
"A day, a year..."
A man either knows his heart or he does not.
She shaun't be alone
It is Hatice's first baby.
She's very worried
You'll calm her down with your experience
You were absent all day long
I miss you.
Where have you been?
I had things to do
Will I always be yearning for you ?
Won't this pain have an end?
You'll always be in love and yearning for me
"This is the love, Hürrem"
I miss the sky and clouds of Castilla
Signore Gritti should have sent a message
Your fiance Prince Friedrich will absolutely find a way
I don't know if we can really rely on Gritti
She lives in this Ottoman hell willingly
He's among the barbarians
A wagon arrived
Can it be Sultan Süleyman?
What's she saying?
She's asking why we came here
We are here with the order of İbrahim Paşa
By now Melek Hatun will be at the service of Princess Isabella.
She'll teach her Turkish
She doesn't want to learn our language
She won't stay here for a long time
She doesn't need it
It would be for her sake to learn Turkish
She'll be more comfortable as long as she lives here
She says that if they really think about my comfort they can bring a table to eat dinner
They make a princess eat on the floor like a barbarian
"Oh, what primitive fury."
"Why, he's the very soul of sublime savagery."
"Trelane, let him go."
We haven't even got our phasers.
"Yes, of course."
I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too much.
"But I warn you, you can't provoke me again."
"Come, everyone."
Let's forget your bad manners.
Let's be full of merry talk and sallies ofwit.
We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind.
"Come, Doctor, do partake."
"Ah, you've been, uh... quite derelict in your social duties, Captain."
You haven't introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew.
This is...
General Trelane.
Retired.
"But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely squire of Gothos, dear ladies."
Lieutenant Uhura of Communications.
Ah... a Nubian prize.
"Taken on one of your raids of conquest, no doubt, Captain."
No doubt.
"She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba, the same lovely coloring."
And this.
Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
"Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss."
Yeoman Teresa Ross.
I believe you have met our science officer Mr. Spock.
"You do realize, don't you, that it's in deference to the captain that I brought you here?"
Affirmative.
"Well, I don't know if I like your tone."
It's most challenging.
Because of trust.
Trust that the politicians the people voted for will uphold their integrity.
Trust that the newly entering soliders believe their nation will protect them.
Trust that college will build the kinds of talents needed for the new era.
"That the corporations, will be there, together with their laborers, through their pain and their growth."
That trust.
"And also, those men who waited in Nampo Waters, trusting in the promise of their nation."
The trust of 21 men.
Guarding that trust.
Is what I believe to be a great cause.
The Sweep Mission 28 years ago... there's not a day that goes by that I have forgotten about it.
"How much Jin Pyo suffered,"
I know that very well.
Take this.
"These are illegal campaign funds I received, while I was in politics."
Do whatever you want.
"Whatever you do, I'll be grateful."
Yoon Sung.
"You living like this, your father is sorry."
Are you really... going to do this to the end?
"The person who's suffered and had the most difficult time is you, Lee Yoon Sung."
Do you have to do it like this?
There's no one else other than me...
I have to do it.
People's Daily.
We shall now begin the voting on the 2011 Private School Reform Bill.
The President planned the sweep mission?
What?
...
"What, killing 21 men by the bullets of our own?"
Isn't this crazy!
?
"Everyone brings a camera with them, a cell phone camera or whatever..."
You could borrow one and we go off in small groups  and we take pictures of the products we see in supermarkets.
In supermarkets or drugstores...
We simply go in with our cameras...
It's irritating enough for most of the sales people.
"We go in with the cameras, and take pictures of like hairspray, toothpaste, candy bars  instant soup, packets of noodles, etc... etc..."
We'll form our own impressions  because we've been bombarded from every direction  by foreign pictures.
"- If you'd like to bring others with you, I've prepared some extra flyers."
- Take them with you.
Invite your friends or convince your spouses...
The door is locked.
Chess.
Put your knight over here...
"and then you can take the rook  but before that, you let me out!"
Keep that in mind.
Couldn't be!
I see you two are getting along.
"Tom, how does this dress suit me?"
Fabulous!
And how does he suit me?
A work in progress.
I think so too.
He's demanding.
Are you two finished?
Come on!
I have a surprise for you.
She's also quite demanding.
I'll give it a try.
We start with the action.
We have to do something.
We'll do something...
We have to come together and actually do something.
I can't help you.
You can't attack Jang Bogo in your state.
"I will help you settle in China, if you will sever your ties with me and go to China."
"Are you telling me to disappear, now that you have no use for me?"
You must take a hard look at the reality.
You are cornered now.
Death is what awaits you if you are stubborn.
I have already staked my life.
"If you refuse my request for help, you will also lose everything."
You wish to bring me down with you?
Do you think I will succumb so easily to your threats?
"You, who have so much to protect, would be afraid to die, but I have nothing more to lose."
"Since you are wise,"
I'm certain you will make the right decision.
What happened?
Is she willing to help us?
She wouldn't be able to refuse my request.
"With Master Yi's death,"
Yum Moon's fury has reached its limit.
Harm may come to you if you say no to him.
- Captain.
- Yes.
Find a way to help Yum Moon as he requested.
"Yes, madam."
Stop!
We will exclude those who still haven't mastered the basic skills.
- Sort them out.
"- Yes, sir."
It's not easy for the fishermen to master martial arts skills.
Has anyone gone far out to sea to fish?
How far have you gone?
I almost reached Japan once.
Go!
We don't have time for this.
Drop the gun.
The book.
"The police and Special Branch have traced the perpetrator in Jutland, but you need to focus on the meeting with the party committee."
"Listen, Kamper..."
Kamper?
"Kamper, I just want to say..."
I've just heard about the meeting.
I will of course back you up.
The Treasurer will undoubtedly try to put you in a bad light.
She's tried to sway some of the others ahead of the meeting.
"It doesn't matter what she's done, there won't be any meeting."
"We're looking into important information that will clear the government of all suspicion, and you arrange this?"
"As a Minister and a party member, you're responsible to me alone."
"So, go and tell your people that you're sorry to have wasted their time."
- What information?
- I'm not getting into that.
"But according to a witness, it was Ussing who put pressure on the prosecutor then."
- What witness?
- One of Ussing's former staff members.
Special Branch are looking into his affairs.
I can't give you any more details.
- Of course.
Hopefully it isn't Seifert.
- Do you take us for complete idiots?
Everyone knows he was reported for stealing from Ussing's campaign budget.
Well...
That doesn't matter.
If it's true...
"Regardless, it should be investigated."
I've asked Special Branch...
"Natasha... trust me, you don't want to do this."
- Shut up.
"- Natasha, now go."
Natasha...
I'm warning you.
"Natasha, I said leave now."
- Feeling better?
"- Much better, thanks."
Tell me something... why did you suspect that it wasn't a gunshot?
I'm allergic to gunpowder.
"Especially, the type used in small explosives and fireworks."
It just... shoots up my nose.
Like mustard.
That's it then.
What a story.
Afather who did it all for his daughter... and a daughter who did it all for her father.
"Quite a... faithful bunch, these Malhotras."
Do you ever get serious?
Once.
Rip by Hackos
His flight is going to be land in Athens
I have decided to make a film that will be the biggest film in history
Only you deserve to be a lead actor of this film lf you can come to Samos this friday than we can finalize this deal
I dont know what he said
Today people are asking for our party's funds
Their doubt can be dangerous for us
But I have an idea to make their doubt wrong
Which idea?
The place you have reached in politics I really respect that
I believe Malhotra lnc. and your people party can increase Thailand's economy lf this friday can you come at Samos than we can discuss further
We need this type of clean money this time
Stop.
It's a crime scene.
- Crime scene?
"Honey, you all right?"
- She's fine.
I am not fine.
I had to cancel my 1:00 showing.
MCGEE:
Think I found where he was buried.
"Checked for footprints, but it rained last night, so everything's pretty washed out."
You got access?
There's side access at street level.
"Chain link fence around the yard, but any one with gloves could have scaled it."
Wait for me!
The real estate agent solve the big mystery?
"No, but she owns the property with a contractor and every real estate agent in town had access."
I meant the mystery of how they expect to sell a house for 600 grand when it only has two and a half bathrooms.
"Well, you know what they say:"
"location, location... location."
"So, judging from the marks around the edges, looks like the digger used a garden spade."
"The soil's not real packed, so it would have been easy digging for a male or a female."
You see that?
Black plastic bags.
Garbage bags.
Body bag.
"Get it back to Abby, and a soil sample."
I want ground-penetrating radar.
"Uh, boss, those techs are booked weeks in advance."
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency and I will not budge until they show.
- Who's staying with McGee?
- I can.
If you want Tony to check out the other real estate women.
That's it?
That's all she said?
Seriously?
You know what?
"Actually, Allie did tell me one other thing about you."
What?
Remember that night when you were freaking out about your history exam?
"She told me that she wished that you were there because when she was a kid and was nervous about something, you'd always climb into bed with her until she fell asleep."
"Yeah, that was before she became the second coming of the Boston Strangler."
- Allie.
- So you obviously don't know that I am batshit crazy.
"- Well, he does now."
- You're not batshit crazy.
You were batshit crazy.
"Allie, why didn't you tell him?"
"Compliments, everybody."
Compliments.
You turn to the person across the table from you and give them a compliment.
"Hugh, you start."
"Oh, okay."
"Luke, that's a heck of a shirt you got on there."
Thank you.
Uh...
"Um, I'm still a little stuck on this whole trying-to-kill-you thing."
"Yeah, me too."
I have schizophrenia.
"So, um, is that like the one with different personalities and...?"
"No, that's multiple personality disorder."
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder.
"It doesn't normally make people violent, but it can impair their thinking, emotions, behavior."
I don't really know what that means either.
"Basically, I have hallucinations and sometimes I hear voices that tell me to do things."
"Oh, this is the pump!"
LEVINE:
Yup!
We're in the process of building all across the city.
This street right here used to be fully underwater.
During high tide you may need a canoe.
"And now what we did was we raised this road and you can see the difference, see how that area there kind of goes, slopes down a little bit."
DICAPRIO:
"So the main investment is in these systems right here, raising the roads and the electric pumps."
LEVINE:
"Yeah, this is a 400‐million‐dollar project."
City wide.
And of course we're paying for it by our city revenues.
"I had to raise tax revenue, which you can imagine is not a very popular thing to do as a politician."
DICAPRIO:
And this construction is it going to make a major difference.
LEVINE:
Major difference.
DICAPRIO:
And buy you a significant amount of time.
LEVINE:
"Absolutely I would think about 40, 50 years."
DICAPRIO:
That's it?
LEVINE:
Yes.

"Now one of the things I always say when people ask me this,"
"Mayor what about after 50 years, what's going to happen?"

NTCC decides who gets the organs.
Maybe they can work this out.
"Okay, bring Swan and McGovern in."
"Once everything's under control, I'm gonna tell the NTCC we've got a kidney."
- We can't accept that kidney.
- Why not?
Our guidelines strictly forbid transplanting any organ that's been paid for.
- These are extenuating circumstances.
- Doesn't matter.
Using that kidney would irreparably tarnish our reputation.
Screw your reputation.
That kidney will save a child's life.
We have a hard enough time finding organs.
"Word gets out we're accepting them from people who've been paid, the whole system would fall apart."
- Everyone would want money.
- So that's it.
You're just gonna turn your back on a healthy kidney.
"I'm sorry, detective."
But I have no choice.
"John, the NTCC won't take it."
Doesn't matter.
Swan says Kyle is too unstable right now to take the transplant.
I'll see you back at the squad.
Thanks for coming in.
Where are they?
What are you talking about?
"Well, I just spent the last 15 minutes looking for Munch, McGovern, and the doctor."
They're not here?
"I checked interrogation, interview upstairs."
"There is a bomb inside my bag,"
"Bomb is inside your bag,"
Is it Bomb?
"It is the cover of bomb,"
Then where is bombs?
"Bombs inside your bag D'Melo Yadav,"
Who are you?
Laxminarayan!
"Orange never be hard and,"
"Batla's enemy never have time,"
"A bomb you made will take your life, Give me the remote,"
"Papa, don't listen to him, we changed our bag's tag,"
"And I replaced it, Papa, I... with my personal hands... replace the left side bag's tag to right side bag."
And I replace left one with right one
"I don't understand,"
Can I come in guys?
Can I?
Ok!
Can I say something?
"You people put guns down,"
"Please, Thank you, Now listen to me very carefully,"
"Get me the table please, The left one,"
"The left right, The right one,"
Now tell me who replace the tag first?
"Me, Me, How?"
"Show me,"
"I replace the left one's bag to right one's, when you replace left to right one, That time your left was yours or mine,"
"That was my left,"
"Then I replace left one's to centre, and... replace right one's to left, That's it, simple."
"One, Two, Three, BBC, Bomb Brand Cash."
"Then They turned 1,2 to 2,1,"
"Then again he turns 1,2 to 2,1 and then replace 1 to 3, One Two Three."
Go to the sea and then come to me in a couple of weeks.
Will you be able to come on the 29th in 5 p.m.?
- Yes.
- Brilliant!
Good luck to you.
Good bye.
Good bye.
What do we have here?
We checked your information.
You've never been detained by the police authorities.
You were never put behind the bars.
You were never accused of anything.
There is no criminal case against you.
You were never summoned to the police even as a witness.
But I was arrested by the police!
There was a major and a captain there who beat me and tortured me.
Then they called in a false witness and I was forced to confess to raping her!
Did you see their IDs?
Their surnames?
Their posts?
Do you know the address where it all had happened?
I saw no IDs.
I didn't see that place because they took me to it and out of it unconscious.
They beat me first and drugged me with something later.
It's very strange.
You don't know their surnames.
You don't know the address.
You don't remember where it happened.
You didn't make a photo of your bruises.
You didn't get a blood test to identify the drugs you were given.
You turned to us a week after it all happened.
Please state the facts on which I should open a criminal case.

Please!
I would like to discuss something with you.
"For God's sake, don't say you want to go to the theater?"
I just have to talk to someone who has understanding.
Understanding?
Of what?
Hello!

"Well, he hates me."
So I can think of a number of places
I'd rather be.
(Dozer) Nothing good on the surveillance footage from the reception.
Unless you consider guests sipping Chardonnay and eating mini-quiches helpful.
That's Walker.
Staying next to the woman in the hat.
"He pretty much spent his time glad-handing and listening to people ""ooh"" and ""aah"" about his art."
That's all we got.
The tape finishes when the party ends.
Maybe it was sabotage.
"I mean, Walker's a pretty controversial guy."
"Yeah, maybe the theft was a political statement."
Someone did vandalize some of his pieces at an exhibit three years ago.
Never caught the guy.
"Well, the only thing is that this was his least controversial series in years."
Maybe we should be looking elsewhere.
(Walker) I don't believe this!
You're telling me someone just waltzed in here and stole my work?
"That's two years of my life, Marla!"
"Gus, honey, that's exactly what we're trying to find out."
"Mr. Walker, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
"What about surveillance, huh?"
"I mean, there's security cameras here everywhere."
Someone disconnected them.
"Actually, uh, they were turned off."
"Well, either way."
"No, not exactly."
"No, they weren't broken or disconnected."
They were shut down by someone with a password.
That's enough from you.
Come here with me instead.
With you?
All right.
They can no longer speak!
We have to help them.
You're the only one who can help them.
I will save you.
I will give you back peace.
You needn't be afraid of us.
The ludicrous costume helps keep the villagers away from the ruins.
"As for me, I'm the keeper of this tomb."
Try to tell me how I can assist you.
Revenge.
You are free to take your revenge
The one supposed to be in this tomb is trapped somewhere in these ruins.
"He can only be liberated by innocent hands, by victims of evil."
Tonight he will call you.
He knows you are here.
It's up to you whether or not you want to set him free.
Only he can give you the means to take revenge and find peace again.
"But he's a black angel, a demon wearing a habit."
"If you set him free, you will also release his dark forces which have been locked away for a century now."
The entity imprisoned in these ruins can be very dangerous.
Right now he's possessed.
Evil lives within him.
The one behind the door is two-faced!
"You can find peace there, or death"
It's up to you now.
You can expect him to call you tonight.
Stop fidgeting.
I know they will return.
"At the moment, we're 2 and 8."
"We lost four starters to high school, but we're on the upswing."
Great.
"So since I was in the neighborhood, I was..."
"Well, I thought maybe we could continue our conversation."
"Well, let's just say that I'm ready for you to continue your part of the conversation, and I'll decide whether or not I'm ready to respond."
Are you a lawyer?
"Okay, so you tried to save this building."
You got a TRO.
May I?
"Uh, and you tried to make it stick, and what did you think your chances were of getting a permanent injunction?"
Pretty good.
That's a lawyerly phrase.
I like its specificity.
What do you want?
How good was your case?
It was very good.
We discovered there had been a verbal agreement by the occupants to purchase the building.
"Sounds good, yet the judge threw it out on its merits."
How did you feel about that?
- Was I sad?
"- Okay, were..."
- Were you surprised?
- There's something that I missed?
I can't imagine someone of your ability could've missed anything.
"Well, then, what's the point of asking whether or..."
"Oh, my God."
- They bought the judge.
- Bite your tongue.
This is a public official we're talking about.
"- God, that's what this is about."
- lmagine a powerful corporation supporting justice to serve their own ends. lt's shocking.
"You said it's more like a hobby to you, to kill your time."
"Right, but if you're forced to do this, it wouldn't go that easy."
"But if one is having fun with this and puts all his heart and soul into it, he works like he's getting the highest paycheck."
"Besides, it's kind of statistics that needs constant updates."
I was checking the yesterday's papers.
How about a coffee?
"- Thanks, I don't drink it early."
What kind of newspapers?
"I wouldn't want to be mysterious to you, but otherwise, if I tell you, you may think I'm a bit..."
You know.
Why not?
People do everything out of hobby.
"In fact, I'm doing crime statistics."
I'll give you a wet cloth.
What type of crime?
The financial one?
Something about your profession?
"- No, but crime in general."
There must be some criteria or logic.
There is logic.
"It's a crime statistics in the city of Zagreb, and I'm interested in Trnje neighborhood in particular."
"After all, that's where I come from."
"So, that's why you wanted to live in my house."
Yes...
"Among other things, too."
It's a crime statistics classified by various criteria.
Have a seat!
- Thank you very much.
Why do you need that?
It's a hobby.
I told you.
How come you got involved into crime?
A woman better be pretty damn qualified to have nobody to answer to... and Laine Hanson is not that.
Look me in the eyes and tell me... that Laine Hanson is your first choice for the vice presidency.
Laine Hanson is my absolute first choice.
I'd so want you in my poker game.
Country needs a smooth confirmation.
The president needs a smooth confirmation.
The country needs a competent vice president.
Excuse me a minute.
There's only one person in the world that has that phone number.
So who's the second choice?
We haven't really settled on anybody yet.
"Tell me, if Laine Hanson were to be hit by a flying car... who would the president then select?"
"I think the president still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman."
You know...
"Jack Hathaway, there's a good man..."
for a Democrat.
There's a man I would say would have... a smooth confirmation.
- Jack Hathaway?
- Smooth as a baby's ass.
"- He's already taken himself out of it, so..."
- Right.
Right!
"Well, who the hell knows?"
Perhaps Lainey will shock the world... by pulling out her brilliance... and erudition at the hearings that none of us know she has.
"So, Shelly, can we ask for basic fairness?"
"- Fifty-fifty, Democrat and Republican at the hearings?"
- Of course you can.
Congressman!
Congressman!
Mr. Runyon.
Just wanted to steal you for a second.
I'm Reg Webster.
"I have no further questions, Your Honor."
"[murmuring] Tell me now, Merle."
I got to know Danny through Gina.
That's how we used to meet.
He couldn't have forgotten.
Who is Gina?
Gina Gilbert.
"She's sitting in the back row, next to Corbett."
I asked her to come and be moral support.
"[Judge] Mr. Mason, We await your pleasure."
"My apologies, Your Honor."
"What is your occupation, Mr. Pierce?"
I'm unemployed at the present.
And when you are working?
A salesman.
"Mr. Pierce, have you ever been convicted of a felony?"
- No.
- No?
"Isn't it true you that two years ago, in Fort Worth, Texas, you were arrested for robbery?"
But I was cleared.
"Your Honor, I object to that."
The police are quite properly investigating everyone who conceivably could have taken that necklace.
"But a mere arrest is not evidence of bad character which can impeach a witness, and counselor very well knows that."
"If it please the court, I'm not trying to impeach this witness."
I'm just attempting to cross-examine him on his claim that the objections of the deceased to his marrying my client were unreasonable.
"I think you've made your point, Mr. Mason."
Objection overruled.
"Now, Mr. Pierce, are you married?"
No.
Certainly not.
"Are you acquainted with a woman by the name of Jayne Simmons of Fort Worth, Texas?"
Yeah.
-Not-not in slate.
"I definitely agree with that, yeah."
"So, it could have been a lot deeper."
"Maybe there was a wood hatch, and then it rotted away, and that's what made it slump all of a sudden."
"Jack, we can ""what if"" till the cows come home."
Exactly.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
-That's exactly what I was gonna ask.
-No.
No.
that'sstrange.
"Yes, it is strange."
"Onthewesternside of the island,"
"Rick,Marty and members of the team have invited area archaeologist Laird Niven tohelpin theirinvestigation of a strange, square-shapedhatch."
"Ifthehatchcan be identified as man-made, andofancientorigin, thenthebrothersmay have found another important clue tohelpthemsolve the Oak Island mystery."
It does seem like rocks have been removed.
That's been cut.
"That's not natural, and this..."
this is pretty loose fill.
"It keeps going for a bit, you can see."
"You... so, you think it goes off to the side?"
At least for a little bit.
Thethingwe obviously want it to be is the entrance to a tunnel.
Andtherewere some evidence of that.
"Hethoughtthreeofthesides  were solid, but on... at least on one side, he thought it might go off, somewhat."
It warrants further investigation.
"So, where should we go?"
Who should we notify?
How do we do this?
"Well, if I was to investigate it as an archaeologist,"
"I'd get a permit, probably remove"
-some of these small trees.
Who are you?
I am Casshern.
"Luna,"
I'm going to kill you.
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
I try to escape this harrowing reality
Everything I hoped for in my life turned out to be an illusion
"A flood of emotions, struggles that lead me astray..."
"I just want to cling onto them and move forward, forward!"
"On these shattered hills, under a sky of rust, you and I are fraught with life like azure flowers"
"We dream that we're bubbles, nestled together, and yet I'm not ready to wither yet!"
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
That's the day the Ruin began.
"From the moment Luna was killed, the world as we knew it began its unstoppable descent towards destruction."
And the name of the man who killed her is Casshern!
Yes.
Casshern!
He must pay the price for what he's done to the world.
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Casshern...
Kill Casshern!
"The harbinger of the Ruin of the world,"
Good.
Let's hear it.
"Well, as suspected,"
Petty Officer Adams' death was caused by a single stab wound.
"The knife perforated his spleen and stomach, resulting in massive internal bleeding."
"The angle of the blade suggests that he was attacked from the front, straight on."
He was face-to-face with his killer.
"So, maybe he knew the person."
They were familiar.
Not necessarily.
Prints that we managed to lift from the body are being analyzed as we speak.
Was there anything unique about the weapon?
Not that I could see.
"No, the-the edges of the wound were precise and clean, with no evidence of a serrated blade."
But Ms. Sciuto is performing further tests on the tissue.
"What about the bruises, Duck?"
"Ah, they're informative, actually."
"They had begun to change color, and that tells me that the fight occurred several hours before his death."
So he fought with someone other than his killer?
It's possible.
It's also possible that the...
Killer came back to finish the job.
Thank you.
"Michael didn't do it, Gibbs."
I never said he did.
"And despite my ties to him,"
I won't try and sway this investigation.
"I never said that, either."
Oh.
"Hey, honey."
"Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't call you back."
"No, I don't think I'm gonna make it home for dinner."
My name is Dayna.
This is Tarrant.
We're Federation outlaws.
Yes.
"Yes, I remember those names."
There was a reward for your capture.
You and your friends have a ship called the Liberator.
- Am I right?
"- We had a ship called the Liberator, it was destroyed fairly recently."
Memory is one of the few faculties I have left that still functions perfectly.
"My name, by the way, is Forbus."
The inventor of Pylene-50.
"Forbus, you weren't really going to press that contact, were you?"
"The explosion would have killed you, too."
That would seem a waste at the present time.
"When I die, I should like Commissioner Sleer right beside me."
"But you work for Sleer, manufacturing Pylene-50."
I am compelled to work for Sleer.
That inhuman devil is the cause of it.
Sleer is responsible for what you see.
"And now, only Sleer keeps me alive."
"What happened, what do you mean?"
Pylene-50 used homoeopathically is simply a muscle relaxant.
"Sleer discovered that 100 times normal dosage totally subverts the will, tried to force me to part with the formula."
I refused.
I didn't understand Sleer's nature then.
"Totally callous, savage ambition."
There is a poison called Tincture of Pyrellic.
- Perhaps you've heard of it?
- No.
"It is the extract of Pamporanian fungi, it cripples and eventually kills."
Death is agonising and there is no cure.
Conservative politician - politicians generally are arguing with each other which is the best situation but nothing ever gets done and they use the argument to delay it.
They probably think Lowestoft doesn't deserve it.
Really?
Yes.
"Of course, the town needs another bridge - everyone agrees on that."
The people can't build it themselves.
It will cost a fortune.
It has to be a political decision.
And the politicians have been squabbling about it for 50 years.
No wonder the people are angry.
"So, the bridge is closing."
"Any minute now, the town is about to get on the move again."
Where's it going?
"Well, nobody's quite sure."
What they are sure of is that they can't rely on the politicians to take them there.
They know that they will have to do it for themselves.
Are they hopeful?
Yeah.
There's plenty of hope.

- Many nasty things have started on paper.
- Who's behind this?
- Ask your generals.
- Benítez is getting impatient out there.
- Ask him in.
We both know that Carrasco is behind this.
He's the only one capable of being a champion of the people.
He is already a legend.
He's being hyped as an immortal.
You know what the people are like.
Get rid of that guy.
"So, General, what unpleasant news have you got today?"

I'm passing on a request from General Gómez.
Out with it.
What does he want?
That's enough now.
Do you hear me?
"Come on, off you go."
"Gómez is convinced he can beat the guerrilleros within two weeks, but in order to carry out this operation, he will need fuel for his planes and artillery."
His pioneers are building a pontoon bridge that we need for our supplies.
That would be a shortcut to Marbella.
"If we manage to create this link, it will be a vital step forward for us."
Will it?
"All right, General, that sounds plausible."
But we can't afford any more defeats.
We're having difficulty financing this war.

And we know he's gonna be watching.
"Well,we're gonna bust him this year."
We've got two agents on the way to last night's crime scene.
Great.
I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
It gets dark early this time of year.
And we'll head to the morgue.
Hope you have a strong stomach.
Gasoline was the accelerant?
"Gas vapors collect in a low,enclosed space."
"When he ignited,those vapors burned down to his bone."
We call this a fourth-degree burn.
- There's a fracture on the back of his skull.
- That's right.
Was that postmortem?
"No,it was antemortem bruising."
He was struck from behind.
Blitz attack.
- What's this on her face?
- Charred fabric.
All of the victims have the same material on them.
"The fire fused the original garment to his flesh, then burned away,leaving behind these remains."
He's covering their faces?
"That's my best guess,yes."
"He doesn't want his victims looking at him, even though we wants to watch them die."
It could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.

What proof?
WARD:
"Lieutenant, there are no fingerprints on that gun."
You said so yourself this morning.
"This has been a rather silly demonstration, Lieutenant."
"Well, you're absolutely right again, sir."
The killer cleaned the gun of all incriminating prints.
"But the thing is, he forgot something."
Forgot what?
"Well, sir, you know that this gun was only used as a prop."
"So, of course, it was never filled with anything but blanks."
"That is, until you stole it, sir."
"And in order to kill Mrs. Daley, you had to remove the blanks and insert real bullets."
"There were no prints on the gun because you wiped the gun clean, sir."
But there is a reason that the lab report took so long.
You remembered to clean the gun.
But you didn't remember to do the same thing with the bullets.
Damn!
I had to forget something.
That's always how the third act ends.
"You see, I've had no rehearsal as a murderer."
"I'm, after all, a detective."
"Yes, sir, but you did kill Claire Daley, didn't you, sir?"
That's what we're trying to find out.
Maybe you can help.
"The only thing they have in common, other than being gifted, is an application to this school."
"As admissions director, you see every application."
You don't think I had something to do with this.
Just want to know how the admission process works.
I'm sure privacy is a major concern here.
Who has access to the applications?
I see them all.
Then I divide them into four groups.
So there's four admissions officers and two assistants.
That's seven of us.
No one else is permitted access.
We'll need to talk to them.
I'm gonna give you a list of dates.
I need you to tell me where you were when... [police radio chatter]
[Car doors close]
Is there a problem?

What is your relationship with that man?

Here is the new update.
"One month ago in our city, the murder case that happened in Haide Industry building, has ne development."

"Well, they looked pretty cozy here."
"Oh... ""It was truly the season to be nice and naughty."""
"""Your little elf, Gillian."""
"Christmas, 2004."
"Ah, they get engaged, they break up."
They get back together.
But she can never quite land him.
Maybe this time she figured out how.
Gillian and Philip applied for a marriage license just two hours after his arraignment.
This is what she bartered her testimony for?
"She wouldn't marry her daughter's killer, would she?"
Love of her life.
She'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
"This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant."
The simulation found that they're vulnerable here.
They've got minimal shielding around their impulse manifolds.

Set me up straight in a chair comb my hair 'cause tonight I'll see an old friend

So what can you tell me about Paul Fordyce?
"Ah, I didn't know him well."
He was something of a recluse.
He was arrogant.
He saw himself as a proper nihilist.
He was into Nietzsche.
"""That which does not kill us makes us strong"" etc."
I had an argument with him about it once in the pub.
He talked about tying to live by those ideals.
He disliked people - he regarded them as his inferiors.
He saw himself as a great man.
Superior to the rim-ram.
"Oh, the bungled and the botched as Nietzsche would say!"
"Well, that explains his arrogance."
Is he seriously under suspicion for three murders though?
"Really, I can't discuss it."
Take a seat.

And when she fell... she struck her head and remained unconscious long enough to drown.

But not about daughters.
"Don't be thick, Da."

"If you don't immediately bring me mutton, you will get eaten!"
"There's a little imp in you, sometimes you can't live without pranks."
Could it be that it amuses you to play the sorcerer for the little boy?
"My dear Doctor, we all play some type of part:"
"I, a sorcerer, you, a scholar who holds nothing dear."
"Every man, if we are to believe Moses, is only a part played by God."
"I would like to know what you know, apart from a few such portrayals?"
Move aside!

A good glass of wine demands also something good to eat.
Wait!
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.

It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."

"""Before something happens""."
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
"All right, then... are they trying to warn me?"
Their motivations... aren't human.
"All right, then what do they want?"
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
"You noticed them, and they noticed that you noticed them."
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
"What happened toyou, Mr. Klein?"
"Last week my friend got a strange phone call... from an entity... a spirit, whatever."
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
"It's perception, John."
They appear differently to everyone.
"A voice, a light, a man, a monster."
"If your friend thinks it's God he spoke to, he's off by more than a few degrees."

You voted against the legalization of cannabis?
Yes.
I figure we have enough vices.
One more wasn't gonna make the world any better.
Have you tried it?
No.
Really?
Never.
And I don't intend to.
I couldn't tell you what it tastes like or something special about a certain plant.
I just-
"- You know, it's just not something I understand."
It's a product.
This is a manufacturing facility.
"We're not making Ford cars, we're making marijuana."
Morris:
"Companies like LivWell are giving marijuana a corporate makeover, and that has some long-time weed growers on edge."
"Mike and Wendy have grown pot for decades, and they push for the right to do it legally."
"But as more big players get into the business, the small-time farmers who started the movement are having trouble competing."
Snip out the very tip top of it.
What strain is this?
This is Purple Train Wreck.
This is one that will help your appetite.
"If we renew our vows at sometime in the future,"
I'm going to use these as a bouquet walking down the aisle.
(laughing)
Mike: 1974.
That's when I planted my first pot plant.
"I baby these girls, each and every one of them every year."
"I mean, look at that thing."
Morris:
Wait.
"Verified, sir."
We must be in some sort of light warp or we would have picked it up earlier.
Put it on visual.
"Iron silica body, planet size-- magnitude 1-E."
We'll be passing close.
Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on our records.
"And yet, here it is."
No time to investigate.
"Science stations, gather data for computer banks."
"Uhura, notify the Discovery on subspace radio."
"A strong interference on subspace, Captain."
The planet must be a natural radio source.
Let's get out of its range.
"Veer 40 degrees to starboard, Mr. Sulu."
40 degrees.
Sulu!
"Mr. Spock, they're gone!"
Emergency!
Full reverse power!
Space-- the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Ship 's log-
- Stardate 2124.5.
First Officer Spock reporting for Captain James Kirk.
We are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert.
"For four hours, we have made every possible instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted for."
I have placed the ship on red alert.
We've searched again from stem to stern.
"If they're not down on that planet, they're now here."
"No sign of human life on the surface, sir, unless the instruments aren't functioning."
- Gotcha.
- Good idea.
I'm going to take them to Dr. Mohadevan.
"Oh, unless of course, you want to do it."
"No, you're perfectly capable."
We can't risk letting Vicki find out about this other vampire.
You don't understand the potential fallout from this conflict.
"You just love to dramatize everything, don't you?"
"This is a two-bit turf war, nothing more."
"This is much more than that, detective."
Fin..
inside.
I'm all ears.
In the late 1700s a vampire ensconced in a Polish village found himself under siege by another vampire who had set out to take over his territory.
And don't tell me.
They both wound up killing ach other.
That would have been preferable.
The newcomer methodically disassembled the life the first vampire had so painstakingly created.
"He killed friends and acquaintances, lovers."
Those closest to him were the first to die.
Which one were you?
The one still alive.
The rest of the village?
"You're not exactly winning me over here, Fitzroy."
Just be careful how you act around her.
The less suspicion we arise in her the better.
"If the other vampire believes she's with me,"
Vicki will most certainly die.
"Well, speaking of aroused suspicions, do you often stand her up to go meet with your editor in the middle of the night?"
Point taken.
What do you have?
Her name was Gabriel Claremont.
Or would his talent have been buried  in some graphic design studio sketching commercial ads?
"Pavlos remained a true artist, a bohemian, who never cared about being broke, and being broke was his permanent condition."
since great artists' works become priceless usually only after their death...
"Such was the case when he remembered his forgotten gold sovereign in the pot, the sovereign that had united him and Aliki once upon a New Year's Day..."
How many memories it brought back!
And the sovereign?
The sovereign was still there.
"No use keeping it any more, though."
Hello!
Can you please change this sovereign for me?
"- It's counterfeit, unfortunately."
- Counterfeit?
All right then...
Counterfeit?
He couldn't help it.
He would be just penniless for yet another day...
He couldn't care less as long as he could enjoy the autumn sunshine... and head to Zappeion Park to browse around a new painting exhibition...
Pavlos!
Aliki!
"How are you, Pavlos?"
"Long time, no see."
"Yes, it's been too long."
We never happened to meet.
"Is it too late for me now, 7 years later, to apologize for what I said to you in that gallery?"
Your first exhibition.
I feel terribly guilty for the things I said.
Well...
when I saw you with....
He was my husband.
"Yes, I know."
You must have hated me that day.
"I didn't hate you, Pavlos."
- Take it up.
"- Come on, poor babe."
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens to be thy nurses.
"Please, your highness, posts from those you sent to the oracle are me."
"'Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia"
'Thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason
"""In committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia. '"
"You, my lord, best know"
"My past life hath been as continent, as chaste, as true"
As I am now unhappy.
"Your Honours, I do refer me to the oracle, Apollo be my judge."
This your request is altogether just
The Emperor of Russia was my father
O that he were alive and here beholding his daughter's trial!
That he did but see the ﬂatness of my misery
Yet with eyes of pity. not revenge.
- Break up the seals and read...
- 'Hermione is chaste. '
'Polixenes blameless. '
"'Camille a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant"
His innocent babe truly begotten
'And the King shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found. '
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
There is no truth at all in the oracle.
"The session shall proceed, this is mere falsehood."
"My lord the King, your son is gone."
How?
Gone?
Is dead.
Apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strilce at my injustice.
This news is mortal to the queen.
Look down and see what death is doing.
You know Marbella better than anyone else.
You told Mariá that you were that garrison's chaplain for years.
Nobody would suspect anything if you went to visit them now.
I'm not sure if I can reconcile this with the priesthood.
Can you reconcile the suffering of your people with the priesthood?
No one else can make this decision for you.
"Lord, I hope You will forgive me."
"All right, I'll help you."
Why are you doing it?
Would you have dropped your plan otherwise?
- No.
- I knew that.
These are old photographs of the refinery.
You might know if anything has changed.
We only have a small amount of explosives.
We can't afford any mistakes.
So that's what you studied engineering for.
I might rebuild tomorrow what I destroy today.
- Let's continue.
- The chaplain goes there every Sunday.
- He needs a special permit to get inside.
- How does one get there?
Only by tanker train.
There's a small town with a station near the refinery.
"That's where the chaplain lives, and that's where he takes the train."
"/f you calculated exactly how long the train takes, you could blow up individual wagons wherever you want."
Attaching the explosives is dead easy.
The only problem is getting out of this alive.
/ see.
Wait a minute.
I think it's that way.
Can I help you?
Well it was a poor exchange for an empty bed!
"This wretched vow of virginity was your choice, not mine."
This marriage was when?
A year since past.
Was she still in my service when it began?
After she left...when?
In your service.
"It was...for comfort, Bess, it was a diversion."
And when she left my court to marry Walter Devereux did you still partake of her comfort?
How fortuitous for you both he died so suddenly.
"Her son, who bears Devereux's name .."
"he too is called Robert, is it not?"
"Does he have dark eyes, like you?"
"Such a rank insinuation is unworthy of you, Bess."
"The bond we shared was like no other, Robbie."
You have defied it.
"So what's it to be banishment again, Bess?"
Another... mission abroad?
"Henceforth, if I see you, I shall not know you."
You are dead to me.
"Look on her well, Lettice, for there true loyalty lies,"
"It is a pity you did not learn from Kat's example, is it not?"
"I am heart broke,"
"Your Majesty, that.. we have so incurred your displeasure."
and as we can not always choose where loves arrows falls.
"Such sentimental claptrap finds no favor with me, madam."
Get up!
Imported silk?
From France.
The color is too vulgar for my taste.
Gold?
I'm been told you also run a lavish household.
Can it be made operational?
"The interesting thing is, as far as I can see, that all this damage was done but for one purpose:"
"To prevent the orbiting flight pattern, which you are now in from being altered."
I don't understand any of this.
"First the trouble with the communicators, and now sabotage."
What happened to the communicators?
Just after we started back on the return trip there was a burnout in the main circuits.
"Grovane, the communications officer, thought the damage couldn't be accidental."
"Apparently, all the safety circuits were still intact, they'd been bypassed somehow."
It's still not working.
"This man Dortmunn they're looking for, could he have any reason to sabotage you?"
None that I can think of.
He's a fine man and a first class engineer.
[COMMUNICATOR CHIME]
Kendall.
Mandrian.
"We're in section 9, Doctor, you'd better come down."
There's something you should see.
Lead the way.
- This is a pity.
- What is it?
The Ison crystal.
"Even if we get the ship operational, it'll be blind."
"With this fractured, there isn't a chance of outside vision."
What have you found?
Life Rocket Two has been launched.
That explains where Dortmunn got to.
He's taking a tremendous chance.
Those life rockets have a limited range.
It certainly couldn't carry him to the nearest habitable planet.
But why?
Why would he do that?
- 18 dead.
- Minus 4 Germans.
Most below deck.
"Third class, probably trapped in the dark, if they didn't get caught by the explosion."
There was a man on deck who got crushed to death by train coaches   trying to get a lifeboat out.
But most went into the water without a life jacket and drowned.
"The only boat that was used was the one that was on starboard's side, and that holds only 8."
"Well, Head Office are very pleased."
They consider heavy water operations finished.
"""An example on precise warfare with a minimal amount of casualties -"""
"""- which has given us a huge advantage in our continuous battles."""
That's Churchill.
He sends his congratulations.
Congratulation...
Sir.

Werner Heisenberg!
Don't leave.
"Wait for me, please!"
Damn!
"370 wives or mistresses, or whatever..."
"They always start out with how they don't know anything about physics,   but that they find it interesting."
"""Culture and science is Germany's greatest strength."""
Then moving on to the weather and other unimportant stuff.
"For example, ""strategic withdrawal."""
"We withdraw with success and show ""victorious resistance""."
But I like you.
I've always liked you.
I want you to know that.
You are not one of those who give up so easily.
"Follow me, I want to show you something."
You're not the only one who's been busy!
All is calm on the water according to reconnaissance.
The archery competition between Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops was completed as scheduled.
The results of the battle formation drills are satisfactory as well.
"We've completed spread formation and single file formation drills, so we'd like to begin the overlapping reversed V formation drills tomorrow."
"Well done, everyone."
"Oh, at any rate, when will the High Commander be back with us?"
I'm getting so anxious waiting for him...
Sir.
"Was the artillery training conducted on land again, Captain Chung?"
Yes.
I believe my Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops are scheduled for an onboard artillery training tomorrow.
There will be no training onboard.
Captain Chung!
"Let me make it clear, Constable Kwon."
There will be no more naval training as far as the artillery is concerned.
Ensign Chung!
"Yes, sir."
I want the cannons mounted on Soon-chun and Kwang-yang galleys tomorrow.
Constable Kwon!
I will do it.
"From now on, I will conduct the artillery training."
The High Commander is wrong!
He's making a bad mistake!
You have got to stop confusing the soldiers by blindly following the
High Commander!
We are trying to do our duty as naval officers of Left Cholla.
Constable Kwon!
Have the cannons mounted by 09:00!
"Yes, sir!"
Give it up now.
Some things are just not possible.
We have to reduce the weight of the iron plates.
Let's go Nilüfer
Did you entrust the kids to Esma?
"My princess, what happened?"
What did you talk about?
Will he release us?
Sultan..
Barbarian Sultan
"He thinks he can lock up a princess, even a princess of Holy Roman Empire"
He'll pay for it
What did he tell you?
Why are you so angry?
As you see she's pretty angry your Majesty
It is normal to be angry for being a captive
What's your decision?
What do we do?
Will you release the princess?
She'll keep staying here
Let's see what she'll bring us
"Let's see what her father, her fiance that she relis on will do"
Do everything for her comfort İbrahim
Make sure she's being hosted in the best way
She'll be more important every each day she stays here
Prince Friedrich;
"I am sad to inform you about that your fiance, Princess Isabella's ship was attacked and captured by Turkish pirates"
Your fiance who was captured by the pirates has been brought to İstanbul
Despite all my efforts the pirates refused all the golds I offered
Princess is sold to Sultan Süleyman
She's held in a hunting lodge in Haliç.
ut don't worry.
I keep an eye on her
I feel as I owe to inform you about this situation to end thiscaptivity
She's waiting to be rescued
- What are you doing in my pit?
- I'm sorry.
"- Jesus, leave the poor girl alone, Rebecca."
Time for your medication.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Nurse Oaks?
"- I'm sorry, Miss Porter."
The door was supposed to be locked.
"Right this way, please."
I heard you found your way into what the... staff so lovingly calls the pit.
Were you lost?
- No.
I...
I'd heard stories.
It was foolish of me.
I'm sorry.
I was... simply curious.
- Don't apologize for your curiosity.
What'd you think when you were... faced with the reality of the healing process?
- The reality of...
I don't understand.
"- We live in times that are rife with ill mental health, especially among the upper class."
"To be blunt, we are a decadent people."
This leads to a... imbalance as the mind and the flesh... fall out of rhythm with the animal instincts.
"These... women that... prance around as if this were a social club rather than... one of the world's foremost institutions of mental science, they don't want to heal."
We let them parade around in their ridiculous costumes as they live out their lives out of joint with the rest of the world.
"On the other hand, there are some women here who have embraced their own healing."
- The women in... the pit?
- Yes.
That is what true healing looks like.
- It's very different than what I imagined.
- What's wrong?
- One second.
Hey!
Run softer!
Learn how to run the right way!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
The American investors were threatening to withdraw on us.
"But we're good, since Representative Yoon brought those Chinese people here."
Our Representative Yoon...
has the right mentality.
"I was a little bit uncertain, honestly..."
Because I'm not sure how much Hong Gyu Man can cover up for us.
Weren't you constantly negotiating with Chief Jung?
This person?
He wouldn't tell me.
Whether we can break the legs of about ten tenants who refuse to leave.
Or if we can light the entire district on fire until there isn't anything left.
And whether or not Hong Gyu Man would be able to cover that up.
What do you think?
Would you be able to cover that up?
Or not?
"Once we build the Hallyu Core Mall we will profit one trillion won immediately, upon completion."
Between people who manipulate trillions of dollars in order to boost our economy and people who make 20 to 30 million won per year...
Who is more important?
Even the ones in power don't have this much ambition...
That's why our country is in this state.
"The drive to place our country's economy as a top priority, is severely lacking."
Hong Gyu Man.
Yes?
With the profits we gain from the Hallyu Core Mall
I plan to use those funds when my father retires.
There are three good reasons for anyone not to like him.
"He has a point, all the same."
- About Tarrant?
- (Chuckling) About the ship.
It was never designed to tangle with Federation cruisers.
"Oh, I'm working on them."
- You are?
- With Orac's help.
These old freighters are fitted with short-burn boosters to help get their payloads into orbit.
Orac is figuring out a way to redesign them to give us extra in-flight speed.
- I thought he was keeping unusually silent.
- Probably sulking.
One of the almost human things about Orac is that it does not like to work.
- Orac.
"- Yes, Avon."
- Any progress with the booster problem?
- There has been no reply yet.
"What do you mean, no reply?"
I passed the programme to computers specialising in engineering design.
- You mean you can't handle it yourself?
- The art of leadership is delegation.
"They'll push out a patrol to check our casualties, so you'll have a chance to catch them in the open for once."
"Now, bait the ground well, and then deploy the rest of the column beyond Post 3."
- Any questions?
"- We'll be in the open, too."
If they send in gunships we'll be cut to pieces.
Take them by surprise.
Hit hard and they'll have no time to call gunships.
"And then you get out again fast, all right?"
- MAN:
Prisoners?
- We don't take prisoners.
This crew still thinks they're working for John.
"Well, how are we feeling today?"
"If you're implying I'm a split personality, both of us are fine."
"You know, I just came from visiting a dual personality."
Both of them feel terrible.
"You, you're doing very nicely."
Does that mean you're going to let me out of here?
"Well, what's wrong with this place?"
"It's quiet, pleasant."
You have leisure time to paint.
May I look?
It isn't finished yet.
"Oh, it's unusual, certainly."
What do you call it?
I haven't quite decided whether to call it Modern Living or simply Biography.
I see.
"Tell me, John, just what were you trying to interpret here?"
How do I know?
I'm a loony.
"There it is, Mr. Skinner."
Your capital position is badly impaired due to the heavy investment which is frozen in inventory.
Just give it to me in basic English.
"Very well, Mr. Skinner."
"Unless there is a drastic increase in sales, and a liquidation of your past due accounts receivable, the company is going to be insolvent in approximately three months."
Three months?
"Well, I'll need at least a year."
Then I'd suggest you obtaining additional capital.
On what?
The name John Brown and Company has always been sufficient collateral.
Maybe John Brown could get a loan.
The company can't borrow a dime.
These are the debits.
Only vitality guarantees success!
I am a man who knows only one thing!
Strike!
Strike!
And strike again!
"The first time, mein Führer, I heard you speak, you looked at me."
"Your blue eyes met my glance, like a flame."
This was a command.
"At that moment, I was reborn."
I knew which road to take.
At last... an epic worth writing.
"But only you, a failed playwright, to write it."
"And you, a failed artist to act it."
"The grander your grandiosity, the more brutal and grotesque."
The propaganda had to be the height of ruth!
"Because it doesn't matter if an idea is true or false, as long as it serves my purposes."
But members of your family suffered from mental illness.
Didn't you fear insanity?
I wasn't put in a lunatic asylum.
I created a lunatic asylum.
The war would never have started if it wasn't for the Jews... and their puppet
Churchill.
( mimics Churchill ) We will fight them on the landing strips.
We will fight them on the beaches.
We will fight them wherever the enemy invaded us.
I dealt with pain by causing pain.
No!
Cross that out!
"It's a ridiculous notion, that personal pain causes one man to injure another."
"To protect Germany, an act of self-defense."
To guarantee my singular place in history.
To punish the German nation for undermining my charisma.
But then...
"Russia-- invincibility undone, the circle of my perfection crushed under the boots of Slavs, no less."
Stalinites!
The Führer Myth... shattered.
A quarter million of my young soldiers slaughtered in the snow.
My most humiliating experience.
I was naked before the German people... the world.
"And then, I had to continue with my role to take the stage again."
Only my will allowed me to remain in character.
"A childhood nightmare returned-- running home naked from school in the snow, hiding behind bushes, trying to avoid being seen, to avoid ridicule, exposure."
I pondered the many options.
Calling a world conference for peace.
"I could be ""The Great Peacemaker,"""
voluntarily withdrawing to our own borders.
We would keep only...
Austria.
"I considered retiring, going back to my painting."
"I longed to paint, to create, to build."
I should have been an architect.
"Has a great ruler ever simply disappeared from the public stage, changed his identity?"
"""Let someone else play Hitler,"" l thought,"
"""Give someone else the role!"""
But the stain of defeat would not fade.
And then... it came to me.
"Slowly at first, like a-- a blossom on tree in spring."
What I could do next.
( nervous breathing )
"An old image-- a primal hatred, crystallized."
The answer.
It obsessed me and lifted my spirits.
A new plan for these terrible times.
"It was the one thought, the one idea, that brought me peace enough to sleep."
"You know, one in seven American cancer and die."
"You know, one in seven American men gets prostate cancer."
"You know, one in seven American men gets prostate cancer."
Prostatecancer.
men gets prostate cancer.
Prostatecancer.
"I know, you tell me every time"
Prostatecancer.
"I know, you tell me every time we hang out."
"I know, you tell me every time we hang out."

So here's the problem.
to read it to you.
So here's the problem.
Patients and their doctors most
So here's the problem.
Patients and their doctors most often don't have conversations
"Patients and their doctors most often don't have conversations about when the burdens of often don't have conversations about when the burdens of treatment would be so high, about when the burdens of treatment would be so high, they wouldn't outweigh"
"treatment would be so high, they wouldn't outweigh the benefits of treatment."
they wouldn't outweigh the benefits of treatment.
"I, too, believe it's illusions about love and the emphasis on sex that separate people today."
"As you said, romance is a myth, a manipulation."
I was referring to academic opinions that are purely subjective.
You were right!
Relationships that are based on romantic love are worthless.
"There's no point to them, they have no value."
Did you stay for my whole class?
I left when you were talking about the music we hear when lovers kiss in the movies.
It is manipulative!
"In real life, we don't hear music when we kiss."
And the person you're with isn't a movie star.
It's a malicious...
Fantasy?
Is it all right if I sit down for a minute?
The addiction to beauty and perfection created by advertising feeds on people's pathetic desires.
They don't have their own opinions anymore.
The media tells us what's beautiful and what's not.
TV shows tell us what a relationship is supposed to be like.
And sex!
- I don't even want to tell you how that's ruined my life...
"- Oh, no."
Go ahead.
Tell me.
"- Well, I go crazy."
- Really?
Yeah?
"When I want someone sexually, I go out of my mind."
Do you remember that movie where the woman kills the bunny?
- Fatal Attraction?
"- Granted, it was a film."
I can understand what she went through.
Not that I would kill an animal.
"Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair."

"Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery, Kat."
"Tara, I was extremely disappointed that you were involved in last night's idiocy."
I had no option.
To be distracted when your recovery has put you so far behind.
What happened to finding your inner anger?
Miss Raine's right
"- I need to put my head down, work harder."
"Are you thick, woman?"
You exposed an abusive teacher and your dad is close to suing the academy.
"If that's not a get-out-of-jail-free card, I don't know what is."
"So... so we're not one of those vomit-inducing couples,"
I was thinking we should introduce some guidelines for behaviour.
Guidelines?
It could be fun.
"Just on obvious stuff, like a limit on PDAs, and no holding hands."
We're both capable of walking unaccompanied.
I'll give you two hours before you crack.
You're not that irresistible.

"Except you, Tara."

They probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet.
"According to Phlox, the Insectoids we found weren't killed in the crash... they suffocated?"

They sacrificed themselves to save their children.
You said the hatchery is losing bio-support.
How long will it last?
"Another day, at most."
I want you to assign a team to repair it.
-Captain?
-What about Azati Prime?
It's not going anywhere.
This is a sentient species.
We can't abandon them.
"Captain, with all due respect, why the hell not?"
I've got half a mind to take a plasma torch to that place.
What if we found a nursery filled with 31 infant Primates?
Would you want to torch them?
ARCHER:
Such devastation...
But...
True change arises from confusion and destruction.
"Don't you agree, Mr. Yonamine?"
Chief Kato...
A mysterious high energy reaction that instantaneously swallowed up thousands of lives...
It just thrills me to pieces...
One can only hope that this is a sign that'll point us to the path we must take for the future.
Negative readings on both residual radiation and radioactivity.
Troops will now begin examining the center of the explosion.
Chief!
Look at that!
"Chief, we have a report on Miya Shikitani from the medical team."
Has she awoken?
Huh?
Well...
"I'm asking you, if she's up or not."
I don't need to hear every single progress report!
Clearly this is a mechanism made from a technology not found on this earth.
The only survivor...
And the mysterious woman.
They're all keys to solving that incident.
The giant monster and the white giant that appeared in Shinjuku that day...
"In order to figure out who they are and why they came, our agency Agwarda was created for the future."
We will get to the bottom of this.
Without fail!
"What do you mean, they need to discuss a possible shutdown?"
A total waste of money...?
What does the Foundation know anyway?
We just need the right opportunity!
We have all the necessary conditions in place!
A gentle push and the wheels will start spinning...
And since I'm mentioning that...
Isn't that when you'll be in charge?
"Through Chief Jung, I will make sure we take extra precautions."
"There's a problem with your attitude, Hong Gyu Man."
Those friends over there join forces to push out companies like San Ah Group...
"Hong Gyu Man, are you really keeping us in mind constantly?"
"Or, do you want to skip becoming Prime Minister... and go up there, instead?"
- Definitely not...
- That's what I thought.
I have yet to hear from my father... about how arrogant you are.
You...
Do you have some moral lines that you're not able to cross?
I don't.
Then...
Why are you not helping Yoon Sang Min properly?
I will pay more attention to it.
Pay more attention?
Is this a matter of paying attention?
Don't you know what happens when you turn against the New York Study Group?
"The Prime Minister position, and everything else, will fly away."
"We'll be disposed of our luxury of being alive, just like that."
Don't you know how important this is?
Go Moon...
I have something I'm curious about.
You killed my junior colleague...
- Whose request was it?
- Don't try to find out.
Things will get harder for you.
"Three years ago, when the mission in Macau was recalled..."
Was it the request of New York Study Group?
This little...
Are you still hung up on that?
"And lo, I bring the warlike host of Spain"
In fair review before King Agramant.
"I, Soridan, come with my martial train,"
Who may almost a giant's stature vaunt;
Marsilio with the men of Setta ride;
The Nasamonians troop with Pulian.
"And faithful Sobrino take to thy side,"
Who from far away brings many a man.
"Rodomont, of Sarza, king of Algiers,"
"For thy glory, Agramant, I anew"
Brought up a band of foot and cavaliers.
A new-made king after me comes behind.
"Dardinello is my name, which is signed."
"The fierce Mandricardo, king of the Tartars, is also moving towards Paris."
"But while on the road, he runs into Doralice's procession,"
"Rodomont's fiancée, bound to reach her cavalier in the city under siege."
"Where the deep stream is fordable, I've scanned"
A crowd of cavaliers that armour bear:
"Ye, all!"
I do now question:
"who hath manned,"
"With such a troop, and to what end, the square?"
"In charge, I say, we of the daughter go"
"Of him our king, who fills Granada's throne,"
"Espoused by Rodomont of Sarza, oh!"
And we shall bring her where her father keeps
In the Spanish camp;
meanwhile the lady sleeps.
"This Doralice, by what I hear, is fair."
"Fain would I now be certified, how fair:"
"Then me to her, or her to me convey,"
For I must quickly wend another way.
You will be a hero in the world!
I'm not interested.
"Did you find out, where do the other bastards hide?"
"Oh, come on, Bishop!"
We know they are breeding like rabbits for decades.
"Why do you put your hologram and find it yourself, Trajan?"
"Come on Bishop, if you do not want to cooperate  we can always extract your information from your neuro-implant."
If required.
Is that what you told my wife?
Before he murdered her?
"It was never personal, Bishop!"
But humanoid reproduction is a capital offense.
The scientific ambition of your wife was the death sentence.
This is why the human race takes precedence for its petty grievances.
"I've died 1,000 times to catch you, Trajan."
"And I will die a thousand times more, to see your head on a stake!"
"I trained you well, Bushio..."
too well!
I guess you're already dead.
That would have saved me a lot of trouble.
That would have cleared this difficult situation.
"Sorry to disappoint you, General."
Check the body.
"He is our man, General."
"Ash-393 is dead, Mr."
Excellent.
The Federation has become a little more secure.
Give us the coordinates of the humanoid settlement!
Or get ready for a lobotomy!
"I do not think so, Trajan."
Let's see if your implants survive a grenade explosion.
"Come now, Commander you have known, how this will end."
He's displaying signs of paranoia.
I think you're overstating things just a little.
You can't allow him to use our antimatter.
"What do you suggest I do, start a mutiny?"
You have to speak with Phlox.
Ask him to run a full exam on the Captain.
What good would that do?
"If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical grounds to relieve him of command."
Relieve him?
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened, but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before their reactor's brought on-line?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know that he's endangering this ship and our mission.
What is it?
A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
Tactical alert.
"Captain Archer, report to the bridge."
It's an Insectoid... three bio-signs aboard.
They're firing!
They're moving away at full impulse.
Pursuit course.
Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.
No effect.
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.
"Torpedoes, maximum yield."
Target their impulse manifolds.
Which contains only pure blood.
"Who are racially pure people and conscious of their blood,"
He can never be a slave.
In this world will always be bastard and bastard alone.
Humanoid mutants are fully capable of reproducing different types.
That is the only thing that the creator did well.
"Are you doing something deep, not Kix?"
"""Does that book teach you all that?"""
-Open mind.
"It helps me understand, what I do."
Every single mutant must be exterminated for the human race to survive.
"Let's put it as data in the briefcase, Kix."
Your psycho propaganda bothered me.
Adolf Hitler was an unknown prophet.
Your message is our salvation!
"You have real damage, Kix."
"""We will have to fight for the freedom and the independence of the homeland"
"Only in this way can the people fulfill the task, which they received from the Creator. """
There is no 'homeland' anymore.
"It's just what we left, that's all that's left."
The atmosphere was destroyed by us.
No one else is to blame.
"And the asteroid, Bishop?"
It was in the crater.
I saw it with my own eyes.
It looks more like an atomic bomb to me.
It was an internal job...
That is always.
Humanity is responsible for the eternal winter.
"Not God, or humanoids."
It will no longer be a time hunted by the shadows of your own guilt.
"It can eradicate parasites. """
"Now, if my suspicions are sustained, I won't wait for a formal hearing:"
I'll have you summarily executed:
"Guards, take him away:!"
"Why, good afternoon, Captain Rogers, Hawk:"
I trust your excursion to Vor-Deeth was a pleasant one:
"Crichton, I can't believe this:"
You're actually being courteous today?
"But why shouldn't I be, sir?"
"After all, a robot owes his human masters every measure of respect:"
[Chuckles] You mean you are acknowledging that we are your masters?
"You created us, did you not?"
"- How about you, Twiki?"
"- What do you mean, how about me?"
Are we playing guessing games?
"Twiki, are you all right?"
What do you care?
What do any of you care?
Since when have you humans been overly concerned about how I feel?
All I am is a mechanical servant:
"Now if you'll excuse me, I've been summoned to the bridge:"
The admiral probably expects me to fix him a cup of tea: : :
Or something equally important:
Ha!
I don't know what they want me to do:
Always asking me to do something:
Have a most pleasant day:
"[Twiki] Twiki do this, Twiki, do that:"
"It's discrimination, if you ask me:"
I think they're both out of their heads:
Incredible:
Their personalities are completely transformed:
"Yeah, I think we better get to that sick bay as quickly as possible:"
The boss makes his appearance.
"I beg your pardon, Your Majesty."
But he also worries about the kingdom.
I understand.
Don't worry about it.
"As such, how do you plan to deal with this revolt?"
I have high hopes for a prompt response.
A prompt response?
It's only been two days since we first received notice.
We don't even know the rebel army's stronghold or their ringleader.
He's an irritating bastard.
Countermeasures have already been arranged.
We've done research on the ringleader of the revolt.
"The only daughter of the old king of Estabul, Lady Noa Ehn."
Colonel Miran Froaude will fill you in on the information he gathered.
"According to our information, the Estabul side has roughly fifty thousand soldiers."
- Fifty thousand!
- That goes beyond any revolt.
It's a war!
It is likely that territories adjacent to Estabul will be caught in the fighting.
"For the time being, we'd like to have them evacuated to this castle."
We shall be certain to protect all of your territories.
You say to leave our territory?
!
Are you lot saying you would trample our lands?
I will never permit it!
Do you have something you would prefer we did not see?
C-Certainly not...
"You are free to remain there if you prefer, of course."
Estabul's forces are only fifty thousand at most.
"Nothing to fear, surely."
"Your Majesty, I will be taking the army."
Can't you tell him to give money?
He is also your brother What harm has he done to you?
Please take it Why do you..?
"It is alright, please take it Have it"
On condition the accused Arul Kumaran must report to the..
"..concerned police station signregisters,Ireleasehimonbail"

Why an auto?
Our vehicle is there
"Your job is over I will take care of the rest, you go"
Why do you send home now?
Are you concerned about my family?
Please listen to me
I know you can counter 1 0 opponents simultaneously
But whom have you beaten this time?
-Brother of the one who holds the reign of this state
-You are right
"The proverb 'with uncle's help you can climb hill' is right, come on"
Come dear
How did you stay for 4 days inside the police station?
I am not worried about 4 days confinement
No one came to see me at least for one day
That makes me sad what wrong I have done?
"If I haven't hit him, he would have killed me"
- Then would you all been happy?
- Don't talk like that son

But this cow is diseased and very weak.
"""This cow has slept."
"-No, it has sacrified its life"""
Very bad thing has happened?
-What will happen now?
"""Mother cow, what sin have I committed that you came and..."""

The division staff is on the line.
"Comrade colonel, it is lnozemtsev reporting."
-The pawn has reached the last line.
- l got it.
Now let it keep the positions with all possible might.
"Comrade colonel, Malyutin is preventing the enemyfrom unwrapping into the battle formation."
and adjusting the friendly artilleryfire.
The communication with him now is off.
"Put me through to the front staff operative section, quickly ls the enemy advancing at the main direction?"
There is a considerable advance.
Our last data shows that the Germans are rushing theirtank reserves to our breakthrough point at Hill 89.
"lnozemtsev, you are right as always."
"Comrade colonel, the Army staff is on the line."
"Comrade general, Yegorov reporting."
The Germans moved their mobile reserves in.
-The offensive is on the verge of defaulting.
- l can see that.
What can you suggest?
"While lnozemtsev is keeping this hill, we still have chances."
"Your suggestions, please."
"First, to move the fire of the corps artilleryto the hill."
Your point taken.
"Second, immediately move ourtank reserves in."
The Germans are about to close the breakthrough at the key section ofthe main advance direction.
- Right.
"- lt is the onlyway out, comrade general."
"Wait forthe final decision, and in the meantime support lnozemtsev."
"- Report to me every 10, no, every 5 minutes."
-All right.
- lnozemtsev!
"-Yes, mayor."
I'm urgently moving mytanks from the road to the positions ofyour regiment.
--It was Vasin's idea...
--And now it was more appropriate to give the owners some time
"Understood, Igor Igor'evich"
--Zinaida Petrovna --Yes
--Immediately halt the demolition of garages --Is that an order?
Consider it an order
Pavel Ivanovich had asked that such an order must be in writing
What for?
Starting a paper trail?
There's a paper shortage in our country as it is.
To have an official document for why those wrecks are still standing
"Alright, I'll get you a written document"
--Hello --One minute
--Hello --Is this the communal department?
--Yes --I'm calling about the garage
"Comrades, your children will play on green grass in that spot"
--One minute please --This garage hardly bothers anyone
I'm not authorized to change the management's decision
So sorry
What's this I hear about our Vasin going rabid mad?
I told you he was kicked out of the house
"Last night called me all enraged, asking who I lived with, and could he spend the night over"
"Please stop your gossip, nobody wants to know that"
Don't shout at me
I told you that this is all under Sorokin's authority
Yes.
Hello?
"Pavel Ivanovich, is it true what they say that now all dogs will be walked behind the far lake?"
--They will --How will they get there?
"--Individually, or on an express bus?"
--They'll get their on their own
--Go straight here --I'll take Lomonosov str.
"- Yes, sir"
"Thank you very much, God willing, I'll live up to your expectations"
- Who shall I say it is?
"- Rabab, he's expecting me"
Welcome
How beautiful!
"Come in, whoever comes in here becomes a member of the house"
- Is this a house?
- A house... or an office...
"It's a safe place, comfortable and cozy"
I was afraid you wouldn't come
I always keep my promises
- And who is this?
"- My father, rest his soul"
- He looks like a real Pasha
"- Of course, what did you think?"
That I was a fake Pasha?
This picture is of my dad in the hall of the regal palace... after taking the oath in front of the king...
Ice?
It was the first time he heads the Ministry of Public Works
"That's why I agreed to come, to have something I can be proud of"
I can say I knew a real Pasha
"Instead of the misery I'm in, you see the people at the bar"
You're so cute
"But I've no luck, Pasha"
Where's the toilette?
"Oh, when you go out, it'll be on your right"
Excuse me
"Everything is set, I'll go out for a couple of hours"
"I'll meet my brother Malak, there's something we're taking care of"

"You know, the problem is, we can't figure out which banks contracted with Arsenal for the system."
Hoped Bank Robbery Task Force database might have that information.
Let me see.
Checked all local banks-- no issues and they're all closed for the day now.
"Yeah, and all the armored trucks are in and accounted for."
"Look, we're..."

Did you check Federal Reserve trucks?
The Reserve?
"No way these guys are crazy enough to go after the feds, are they?"

Patton still tracking the armored truck?
SONJA:
They haven't hacked into it yet.
The truck's still moving.
Half mile ahead.

Crew could be monitoring police communications.
"Isabel, you love venice this time of year."

The point of the Gigafactory is to get the cost of batteries down to the point where it's affordable.
DICAPRIO:
Right.
MUSK:
Batteries are critical to the sustainable energy future.
"The sun doesn't shine all the time, so, you've got to store it in a battery."
DICAPRIO:
How is this gonna help developing nations that have massive populations that need to have power?
MUSK:
"So, the advantage of solar and batteries is that you can avoid building electricity plants at all."
"So you could be in a remote village and have solar panels that charge a battery pack, that then supplies power to the, to the whole village, without ever having to run thousands of miles of high voltage cable over the place."
"It's like, what happened with landline phones versus cellular phones, in a lot of developed countries they just didn't do the landline phones, they just went straight to cellular."

What kind of throughput would you actually need?
"Um, and you'd need 100 gigafactories."
So.
DICAPRIO: 100 of these?
"MUSK: 100 of these, yes."

Summary of the previous installment
A month had past since I noticed Big Sis's (Bon's) first Boys Love (BL) manga... submitted to the Comic Market was exposed online and horribly mocked
"During this time, Big Sis freaked out over not being able to contact her best friend..."
A sex slave living with her boyfriend in Tokyo
This made her think of something ridiculous.
"""The Sex Slave Rescue Mission"""
The mission was to charge into their love nest and steal her back
I fought against this for three days and three nights... but ended up being dragged onto an overnight bus headed for Tokyo
"We were supposed to meet Bebi-chan, Big Sis's online friend and... contributor of this mission, but she had forgotten... she was supposed to buy a BL manga that she recommended for him"
We rushed ourselves to the shop with a sea of BL fanzines...

Just an assumption
Miyu likes wimpy and skinny boys
Much like Lin right now
She is a sex slave with a lot of motherly love
A cute girl with a lot of motherly love...
That's nice
Yeah
But her motherly love is now conquered by her sexuality

"WRONGFUL conviction, and you haven't actually said sorry."
"Maybe you'll do better, DS Arnott."

Your allegation that I planted incriminating evidence against you is false.
Point of information -- I've made two allegations.

"And, two, you planted £50,000 to simulate a bribe."

Why are you coming out and saying glyphosate
Could cause cancer?
One of the main reasons for a difference is just that there's more evidence
That accumulates over time.
And I think it's an important message to get out.
Why don't we do these studies
And begin to better understand
Whether there are such health effects?
Yeung:
So monsanto's response is that you guys
"Have been cherry-picking your data,"
"That this is inconsistent with decades of previous studies,"
And that it's an agenda-driven process.
What do you make of that?
It's a rock-solid process.
Classifying anything as a carcinogen
Is a warning flag for all of us.
Yeung:
As genetically modified crops continue to spread
"Across the world, they have become staple ingredients in a lot of our processed foods"
And in the feed for our livestock and poultry.
While the european union and many other developed nations have laws
"Requiring foods with gmo ingredients to be labeled,"
The u.S. Has no such law.
"If companies like monsanto are so very proud of this,"
"They ought to label it for the consumer, just like they do in russia and china."
This is our food supply.
This is about what we're feeding our kids.
And I think that gives the consumers the ability to make a decision
"Thou needs art raving mad, of mind awry."
Wilt thou perhaps my rightful road deny?
"He's foul with blood, I mark his felon cheer;"
I raise piercing shrieks to the sky in fear.
"Oh, Doralice.."
When that fair face now so close before me
"I see, which has no paragon in Spain,"
I know not if in heaven or earth I be;
Is twisted Love's inextricable chain.
"Mandricardo's sweet words, which flow with art,"
Love frames and dictates to the Tartar knight.
They sweetly tend to cheer my afflicted heart.
I am already less disturbed with fright.
"By these, fear first is laid, and next the smart"
"Sheathed of that woe, which had nigh pierced my sprite;"
And with more patience now I feel I can
"Him hear, and my new lover's reasons scan."
"I say, how woe-begone will be thy sire,"
When he the miserable case shall hear!
What grief will be the bridegroom's!
What his ire!
How dread the vengeance of that cavalier!
"I, dames, maids, ancient men, and others, who"
"Have from Granada with the damsel fared,"
"Kindly dismiss, your journey to pursue;"
"I say, my care suffices;"
I of guard
"Of guide, of handmaid will the office do,"
To serve her in her every need prepared.
"I, Charlemagne, by priest and friar black, gray"
"And white, bid celebrate mass-rite and prayer;"
"And the folk within Paris, everywhere"
"But in this case,"
Brenda grabbed a little more than she could handle.
Get off of me!
"Bitch, you better move!"
[Grunts]
[Screams]
Somebody call an ambulance!
"Our loser in this fight inadvertently fell and impaled herself on the sharp, ornament hood of a car, piercing deep into her abdomen or stomach, causing massive bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock, causing her to become unconscious, instantaneously,"
and then resulting in immediate death.
What the hell?
Brenda thought she was the toughest girl in the hood.
Then she landed on the hood.
[Grunts]
And realized she didn't have a lot of guts after all.
Strap him.
No!
"It's 1954, and Charles, a convicted murderer, is about to get introduced to a popular psychiatric treatment of the times."
I will kill you!
I'm gonna kill you all!
"Electro-convulsive therapy, otherwise known as shock treatment."
Administering first dose.
[Yells]
Electro-shock therapy is a treatment for people who have states of psychosis that are severe and untreatable in other ways.
"First used in the 1930s to induce seizures, believing that it will set the brain right, reboot the brain."
"One of the greatest controversies surrounding electro-shock therapy is people have claimed to have lost years of memory from their lives, which is usually recoverable, to some extent."
[Gurgles]
"Charles was a resilient psychopath, and he was playing possum."
Charles?
Charles?
Waiting for the right moment...
To escape.
[Gasps]
"Because he used to drink heavily, liver failure has caused the death"
Oh God!
He doesn't drink because of that he didn't auction any wine shop
Some mistake has happened
"Hey, who is the doctor who made that report?"
Bring him
Where is your chief doctor?
"But for you,I would have been tormented by litigation"
- My life would have been spoiled
- Someone will help good people
"I might be one among them, that is all"
Come
Ruling party men came searching for you here
Now they might be on their way to your home
- Be alert doctor
- OK
Immediately lodge a complaint with police that Sethupathy's men..
..have damaged your property and has made an attempt on your life
I will deal with the rest Come
Bring stones and sticks
Break everything
Arul what is all this?
"Oh God, dear"
What is all this?
It is all broken
"Commissioner, what does that inspector think about himself?"
"Knowing pretty well, they are my men He has arrested them"
"Ask him to release them immediately fir is filed, public has also seen"
He is not an ordinary man and is equivalent to a sub collector in rank
"He is the Government hospital dean This government is mine, don't you know?"
I will produce him in court tomorrow and bail him out
"Please don't interfere in that doctor's matter, it'll become a big issue"
"In the meantime, outbreaks of drug-resistant diseases"
Have been increasing with insane speed.
The cdc estimates that over two million americans
"Get antibacterial resistant infections every year,"
"Killing a total of 23,000."
"David I'heureux contracted one of these superbugs,"
An extremely drug-resistant strain of an intestinal bacteria
Called clostridium difficile.
"He survived the initial infection, though not all of him."
David:
"So now I wear this bag here,"
"Which you will see through the day that, all of a sudden,"
You'll start seeing a lump here.
Okay.
And then you'll know that I'm starting to fill up.
Morton:
That pouch is called an ileostomy bag.
"David's stomach empties directly into it, because he no longer has an intestine."
"David, who, by the way, was a paramedic,"
Contracted his bacterial infection while consulting at a hospital in china.
"When he got back to the states with severe diarrhea,"
"His doctor put him on an iv of cipro,"
A powerful broad-spectrum antibiotic.
Instead of fighting the c.
"Diff, however, due to its resistance,"
"The cipro effectively cleared out the rest of the bacteria living in his gi tract,"
"Including the good, healthy kind, thereby allowing the c."
Diff
To go from infecting part of his intestine to colonizing the whole thing.
"That night, I started having some abdominal pain."
"The next day, the abdominal pain was getting a lot worse."
My fever was increasing.
This is all because of Sethupathy
You only have the courage and boldness to oppose them
You can bring light to us
Yes I will take care
Give water
Are you not ashamed to say nothing can be done
At the opportune time set fire to the Jeeva nagar huts
If you do like this no one will vote for us
We can cast those votes
All of you come quick
They have set fire to huts
Save my child
My house is on fire save my child
Fortunately she came out and saw him
Otherwise entire huts would have been burnt
That people's party men has set ablaze
He has killed my child
Party leader Sethupathy is coming to console
"Stop there, if you step forward I will cut off your legs"
You have killed the child Have you come now to console?
"After setting fire, have you come to console?"
"Just because they support me, you have burnt their house"
"If all of them unite, do you know what will happen?"
Did I set fire?
what basis you say this?
"There is an eyewitness, to the incident"
They have seen your man setting fire
You have named your party as People's Party
What have you done for the people?
Because you are in power and in office you are behaving like this
You have killed my child You will be doomed
Have you seen this child?
I should've tried more things out
Try a lot of things to find a craft for myself
But I was scared of trying
Failing in this world that I loved
But I seriously regret it now
I don't even know what it's like to challenge new things
"Compared to now, the stuff I was worried about in my youth was nothing"
My worries are much bigger now
It was like a grain of sand
It was just a moment of anguish
You guys shouldn't be worrying now
Yes
Leave worrying up to us old men
It's our job
It's not something you guys should feel
"No, you aren't supposed to feel it."
You should trust your possibilities
I am done with it.
Completely pinned down by work to survive
"By survive you mean brothels, right?"
Well honestly I haven't gone for a while
"No, for anime and games"
Still not something to be proud of
"But you are still young, compared to guys in their 60s or 80s"
Especially your body
You've still got potential
You think so?
Especially compared to those guys who can't see reality straight on
"""I'm just taking it easy"""
"Compared to those guys, you are working really hard"
Maybe I should at least have graduated Otaku-dom
"But if you weren't an Otaku, you and I wouldn't have met"
So close down all private schools and students will go to Govt school?
I didn't say that
Education is not a profession
It is a service
Care and concern shown towards a student
I pity all parents
If their kids study in a school that levies a fat fee they will get an elevated status in our society is their blind belief!
So schools take advantage and charge an arm and a leg
They compete at every level
"In sticking posters, building construction, fees collection, ISO endorsement"
Competition and rivalry in every sphere and level
Shame on them!
Even in adding a teacher to their school they compete
Not being blessed enough to take a bus to school there are still students who walk miles to schools in our country
Isn't this a fact?
There are still students who depend on the Govt's noon meal scheme in school
Wearing the uniform the Govt gives them there are students who celebrate festivals
Haven't they excelled?
Made a name for themselves
What's wrong with these students then?
I wish to say this here
Don't sell knowledge
Please don't barter education
"Tell me, Maya"
I'm held up in a very important research work
"Female research, huh?"
What a surprise?
!
Come and join us
She's just a friend
"I waste your time, huh!"
Why did you suddenly show up here?
That monsanto is pushing around.
They've amassed an incredible amount of influence in the us.
"We met with senator jon teste, a farmer from montana."
Tester removed language that had been inserted
Into a u.S. Spending bill
That would have protected monsanto seeds
From legal action.
Not only does this ignore the constitution idea
"Of separation of powers,"
But it also lets genetically modified crops
"Take hold across this country,"
Even when a judge finds it violates the law.
There was evidently somebody that put that language in.
"Now, nobody took credit for it."
I'm assuming that they put it in at monsanto's behest.
Do you think it's the case that the u.S. Government
Has been helping the biotech industry?
I think there are people within the senate
And within the house that absolutely do that.
"This is a different way of doing business for agriculture,"
And I always get really nervous when farmers have always had control of their seed
"From the beginning of time, and the seed will have to be bought every year"
By the farmers from an agribusiness company.
"So I think, as we move forward, we need to do it cautiously,"
And we need to know what we're getting into.
Yeung:
"Shortly after this interview was shot,"
The world health organization
"Declared glyphosate,"
The key chemical sprayed
"On these crops,"
A probable carcinogen
"No, Captain, I can't say I'm surprised at any of it:"
And what you're telling me about my ship disappearing: : :
Is nothing compared to some of the strange things I saw on that blasted planet:
What sort of things?
"- Well, ghosts for one thing:"
- Ghosts?
That's the only thing I can think of to call them:
"Unless you want to say ""visions:"""
"But that seems like splitting hairs, if you ask me:"
Things would...
Things would appear and disappear:
Even the sun seemed to come up from a different direction each morning:
I tell you:
The planet is cursed:
"And if you ask me, that's what's causing the strange behavior you've been seeing here in your ship:"
Are you suggesting that that planet exerts a supernatural force: : :
That causes people to see things and to behave strangely?
"Colonel, I don't know if you'd call it supernatural or not:"
"But a force, there is:"
That much I'll swear to:
I think we better go talk to Dr:
Goodfellow:
It all seems to be working all right:
That we know is off:
Let's have a look here:
Dr:
Goodfellow:
Yeah?
"Oh, it's you, Buck:"
"Yes, nice to see you and Colonel Deering:"
"You're looking awfully busy, Doctor:"
I'm conducting tests in an effort to account for some of the extraordinary behavior: : :
Anyone who has my job has to know every little thing
- Rabab robbed me
- You asked for it
You cheated
"Pasha, you tricked me and the owner of the bar... and the customers"
"This place is respectable, we only offer drinks... nothing else, we are respectable people that's why I fired Rabab and you're fired, too and don't even let me see you pass in front of the bar"
"Do you want to leave on your feet or on a stretcher, lover boy?"
Get up before I beat you up in front of the bar trash
How did I miss that?
How did I miss that you're a pimp?
- Good evening
- Good evening
- Where's Hoda Sha'rawy street?
- I don't know
Are you a stranger here?
"No, but sometimes a person gets disoriented"
I don't know anything about all these streets we stand where they tell us to
You mean you stay standing all night?
- It's our destiny
- You can't sit?
"Oh God, if they catch me sitting or sleeping, I'll get punished"
- But you can walk around
- In the area of my watch
You look like an excellent young man
"Thank you, sir"
Walk with me for a few meters
"- I told you, sir..."
- Come on
- Here
"- No, I can't we're not allowed to take anything from anyone"
- What's your name?
"- Abd Rabbu Abdelbary, sir"
- thanks
- ENJOY!
no

I think it's good right?

"Wakabe Yuzo, the anime creator"
a sudden glow
"I feel, and still the flames increasing rise;"
Yet less I heed my own than other's woe:
My ill but festers and increases the more
Medoro's wounds are seen to heal and close:
"And thou growest lusty, while I suffer sore,"
"Feel, with new fever parched, now burnt, now froze:"
"Unseasonable flake, which melts away"
"Exposed, in sunny place, to scorching ray."
"I beg thee, haply an unwitting foe,"
To sheathe the suffering of that cruel blow.
"To pluck, as yet untouched, the virgin rose,"
"Now I do permit to thee, young Medore."
"Let's holy ceremonies interpose,"
"Some deal to veil, to gild the matter o'er."
"Young Love be bridesman here the tie to bless,"
And for brideswoman stand the shepherdess.
"Amid such pleasures, where, with tree o'ergrown,"
"Runs stream, or bubbling fountain's wave doth spin,"
"On bark or rock, if yielding be the stone,"
The knife is straight at work or ready pin.
"And there, without, in thousand places lone,"
"MEDORO and ANGELICA are traced,"
In divers cyphers quaintly interlaced.
Where often in the hottest noon of day
"We two have rested, locked in fond embrace."
"Within the grotto, and without it, they"
Will see more than in any other place
"With charcoal or with chalk our names portrayed,"
Or flourished with the knife's indenting blade.
END OF THE THIRD PART
Subtitles adapted from the translation of William Stewart Rose
Make money in your sleep
"That's right, dearie Show him what you've got"
"That's right, dearie Let him have the lot"
PROSTITUTES:
"Old men, young men Take 'em as they come!"
Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum
"Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land"
See them with their trousers off They're never quite as grand!
All it takes is money in your hand
Lovely ladies Going for a song
Got a lot of callers But they never stay for long
"Come on, Captain You can wear your shoes"
Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse?
Easy money Lying on a bed
Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head
Don't they know they're making love to one already dead?
(MAN EXHALES)
(COINS CLINKING)
There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
I eavesdropped Naughty guy
You have married me twice Do you know?
-How?
-One is an yellow thread
And the other one a white thread
Do you still keep it with you?
So far nothing good has happened in our constituency
"After his death, now it is a good time for us"
"People need not get loans for exorbitant interest and forego their property against the loan,hereafter"
We should follow whatever Arul says
If Arul is contesting against Sethupathy
It is good for Jeeva nagar people
If Arul has a problem All of us should join together
You should have weeded him out when he was a plant
Now he has grown like a tree and is opposing you
Ukkadam and Jeeva nagar people support him
Show him what will happen
If he opposes one in office
"Stop electricity, water, ration  everything"
Let them not have water for bathing drinking and even in toilets Let it stink
"He thinks, this will solve the problem"
What is this?
"whether is night or daytime, there is no power"
"EB people say, if you oppose ruling party men"
You will have to bear the consequences
"Water has stopped, what to do?"
"Grandma, is there no water here also?"
No water at all
Sit down
What is the matter?
There is no water and electricity in our area
And we are suffering a lot
I want to live honorably in this street
"See, even after all this, he is quiet and rock like"
Come on good sardine is available
"We are vegetarians, we don't eat fish and meat"
Don't mistake me
I have seen children who don't respect parents
Even when his dad admonished him like anything
Your son kept quite Only your son can behave that way
Your son is like a diamond
It can be used as a cutting tool and also as a decoration
Please ask him not to scold Arul in public
It occurred to me...
"I keep telling, don't you have brain at all?"
Don't talk too much I will tear you apart
I have got four brothers They won't leave you easily
Did you brush your teeth this morning?
Why?
Why do you start so early?
...
Are my four brothers there as pallbearers?
Was I not pampered as the only girl child?
He has smacked very badly
What can I do now?
You prepare wedding chain in gold for all
Did you prepare my wedding chain in clay?
I shuttle between Tiruppur and Kovai and don't know when it will snap?
Won't someone pay and send the auto?
"See, your sister"
"Mom, Even here she talks like this"
Who knows how badly she talked there?
"Alright, you take her there"
Your brother-in-law won't listen to others
"A common debt enjoins you mutual aid,"
Militant here upon one Church's side.
I range my troops anew:
some warriors went
To strengthen feeble posts which succours claim;
"The rest against the Saracens are sent,"
To give the foe checkmate and end the game.
"When now across the stream, without the wall,"
"I turn, and see the royal town appear,"
"To have traversed all the city moves my ire,"
Leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire;
"Rodomont, listen to me, Rodomont!"
"Know that I am the courier of thy dame,"
"I all my rage extinguish, clear my front,"
And feel my courage brighten into flame.
"O dwarf, to my inquiry answer now:"
How fares our lady?
Wither sent art thou?
"Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,"
Who is another's thrall and by his side.
"We, on our road, encountered yesterday"
"A knight, who seized and bore away the bride."
"As tiger rages, who in vain descends"
"Into her den, and finds herself alone,"
"And, circling all the cavern, comprehends,"
"At last, that her beloved young are gone;"
"To ire, to rage like hers my wrath extends:"
"Nor night I now regard, nor rock, nor stone,"
"Nor stream, nor length of way nor storm suppress"
The speed with which I on the plunderer press.
"So raging for the news that the dwarf bore,"
"I hurry with such speed, that not with more"
on purpose you said you're not going?
First passed
Second starts at 10:00
Ishida too bad don't mind try again next year be more cheerful you were just unlucky
Ishida
10 copies let's start again from here let's work hard
yes
I'll work hard too
Ishida sorry take care of this - yea
Fujii needs to work hard are you ok Fujii?
I'm fine why don't you leave it to Imaoka-san this time?
i'm fine I'll finish it up you're just locking yourself up working too hard during times like this want me to help?
"I can do it myself, don't worry"
but you're mad
I'm fine
I can do it myself
what do you want to say?
if there isn't anything I'm going
nothing has changed
Fujii-san ever since I first met her
she's always busy and always working hard
but she has something that holds off others and now too
Fujii-san is trying to do everything herself working too hard
staying like this she'll probably worry about me for not succeding and carrying things by herself
I want to be with her but staying like this
I'll make her be more lonely
so I'm not good for her
then
I need to send her off smiling
I can't show off
hey
Ogiwara-san
"Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams."
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together with lines that represents those movies.
"So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,"
"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not."
"Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together called ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America""--it was not a very popular movie."
"Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""The Terminal."""
"Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in ""The Sixth Sense."" They were the stars of that movie."
"I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment was also in ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks."
"Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Deconstructing Harry."""
"Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Gambit""."
"Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in ""Death to Smoochy."" All right!"
"Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito, who were in a movie together called ""I'm Still Here."""
"And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, who were in a movie called ""Billy Bathgate."""
All right!
"Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors."
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.
So there's lot of different choices to start off.
"Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,"
"Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again, to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment, and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks."
All right!
So let's try this again with a different set of actors.
"Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,"
"Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep."
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.
"Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called ""Wag the Dog."""
"Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called ""Marvin's Room."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called ""Moonlight Mile."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Hook."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""Sleepers."""
"Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Stepmom."""
"Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in ""Flatliners."""
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.

"995 01:22:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:22:44,900 I am sure your family feels like that too."
"996 01:22:45,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:52,200 If they knew the truth they would have a big disappointment."
I am sure.
"997 01:22:52,269 --&amp;gt; 01:22:55,430 But as Yaman prefers to keep quiet about this issue... 998 01:22:55,700 --&amp;gt; 01:23:00,500 I will respect his decision too."

THE MlSSlNG PlECE
Baby basket
Today we're going to make a gift basket for a baby.
"We're going to make it look original, elegant and with an artisan touch."
I've used a basket which you can find in any shopping centre or home interiors store.
"I've chosen the wicker one but it could also be white, or whatever colour you want, or which matches best."
To decorate it I've used a few bows made from quilted fabric.
"I have made the rest of the material for the basket with this quilted fabric, but if you go to the shops and you've chosen a blanket or some fabric which you like, try and get it all to match, so if you buy a few satin bows then you can decorate it using the same colours."
"In my case, because I have got it made to measure, they've made me these bows which look great."
"For the base, since I want the things to show at the top and not end up with everything sitting in the bottom and not looking pretty, we can put a base of tissue paper, which is the paper which we use for patterns or for children's handicraft, and I'm going to scrunch it up to make a base."
This tissue paper is very lightweight so we have to scrunch it up.
Now I've got the base on which to arrange all the items.
"I've bought a blanket, a towel, a bib a coat hanger which we have personalised, and a teddy bear which matches the other items."
Since it's a personal gift and I wanted something more artisanal
"I've made a personalised picture on a piece of cloth, in a thick frame, which looks very good, and I've decorated the edge with the same pattern as the rest of the drawing."
"I'm going to put the picture here, and then I'll put in the blanket, the hanger, the towel, and the bear on this side."
"To finish the wrapping you can buy some celophane like this, wrap it all up towards the top, and put on a big bow to finish it."
So that's the baby's gift basket.
I hope that you like it and that you have fun making it.
Until next time!
"vừa thời điểm bắt đầu chỉ có bóng tối và sau đó, bang tạo ra sự mở rộng không giới hạn của mọi hiện tượng như thời gian, không gian hãy nhìn xa hơn những gì chúng ta có thể tưởng tượng vượt qua cả sự tồn tại của chúng ta ở nơi mà chúng ta gọi là vũ trụ có thể có 1 thế giới khác ngoài kia"
"Now, if you remember that problem, and even just to do that problem, when we thought about this statement, such that the trace of A is not divisible by p, we figured out that this was exactly equal to saying that A does not equal 0."
"So one way to view the result of problem 43 is if you assume that A is not equal to 0, there are p minus 1 squared members of T sub p where the determinant is divisible by p."
So we're starting to count some of the A's whose determinant is divisible by p.
But these are the only-- the matrix A's whose a entry is not equal to 0.
"So if we want to count all of them, we have to also count the ones where a does equal 0, so where a does equal 0."
So let's think about that case.
"We can figure out how many matrices there are where a does equal 0, and the determinant of A is divisible by p."
Add it to that.
Then we have the total number of A's whose determinants are divisible by p.
"And we could subtract that from the total number of possibilities, and hopefully, we'll get one of the answers up here."
So let's think a little bit about what will the determinant look like over here?
"So in this situation, the determinant of our matrix will be-- it's a squared."
"It's a times a minus b times c, a squared minus bc."
"Now, we're assuming that a is equal to 0."
"If a is equal to 0, it's equal to negative bc."
"And we need to think about how is this going to be a multiple, or how is this going to be divisible by p?"
So this has got to be equal to some multiple of p.
"So the first thing, just think about b's and the c's."
They are both non-negative.
So this value right here cannot be negative.
"So if you put a negative sign there, it cannot be positive."
So it can't be any positive multiples of p.
It could be 0.
So we could have negative bc.
"We could have negative bc is equal to 0, which is equivalent to saying that bc is equal to 0."
"That's one possibility, where it equals 0 times p."
That's still a multiple.
Or maybe it could be negative.
Maybe we could have negative bc is equal to negative 1 times p.
"But when you think about it here, if this was true, that would mean that bc is equal to p, so b or c would be factors of p."
"Now, we know that p is a prime number."
"Its factors are only 1 and p. b and c-- I mean, one of these guys could be 1, but then the other guy would have to be p."
"We was at the Leoncito, working for my dad, and then we started riding horses, probably when I was 5 or 6 years old -- getting on some horses by ourselves, and my brother and I would go to the corral and rope the milk cow's calves and ride them."
Put the rope on and ride them.
We wanted to be cowboys.
The skills Charlie was acquiring to manage cattle and horses would later help him to compete in rodeos.
"When we were marking lambs, he used to tell us"
"leave 10 or 12 lambs outside, and talk about fun"
"I had for Welsh horses, and they were good."
"They'd just follow a lamb like a dog, you know."
"And we had those little maguey ropes and we used to rope them, and put one lamb in front of your saddle and rope another one, and then get two and take them to the corral and then go rope some more."
Rodeo is a Spanish word that referred to the semi-annual roundup of cattle borne from the Mexican ranching tradition.
I must have been 16-17 the first time I went on the roundup.
When they started the roundup they would call to see who was going to go.
They would come to town and ask you if you wanted to go to the roundup for 40-45 days.
"If you said yes, they would tell you what day they would pick you up."
"So you had to roll your bat, and have it ready."
"And your saddle, and they would come in the truck and pick you up."
"By the time we got gathered and getting close to where the camp was going to be the cook had lunch for us, coffee."
We changed horses to start sorting.
You always kept the best horses to sort cattle because you always used the best horses for the cutting.
You ride the broncs in the morning.
My uncle says that on the 06 ranch you could ride on horseback from dawn to dusk and never see a fence.
He started working in the first grade to help support the family and had dreams of buying the perfect horse to take him to the main event.
He learned quickly that if he didn't have a good horse there was no use in showing up.
They had this rodeo in Fort Davis.
There were college boys and I'm working on ranches.
We used to rope a lot of baby calves.
"I had the rope in my hand and this guy who used to go to Sul Ross, he says what are you going to do with that rope, Charlie?"
So I told him...I says
I'm going to beat you guys in the calf roping tomorrow.
This other guy had a nice calf horse and I used him.
So I went out there and roped this brahma calf and I went out there and flanked him and tied him.
And won the calf roping... with that raggedy rope.
"And maybe eh, the star goes first so he sets the balance to 100, 500 minus 400."
"And then the buffalo sets the balance to negative 200, 100 minus 300."
And you know what we just did?
We just robbed the bank.
[LAUGH]
And then they both report true and you've got 200 dollars ahead.
"And that's not to good Actually BYOB will try to stop most of these, and this case it does."
There's no raised condition here because
"BYOB fixes it but this code does create race case, Race Condition."
There're two more problems of concurency problems that we want to talk about.
The first one is a deadlock.
The two people or multiple threads or multiple cores are trying to grab the same information but they won't give up the information that the other needs.
"So in this case, eh, two people are, need to draw a graph and one grabs the pencil, the other grabs the paper and the guy with the pencil wont let go of his pencil until he gets the paper and draws his graph."
And the guy with the paper wont let go of the paper until he gets the pencil.
"And they're just stuck there, always waiting, and that's not to good."
There's also this image of these cars that none of them can move forward because there's a car in front of them.
"I think if this guy got out it would slowly get fixed, but it's a bit hard."
[LAUGH].
"Similarly, there's a livelock."
"When, deadlocks are very common and eh,"
"You say, okay if you've got the pencil or the paper and you can't get the other one maybe you can put yours down for a minute and come back, and that's a good way to solve it right?"
"But what happens if both people, one grabs the pencil, one grabs the paper and tries to grab the other one but they can't."
"So they both put it down at the same time, they both go away for a minute, they both come back, grab the same one and they can't get the other one again."
"So they put it down, go away, they come back and they still can't do it."
And that's a livelock.
"You're trying to get rid of it and, but because your algorithm eh, keeps matching itself, it actually doesn't work."
"The other very common example eh, that we love, and I'll let Dan and Luke show it to you guys when they do, is that if two people are trying to pass each other in a hallway sometimes you both lean in the same way and then the other, but livelock is that you infinitely do this."
That you just can't get out.
You're stuck in the hallway all night.
What to do?
Cool.
"So in summary this move to parallelism is a big sea"" change""."
This institute is made for special needs people
They teach them Quran and the Deen.
we are now in chechnya in one of the ultimate Quran institute
This institute was built in 1904 - very old institute but it was renovated recently [in the past few years]
The strange thing about this institute is that there's 100 student- from them are normal students who memorize theQuran and from them [around 25 students] are special needs
"Those who are deaf, unable to speak and unable to see. and from one of the beautiful examples in this institute is a young man who's Russian"
"He converted to Islam, and he has this great keenness in wanting to learn the Quran, Keep in mind he's blind yet he wants to learn the Quran, ofcourse through braille and wants to memorize it as well."
MashaAllah i heard that he learned how to read braille in a small period of time and learned how to read the Quran very well.. how long did it take him to learn it?
"To be honest, to learn the correct way so that you can prefect the reading.. it takes a long period of time"
But i learned the basic of braille [connecting the letters and words together] in 2 days.
"This is due to that fact that I already knew how to read braille in Russian language and English, so I didnt find difficulty in learning the Arabic one."
Okay but why do care so much about leanring
Why does he want to learn this fast and is trying to seek nearness to Allah?
I have always had a desire to learn the Language of the Quran so that I can read it
This is why I left university of Moscow and came here.
I Ask Allah to ease my way in seeking this knowledge for his sake.
Does he enjoy it?
"- Ofcourse, with no doubt."
- This is concidered his Jannah on Earth
- He has found the Jannah of This dunyah by learning this language for the sake of learning the Speech of Allah.
"Allahu Akbar, this is beautiful!"
"- As you've heard, he left his studies and family to come and learn the Quran"
I asked him do you enjoy what you do? he said:
"Indeed I found the Heaven of This Dunyah by Learning the Quran. by Allah, this is a beautiful answer."
I heard that this young man is a soccer player in the National Team of Russia?
Yes I do play soccer with the National team of Russia that's made especially for blind people and we won the European cup just recently in Portugal
"So not only is he focusing on learning how to read braille in arabic, but he's also working on Quran memorization and he still active in other ways, the likes of his favorite sports and such"
He has many goals mashaAllah.
But our request is for him to Read to us
Surat An'baa:
"""About what are they asking one another?"
About the great news..That over which they are in disagreement
The limit as delta t approaches 0 of r of s t plus delta t minus r of s and t.
"In this situation we're holding the s, you can imagine, in constant."
"We're finding its change in t, all of that over delta t."
And the same thing falls out.
"This is equal to the partial of x with respect to ti plus y with respect to tj, plus z with respect to tk."
"Same exact thing, you just kind of swap the s's and the t's."
"And by that same logic, you'd have the same result but in terms of t."
"If you do this pseudo mathy thing that I did up here, then you would get the partial of r with respect to t times a super small change in t. dt, our t differential, you could imagine, is equal to r of st plus dt minus r of s and t."
So let's box these two guys away.
"And in the next video, we're going to actually visualize what these mean."
"And sometimes, when you kind of do a bunch of like, silly math"
"like this, you're always like, all right, what is this all about?"
"Remember, all I did is I said, what does it mean to take the derivative of this with respect to s or t?"
"Played around with it a little bit, I got this result."
"These 2 are going to be very valuable for us, I think, in getting the intuition for why surface integrals"
look the way they do.
"So in problem 44, once again we have the exact same setup that we had in problems 42 and 43."
But now they're asking us the number of A in T sub p such that the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"Well, we've already done some work in problem 43 in figuring out some set of the members that are divisible by p."
"So why don't we just figure out the total number of members of T sub p, and then subtract the total members whose determinants are divisible by p, and then we'll get this answer right over here."
So what's the total members in T sub p?
"Well, for a, I have p possible choices, right?"
"If I'm picking between-- up to p minus 1, but I'm including 0, there's actually p possible choices."
"So I have p possible choices for a, p possible choices for b by the same logic, and p possible choices for c."
So I have p to the third possibilities.
So there are a total of p to the third members in T sub p.
"Now, what did the last problem tell us?"
This was number 43.
It told us the members-- maybe I should write it this way.
"The number of members, numbers of A's, such that the trace of A-- this was the language I used in the last video or the last problem-- such that the trace of A not divisible by p, but the determinant of A is."
And we got the answer as p minus 1 squared.
Sub-string search.
So first thing is how to compute the hash function.
"So we take the, just convert the Math."
So R's our Radix.
"So in this example, we're using ten so we have decimal numbers."
"And then the digits, say t's of i That's the text characters."
"So we have a number x of I, which is the,"
"M characters starting at position I. And that's just in Math, ti*R to the M-1"
"So you know, in this case that's two10000+61000+5100+310+5 that's just"
Math for that.
And our goal is so it's an N digit base based our integer modular Q And our and our goal is to do the math.
That gives us the remainder that we would get when dividing that by Q well there's really easy method called Horner's Method that we can use to evaluate a degree in polynomials just with a multiplied M multiply and add.
"And we can do the modular computation all the way through at each step, to keep the numbers less than q and we still get the same result."
"And so the idea is, you multiply by R."
"You go from left to right through the digits and you just multiply by R and add the digit, and then do mod q at every time."
So we start with two mod 97 is two.
To six mod 987 is two*10+6 mod 987 and that's 26.
And then I take that value.
Multiply by ten and add five that's 265 mod 997.
"In that case it's, it's 265."
So 265*10+3 is 2653.
"Our remainder is divided by 997, it's 659, so even though our number gets bigger than 997, might take them out every time, we keep our running total less than 997."
And then the last step is to take the 659.
Basically we've thrown out a bunch of multiples of 997 that we don't care about.
And 659*10+5 mod 997 is exactly equal to 26535 mod 997 and that's 613.
That's our value.
"So that's A using Horner's method we got a, well known linear time method to do compute or hash function with this simple code."
"And this notice will work even for a huge key that we wouldn't compute a hundred dig, convert a hundred digit key in to some number to do the calculation."
We do one digit at a time using Horner's method and then we have no limit because we're always keeping our numbers less than our prime queue.
"So that's a first step, so no matter how big the pattern is,"
"We can efficiently compute a hash or, since that is the first step."
So now the second step for the Rabin Karp algorithm is to realize that if we know xi mod q we can efficiently compute xi+1 mod q cause they have a lot of digits in common.
"All I was doing was paying off the interest on the debt I had, which was £30,000."
"I was basically rocking around the clock, really."
My standard of living wasn't good at all.
I didn't go out and the amount of money that I had for food was £40 for the month.
I came to a time when I thought enough was enough and at the time I was working in a hospital.
I started going to the chapel there and that's where I then found a book called 'Word for Today'.
I read that book and at the back of it it had a salvation prayer.
I read that salvation prayer and I gave my life to God.
I put my heart and soul in a letter and I sent it off to the address that was at the back of that book.
I got a phone call from somebody called Pastor Sheila.
She invited me to the church and she counselled me and I told her about my debt problems and she gave me some information for Christians Against Poverty.
"At that stage I was so relieved because of the fact that I knew then that I would get support, and the burden just lifted."
"Any letters, any correspondance that I had with my creditors,"
"I just directed them to Christians Against Poverty, which was a relief, basically; it just took away the stress."
"As a consequence to becoming a CAP client, I also now support people who are also in debt."
"I've learned how to budget, my standard of living has improved because I'm able to go out and socialise, which I couldn't do before."
The fellowship with the people at church is crucial as well because they also offered support.
"When you are going through debt you sort of withdraw and you don't socialise because of the lack of money, but once the stress has been taken away you're able to talk about it and testify about how good God is and how stressless you are."
"The home stretch, we're on problem 18."
And this diagram actually looks like something that this little tool I'm using is well-suited to draw.
"Let me try-- I'll draw the one in the back first, so I can do different colors and everything."
"So I'll do the one in the back in yellow, and it looks something like this."
"Goes like this, then it switches over like that."
"And then I'll draw the next one, this orange color, and it looks something-- no, I'll do it in a more drastic color."
So it does something like this.
"It goes like this, crosses over, dips down, then it goes over again."
"And then finally, this last one, and it looks something like this."
"Crosses over and it goes like that, very pretty."
Now let me switch to a smaller-- OK.
"Why don't we do white, I never write in white."
In the figure above--so they say this is the start.
And this is step 1.
And I'm just going to begin to pass the tube in.
"And I just want to keep passing it down and the patient will swallow, until I get to that mark that told me I was in all the way."
All right.
"Once we've gotten so that we've passed the tube as far as we want to, we've gotten to the mark that we wanted to get to, and we can secure the tube in the patient's nose."
"And there's a couple of ways you can do that, but we'll use kids tape here."
Make a little flag.
Secure that in the patient's nose.
And then I need to check for placement.
"I'm going to add this Lopez value here, at the end."
"It's a stopcock that is designed to go onto, for tube feedings and for naso-gastric tubes."
"So I'll put this on the end of the Levin tube and then I need to, there's a couple ways that I can check that this tube is in the right place."
"I can have this patient x-rayed, to make sure the tube is in the proper place."
I can withdraw some of the gastric contents and check for pH.
Those two are considered the best gold standards.
The x-ray placement and then the pH.
"PH should indicate that it's very acidic, being in the stomach."
The third mechanism of placement is to add some air in here and to listen with a stethoscope to see if you hear a whoosh.
So you can listen here.
That's the third mechanism.
"It's not as accurate, but it is used a lot in many institutions if they don't have the bedside testing."
"So know what your unit protocol is, what your hospital protocol is."
"So this would be the third one, and I would be listening with a stethoscope here and listening to hear a whoosh from the air."
"Once I know, once I have confirmed placement by either pH, x-ray or air sounds, then I'm going to turn the Lopez valve so that I shut off here to the patient so that it doesn't drip out and then until I'm ready for my feeding."
"Now, depending on which type of feeding it is, it can set up a little different."
"If the patient is going to have an intermittent feeding, every so many hours they get so many cc's of fluid, and you administer it all together, I'm going to need an irrigation tray."
"And this, because this tray has a bulb type syringe, I'm actually going to use a catheter tip syringe also."
So I would have gotten that extra.
And then I have my tube feeding that I'm going to use.
Tube feeding.
Okay.
Okay.
"So I'm going to pour my tube feeding in here, whatever the prescribed amount is."
That's been mainly the kind of things that I've been able to see since having children.
"I love to go to carnival, because I'm really involved in that"
I love going to the pictures and I like to go and watch plays
"I have two grandsons and my daughter makes us go everywhere we go to the farm, we go everywhere that's cheap to the Science Museum, wherever we can get in for free."
"Because, she sits down and searches the internet like anthing to find events that are going on in London for free."
"As long as I can be entertained, I'm not really fussed."
I don't go to the pictures as much but I do prefer to watch a play especially young people that are not famous
"I like to go and watch things that I know other people's children are going to be in it, just to see how it is."
"I love sports, so anything to do with sports is for me so I spend most of my time trying to find out where the next football action is on or who is doing what in the parks, in cycling and so on."
"Hackney's great, in the summer time there's no borough in London I believe that can beat them"
"They have old fairs, book fairs, craft fairs, charity do's they're very organic, they have recycling stuff and so on."
"I'm looking forward to Spring, Summer coming on."
"That is one of the main things, free events,"
I went to the Science Museum the other day
I'm going to back through and try and look back at the stuff I went to.
"I did go out of Hackney recently to the fun fairs the old fashioned kind of Gerry Cottle circus, so that's what I've done with the little guy."
SARAH LEE:
"Our next speaker now, which is Jim Tucker."
"Jim is Head of Journalism down at Whitireia Journalism School, down in Wellington, and I had the pleasure of catching up with Jim"
"last week, and being shown around, and it's a very impressive, modern campus."
"So yes, without further ado, welcome, Jim."
[applause]
JlM TUCKER:
"Thanks very much, Sarah."
I've had to put the pencil through some of what I've written after hearing some of the things that Jane has said.
"For instance, I had this very well-founded theory that if you could reenact a suicide on a soap opera on television that that would have much more potential for harm than, my words here are, the second- and third-hand accounts of officials and those known to a suicide victim."
"But she's just proven that wrong, so that's been excised."
"Tēnā koe, George."
Thank you for your welcome.
I now acknowledge some of my colleagues from the media:
"John Roughan from the Herald down here,"
"Jonathan Marshall from Sunday News,"
How we experienced it.
"The first international perception of the 15M was on the 18th or 19th, I can't remember the dates when we got a message from Egypt through a co-worker at Periodismo Humano, Olga Rodríguez."
It was from the revolutionary commission of Egypt- that's not the right name but you understand- supporting what was happening in Sol.
I remember talking to Olga about publishing it but we had to talk to the people in the Puerta del Sol first.
So they knew they had support.
ST:
"There was a problem with one of the words in that, wasn't there?"
JL:
"Yes, in the message we got from Egypt supporting the 15M, in the headline they wrote of their support to Democracia Real Ya."
"So of course, they were already talking about whether Democracia Real Ya was part of the camp, who was who... it was all very sensitive."
And I remember asking Olga if she knew who was who.
"So we explained it to them and they said OK, let's make it as broad as possible, and they changed the message and made it extensive to all the 15M."
"We didn't consider ourselves the writers of the message, we simply asked what they meant and we advised them a little about what it was all about."
"It was all so incipient, there were so many debates, it was logical that something like that should happen."
That was the first international perception we had.
"Parallel to that, you spend 12 or 15 hours in a doorway telling stories, trying to find the humane side to things, working on reports..."
"In all, doing high quality journalism and suddenly you go up to a roof on the 17th, and the man there wants to charge you for taking a photo from the balcony and you give it little importance saying it's just a mobile, and you go to the balcony and make a 40 second video."
"You publish it on the internet, because there's 3G coverage up there, and after you put it on youtube it becomes the most seen video of the month in the political news category."
And in a few hours you have hundred of thousands of reproductions.
And suddenly they tell me that the video's on the website of the New York Times.
And then in the Washington Post.
"And on BoingBoing, one of the most read blogs in English in the world."
And then more media.
And front pages... it's something...
"We were the first source of information on the 15M for the New York Times and the Washington Post, the first text they produced was a photo of mine of a woman with a non-violence sign, and the panoramic video taken from the balcony with Paz Vega in the background."
"Paz Vega, the involuntary muse of the 15M."
ST:
We shamelessly took advantage of her.
JL:
"That was the second great reaction we noticed, or that I noticed personally."
"From there on, there were radios from France, from Chile, Argentina, Miami..."
Articles in Al Jazeera.
"So we've chosen the things that sort of solved the most complexity like being able to send an SMS with one click, being able to navigate some of it with one click."
"There's one that I didn't demonstrate, which I use, like, ten times a day, which is to say, ""Note to self,"" and then, you know, ""Buy milk on the way home,"" or whatever reminder you want to send yourself."
"I'm sure many of you geeks here send yourself emails all the time, trying a reminder."
So we're trying to solve the biggest problems before we try to voice-enable everything.
"The next step, by the way, is to actually open the voice actions platform with a public API so that third party developers can then start adding different actions to do anything, right?"
"So, Spotify, for example, could say, ""Well, it's great that a user can launch Spotify and play a song or a playlist, but what about controlling the playback?"" You know, ""What about being able to say 'pause' and other thing like that?"""
"So we're going to open up the voice actions API for that stuff, and all of these actually are doable today because there's an open API on Android itself for speech."
Hopefully that answered that question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
I'm looking forward to that.
"And the second question is to--I'm sorry, the second question is to Eric."
"Now, Google TV is one of the best of product from Google, right?"
Okay?
What's your strategy to get Google
"TV into China market, because I'm a Chinese, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Well, our current strategy is to try to get it."
"Because of the partnership you saw, it has to be integrated with the content provider."
"We're trying to get it launched in the next couple of months in United States, and then we'll do a worldwide launch later or basically in 2011."
"And I won't go through the details on a per-country basis, but it's pretty obvious what we need to do."
"We need to talk to the broadcasters and make sure we have the content, get the thing certified."
"Televisions are, in fact, offered by the local manufacturers."
They have to actually install the software in their televisions.
"Go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dr. Schmidt, I'm really sorry, but I've Googled your schedule, you only have time for one more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
One more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And please try and keep it to one question.
"So, anymore?"
I think the gentleman all the way in the back.
If you could stand up and just announce yourself.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; POPl:
"Hello, my name is Luppa Popi from Symantec Eds and my question is, what's your view about Apps?"
Everybody is talking in Apps and Apple has taken this phenomenon to the
last stage.
"And when we talk about Apps in two or three year's time, what will be the mash up use cases from the Apps. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
First is I think the iPad Apps have really shown a very good model.
"X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do that is that organize them like date and time and course and what not."
"And so whenever video editors wrote script, weÃ¢ÂÂd just kind of the programming that you got from here and a little bit previously to do this automatically."
Whenever we record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it automatically and saves the video editors hours of time.
"Okay, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great and I think people once you get a little experience with programming youÃ¢ÂÂil see things like that every day that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing people could be yourself but itÃ¢ÂÂil less often be yourself spending their time doing tedious things that are not fun for humans."
That you could write a few
"lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the end of this class and I think by this point in the class many of you really should be at a level where youÃ¢ÂÂre instead of just solving the problems that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢ÂÂre finding real problems in your life and in your friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit of code."
"So, I hope everyone will be doing that and spreading the value of programming literacy beyond that, beyond just yourself."
Second thing we want to talk about building big matrices.
We're gonna build our that big A matrix today and I'm going to teach you how to use.
"Okay, so today, you know, a lot of people use FFTs And there's nothing special about that, they're just means you're a player in the game."
We're gonna learn SP Diags today.
That takes you up a level.
Cuz not a lot of people know that.
"They don't even know what you're talking about and you're like dropping on them,"
"like you don't even know that, yeah."
That's what I walk around doing all day on the ave.
I'm one of those crazy guys.
"And turns out that those dudes don't know SP Diags All right so here's what we are going to do, we're going to make this matrix, and we're going to make it to be."
We're going to chop it up to five points.
In each direction.
"In the x direction five points, Y direction five points."
So our matrix remember is not a five by five.
Remember we're going to restack out data.
It's gonna be five by five times five squared right.
So this is going to be our discretion So that is going to be the size of the matrix we are working with.
Okay.
"So first of all, let's talk about this matrix A. And let's talk about what we want to put in here."
"So first I want, I'm going to make a vector of 1s."
Big vector of ones.
"And what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna make this, what's called the spdiags command."
"And what this is, spdiags, means sparse diagonal."
Diagonals.
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.
"Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message from C, but she could modify it."
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere or something that she wanted to change.
"Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message, change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C."
"It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function."
The decryption of C' would be M'.
"The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M', because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR."
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.
"The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key."
The is this property that the number of possible keys is equal to the number of possible messages.
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.
"Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible."
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space has to be at least as big as the message space i s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
"Let's take a look at an approach for actually finding shortest paths in graphs, and we'll use this example once again."
"It will help to actually have names for the other nodes, so I'm going to add these in."
Just remember what breadth-first search does for this graph starting from A.
We mark A as visited and we add it to the open list.
We pull off the open list and add all the neighbors of A to the open list.
"Letter C, B, and D then we choose one of these nodes,"
"Let's say C and add all its unexpanded neighbors to the graph, but all its neighbors are expanded."
"Do the same thing with B. B has F, and D's unexpanded neighbors are E."
"Now, F's unexpanded neighbors are G, and E has no more unexpanded neighbors."
We finish this step for a search.
"What we get here is that by the assumptions of breadth-first search, the shortest path from A to B is this direct link from A to B."
"The search would have actually terminated here, but we ran that anyway."
These are supposedly the shortest paths in terms of number of hops to all these nodes.
It actually makes sense.
"One hop to C. One hop to B. One hop to D. Two hops to F, sure."
"Two hops to E, sure."
"As you can see at the bottom, there is the chip."
I'm sorry.
"The middle is the chip, the bottom is in the package."
"It's usually the size of a quarter, which is not too big, sometimes smaller even."
And this does all the work in your computer.
Some key terms that you don't need to know are feature size.
Feature size is the distance between two consecutive wires in the CPU.
"In this case, this computer has feature size of 45 nanometers."
That's so small that it's way too close.
"And nowadays, I believe they have a 22 and maybe sixteen coming up soon."
"Who? other things you need to know about this, that the CPUs have hundreds of thousands if not millions of transistors on them so that they could do all the computation really fast."
"And they have a multiple layers, so just"
looking at the top doesn't make much difference.
That's basically it.
One of the biggest topics when you learn
"Computer Science and when you do research in work in the development is Moore's Law, and, if you take anything away from this lecture, it should be Moore's Law."
"And Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on your chip is doubled about every two years, actually every eighteen months."
"What's Moore did, sorry, Moore is the [INAUDlBLE]."
"What Moore did was that he plotted the computers before his time for like two years and he said, you know, this has been happening so far and I'm going to predict that it's going to happen in the future and so far it has."
"As you can see in the slide, you can see a really nice straight line in a linear-log curve."
"It's a line in a linear-log curve, as you, go along it multiplies by two as every increment."
"Again, Moore's Law is super important that the transistors of a chip are multiplied by two and then they're twice as small every eighteen months."
Awesome.
A very common mistake about Moore's Law is thinking that a lot of exponential growth in computers are also relevant to Moore's Law and that's not true.
"So, here are, are a few."
"Moore's Law only talks about transistors, the top graph, And you can see that over the years, say, you can see more data points that it's held true."
Other things that have also held true is the power consumption How much power you take?
And that has basically doubled over time.
"So has the frequency, how fast your computer runs, the clocksped."
"What happens to this computers, go, have steps and every time the clock changes, they take another step."
"And as you raise the clockspeed, you make the computer faster and that has gone up."
"And the single thread performance, the speed of the computer doing one thing has also increases exponentially."
"So given that this is theta and this is 90 - theta, what is our angle going to be?"
"Well they all, collectively, add up to 180 degrees."
So you have theta + (90-theta) + our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees.
"The thetas cancel out (theta - theta), and you have 90 + our mystery angle is a 180 degrees,"
We subtract 90 from both sides.) - and you are left with your mystery angle equalling 90 degrees.
So that all worked out well.
So let me make that clear.
That's going to be useful for us.
So now we can say definitively that this is 90 degrees.
This is a right angle.
"Now what we are going to do, is we are going to construct a trapezoid."
"This side 'a' is parallel to side 'b' down here the way its been constructed and this is just one side right over here, this goes straight up and now let's just connect these two sides right over there."
So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid.
"One is we can just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area,"
And then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components.
So let's just first think of it as trapezoid.
"So, what do we know about the area of the trapezoid?"
"The area of a trapezoid,is gonna be the height of the trapezoid, which is (a+b) times, the way I think of it, the mean or average of the top and the bottom."
"So, ar(trapezoid) = (a+b) x 1/2(a+b)"
"In the intuition there you are taking the height times the average of the bottom and the top, gives you the area of the trapezoid."
"Now, how can we also figure out the area with its component parts?"
"So as far as we do the correct things, we should come up with the same result. so how else can we come up with this area?"
"Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles."
The area of each of them is one half of a times b.
"But there's two of them, Let me do that say in blue colour,"
"But there's two of these right triangles, so let's multiply them by two."
"So 2 times half ab, that takes into consideration this bottom right triangle, and this top one. and what's the area of this large one, that I'll colour in green"
"Well that's pretty straightforward, it's just one half c times c."
"So, plus one half c times c, which is one half c square."
"Now , let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with and you might guess where all of this is going."
"So, we can rearrange this."
"So this one half times (a+b) squared is going to be equal to two times one half, well that's just going to be one, so its gonna be equal to a times b plus one half c squared."
I recall the fish biting several hours later.
"But those times alone with him in a boat, on a lake, sharing thoughts, memories and laughter... no Christmas morning could top them."
I'm grateful for my Dad instilling within me the recognition of the value of a family.
"Upon marring my wonderful wife Katie and raising our three children,"
I gravitated to spending as much time as possible with them.
That meant perhaps sacrificing time with my Dad.
"None the less, I know he understood because he did the same with my mom, sisters and I."
He helped build a bond with a strength that was no more evident than our presence during the final days of his life.
"Finally, I'm grateful for my Dad for instilling within me the love of the Chicago Bears."
"As my friends who in attendance today will attest,"
I chose during my adolescent years to spend fall Sundays beside my dad agonizing the Bears losses and celebrating their wins.
"As I grew older, the phone would be our connection to chastise a poor play or simply yell into the phone to each other following a Bears touchdown."
"During my sport writing days I summarized the Bears Superbowl victory with a column confessing simply, that my love of the Chicago Bears was hereditary."
"I wrote at the time, ""As I think about the emotion that swells within me as I watch"
"'Brian's Song' for the umpteenth time,"
I see my father sitting in his easy chair.
Heredity is a difficult facet of life to ignore.
"My love for the Bears, I have come to realize, is all in the genes."
Chicago Bears - Superbowl Champions.
It has the ring of a Christmas wish.
"Well, Dad, here's to our wish finally coming true."""
"Dad, my wish today is that you have a heart-to-heart with the good lord."
To ensure a certain team from Chicago performs to the level that provides us and you with the satisfaction of another Superbowl victory in 2013 in your honor.
"And dad that you also find your peaceful lake, accompanied by Uncle Bob and Kevin, enjoying in the laughter and your limitless catch."
"And that you look down upon us in peace, knowing that your success on this earth has been measured by the love you family shares."
"And from that regard, no one in this room could be considered richer."
"My friends, the information you are about to witness from all of my years of research is the most important."
Its been hidden in plain view the entire time.
This is the ultimate secret and its about to be exposed.
THE ULTlMATE SECRET EXPOSED.
FOOD.
"I have hundred of government document, text books, white papers where for over 80 years the Elite of the western world have talked about adulterating food and water to sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics its all covered in the book "" Ecoscience "" written by the White house science czar John.P.Holdren."
"I've got a lot of time on my hands, but I don't, you know what I mean?"
"So, anyway... open mic. michaelthomas_2: ...three hours a day Monday through Friday."
"I'm looking at the prices here on Paltalk and Ghost, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you have the premium plan, which cost you $250 a month, or $249 a month."
"That means over four years Ghost spent over $12,000 giving us this time of his life and I didn't get a nap until today but that is a lot of money, man and we really appreciate you doing that for us."
"Well, yeah, $12,000 even for a rich man, that is not a small chunk of change."
That's not somethign you sneeze at.
"No, I really appreciate it man, thank you."
"Well, yeah, he can afford it, that's not the point."
It's still--
Ghost:
"Hey, this is what I""m talking about, man."
"Unappreciative, man."
You can give everything to everybody for free but they don't appreciate a goddamn thing.
"I mean, this is pretty much the synopsis of what people can get from this little Internet exercise here."
All right?
"I mean, this is much like the po' in America."
"You can give them a free house, a free car, a free job, free healthcare, free everything, but you know what?"
"They're still gonna bitch and they're still gonna be like,"
"""Yeah, man."""
GuitarNinja:
"It's a sad fact, but a lot of people are really unappreciative about everything."
"But, you know, I gotta agree with Mike Thomas, a lot of us here are very appreciative of everything you've done and the time, effort, and capital you have put into this."
"I mean, I was a bleeding heart liberal until about January of 2011,"
"I was like, had Occupy started earlier,"
I probably would've been in there and a big part of what kind of changed me into the
"I guess, call me a capitalist, you know, into the capitalist conservative, not conservative, but the kind of person I am now."
"A big part of it was listening to your show and getting the information from someone who wasn't you know, liberally slanting it and you knwo,"
"I definitely appreciate everything and don't ever think that the past couple years have been for no-- you know, there are those of us who are appreciative of it, but it is unfortunate there are a lot of people who aren't."
Never think that you wasted your time or money.
YOu have created a lot of capitalists out of this.
Ghost:
"I appreciate all the kind words in the chatroom, man but I don't see this as a --- you know, I feel bad for the people that really appreciated the show and appreciate what we were trying to do here that , you know, it's a little disappointing for them but it's good for me man, 'cause believe it or not man, my wife always told me taht this was a combination of it, man."
(laughter)
"No, I say that jokingly, but its true."
I get a huge luxury that when I make my videos
I pretend that the students are so enthralled by what I have to say that I can just imagine it.
And what's good about that is that it gives me energy...
"It's much harder to sit in front of a room full of 30 kids and you're not sure whether some are getting it, some are there, some are here."
"What happens is that.. that energy gets conveyed in the videos and when the students watch it, they can pause and repeat as many times as they want."
I just got a letter from a kid who watched one video 30 times and it took him 30 times to get the idea.
And what he said was that there no one on the planet that he could have paid to tutor him that constant 30 times without judging him.
And I think that's what students really like.
Tom:
"You do have a non-profit, you're out there in the universe of cyberspace but are any of the educational systems in this country"
- the districts - either at the local or state level - coming to you and saying 'how can we strengthen the relationship between what we need and what you do?'
Sal:
"Yes, we started some pilots last year, just almost on a whim and its gotten pretty exciting."
"Some of the local schools in the Bay Area, they said: 'what would you do if you could do anything you wanted with a 5th grade classroom?"""
"We said that we'd have every student working at their own pace: watching videos, doing the self-paced exercises."
Only moving forward once they'd mastered concepts.
Right now you get a 'B' or a 'C' on a topic.
"That's fine, you passed, even though you don't know 10 or 20% of the material."
And then you move on to more difficult topics.
"So we are saying everyone at their on pace, master concepts first and then what happens to the teachers is that they get all of this data: who is working on what, what videos are they watching."
What exercises are they doing.
So the teacher no longer has to give these 'one size fits all' lectures.
The teacher can actually get the data and say:
"""Hey look, Tom's having trouble with negative numbers, and everyone else is working at their own pace,"
"let me sit down next to Tom and actually have a 1-1 intervention with Tom."""
What we've found in the classrooms has been pretty crazy before maybe 10% of the teacher's time was spent on that really deep 1-1 mentorship.
Now it is 90% of their time.
So what we consider to be the relevant metric which is the student-to-time-with-the-teacher ratio.
That's gone through the roof.
Tom:
"Salts, you know, sodium, all of that will damage the soil and damage your plants."
"You want to avoid boron or borate, that's also going to damage your plants."
"And chlorine bleaches obviously, you know, kills things; you don't want to send it outside."
The next thing to kind of just get a little more informed is there's a lot of chemicals in our personal care products that are really just not good for us.
"And it's not really a plant issue or a Greywater issue, but it's often a good time when people are going to reuse their water, they want to think about well, what's in this stuff I'm using?"
"And so, if you're interested in doing a little more researches to database, it's called cosmeticdatabase.org."
And you can enter any product and they'll tell you what's in it.
"You know things are, oftentimes, it's kind of shocking to do this."
Any of you guys tried this?
Not yet? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"I think it's frightening, so be ready if you want to go down that route."
But it's definitely informative.
You can find out all sorts of things about the products.
And then the other thing is there's products that are recommended.
"So if you don't want to do lots of research, you know, we can tell you what products that we've researched and found to have no salt, no boron and not a lot of other carcinogenic things that are in a lot of products."
"So here are just a few examples like Oasis, Biopac, Ecos, Aubrey"
"Organics, there's more too."
"So, I'm going to talk about kind of some basic things with"
Greywater and this is just for the first way that outdoor simple systems.
"And a lot of times, it's really--Greywater is this unique source of irrigation."
So that's kind of common sense knowledge with other types of irrigation don't really fit with Greywater.
So it's important to kind of understand it and see the different kind of do's and don'ts of Greywater irrigation.
"So the do's, the things you want to do is mulch."
It's a really important component of a system.
You guys know what mulch is?
"Yeah, it's just like woodchips, you know, things covering up your landscapes so it's covering the soil."
Mulch is really important for Greywater.
You also--you always want to have a way to go back to the sewer.
"It's called a three-way valve, and Greg's going to show you one example in a sec."
You want to use plant-friendly products because it's going outside.
"And then you want to use--I put a proven designing clothes because there's, you know, so many different ways you could get your water outside."
"And there's lots of ways people can tinker and, you know, get it to go out there."
"How did not bother with their own fame, and what they left behind."
look at these men as a reference to people who have preached the Gospel of Jesus and how they gave their lives for King.
"Although few have known their names, Christ was known by them."
Then the Ministry wanted to be blessed in the sight of God.
"Not importatevi if you were to give the failed, but worry about heavenly things."
"All your suffering will be rewarded in heaven, along with the prize that Christ gives to those who serve with the heart."
"I would that all the brothers that I listen to, who are Ministers of the Gospel, are encouraged by the fact that the Lord God is immutable."
"Present in any church, whether large or small, and if God exists, is a glorious Ministry, because it is God who invites us to parectipazione."
"I think that in heaven there will be big surprises with those names that are great in the Earth, which could also be there ..."
"But those serfs who give themselves in Amazonia, they push in places undreamed of ..."
Well those are the men of real success!
"The Ministry is not determined by the amount of people that you're hearing, but for the quality of the action of the Holy Spirit in their hearts."
Don't get discouraged if you're not under the limelight ...
Be aware that the message we preach is powerful to save both Jews and Gentiles.
"Preaching boldly, and believe that God will do this."
"And if God exists, certainly the Ministry shall be blessed."
Escape from the limelight even as if they wanted to show that you can be more important than God.
"Whether you're famous, eloquent, whether you're known, none of this is important."
The only important thing is that you his faithful in delivering what the word
"God says, and not what we want the word of God says."
The human results are not important.
Sermon and sowing the word of God.
"One day the Lord will reward your efforts, your comfort heart, and we rejoice in him."
"Between listening to a great preacher, unfaithful to God, but with a good rhetoric and eloquence, and listen to a simple preacher who is not very eloquent, does not have the gift of speech, but is faithful to Scripture."
Well I always listen to preferirò the second to the first.
"Be faithful, preaches the word ama Scriptures, loves Christ."
And you'll have success.
In the eyes of God.
Some time ago I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Carson in the United States.
I was very touched.
"Told by his father, who had written a book: ""memoirs of an ordinary Pastor"" In that Conference, there were about 8000 persons there present."
"Carson with great frankness told him that many of the shepherds who were listening, are pastors of small churches and anonymous, with poor growth and does not have his own chance to speak to an audience so large."
"If we take a look at our past, about 20 or 30 years,"
"Brazil was living an era which it was open and eager for democracy, for free speech, like we have now, and we achieved them, and no one wants to lose it."
I think that is absolutely legitimate.
"But what we need to do now is ethically evolve, and build evolved values, and to me, we still need to begin moving towards that."
"But that's just an example, so what's left for society?"
"I absolutely agree, there was a philosopher who said that example isn't the best way to change character, but the only way to do so."
"And if the example that comes from above is worst, we are already lost."
"I believe in that, and if we take a look at what it takes to change a society, we need to look at other societies, the ones that work, that are evolved and developed."
"They were shaped with good examples, so, we also need to create good examples."
"Eduardo, it was wonderful having you here,"
"I want to thank you, and to conclude our chat,"
Veja Online magazine published an article which took a look at how people were rooting in social networks for Sarney to die when he had the bacterial infection in his eyelashes.
And the article was saying that it was wrong for people to be rooting for Sarney's death.
"I'm not going to ask you if you rooted for his death, but I will ask you this:"
"There is a Canadian doctor who's taking one of John Lennon's teeth, and he's promising to make a clone out of him."
Are you in favor of making a clone of Sarney?

"You know, working with charities or shooting my own personal work on vacations or, you know, walk around with a camera, that kind of thing."
"You never know, it could turn into a book,[LAUGH] and that's kind of what happened. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Nick's photos are the story of Pencils of Promise in a lot of ways it's also the emotion of Pencils of Promise."
It's going to tell our story going forward.
"I'm sorry, you want to choose something that's 5500K or higher in terms of the color temperature."
"You want to go below 5500K, 5500K is about daylight, so it's just the minimum part of daylight."
"The ones that I have I believe are 6,000K, 85 watt, 4800 lumens."
"Ok, so you can see the setup basically, it's a very simple setup."
You have the two lights that are on either side side of the screen which illuminate the background.
"Now, what I am going to do is switch around so you can see what I am looking at as I am facing the camera."
"Ok, here is my setup so what I am doing when I am reading from the screen, when"
"I am doing a professional video and looking at the camera, this is what I see."
It's in my kitchen my little dining area.
"Basically, it's a real quick setup."
"You have two lights, I am sorry, two lights on either side, so a total of four lights."
"Those are usually called the ""key lights,"" and they illuminate me as I am doing my videos."
"Now, if you zoom up, or if I zoom up I should say and focus there a little bit, you can see that they're clip-on lights."
"They are the shop lights, eight inch shop lights."
"Inside those the bulbs are actually lower wattage, they can be 26 watt cfls"
"Now, you want to choose ones that have a warmer appearance, so you are talking about warmer bulbs, you don't want to get the daylight."
"You want to get 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures."
"The ones that do the screen that illuminate the screen, those are daylight."
"These you want to warm, you want to have more of a warm appearance to whoever is on camera, and those are 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures"
"Next you see, now normally, that right there, you can see the iPad that is sitting there."
"Normally, the iPad, there's a camera, and the camera I am holding right now."
"The camera is there which I'll go over in a second, and then you have the iPad."
Of course an iPad is expensive.
"You can get a Droid tablet, that's fine."
"You can also rig up something depending on how it is, rig up something so that you could put a table, and then use a laptop as your teleprompter if you even wanted to do a teleprompter so now let's talk about the camera."
"In fact,"
let me go ahead and get my cell phone camera to talk about the camera.
"Ok, so I gave you a little tour."
"A real quick recap as you have the screen, I use a white projection screen."
"You have the two screen lights on either side, very high lumen bulbs to wash out the white background, so it's over-exposed."
"Next, I have on either side of me I have the key lights which are on each side, I have two"
"lower wattage, I think it said 26 watt bulbs, and again, held within the shop lights."
"So, when you trade it in they actually instead of you getting money for that car, you owe more for the new car you are buying and if you keep doing that eventually you will be really, really upside down."
"So really, really watch that."
It is better if you do finance it to finance it for two years or three years because you are probably going to keep it and at the end of that two or three years it is probably going to be worth more than what you owe on it if you decide to trade it in.
"We pay cash, so, I don't know a lot about that."
"But also, if you do that at the end of those three years you are going to have your car paid off instead of never getting a car paid off."
Okay?
And I know when we were younger we couldn't do that.
We couldn't pay cash for a car.
We had to go in you know and finance a car.
"But, we never financed it for five or six years like they are allowing you to do now."
Let's go on and look at page 200.
I want to really call your attention to this because you are going to use this on a project that you are going to do at the end of the semester for me.
"But, if you look on page 200, Automobile Operation Costs."
"That is something you have to consider and along with the information they have there, I want you to understand gas costs."
It is the annual mileage divided by the miles per gallon times the average cost of gasoline.
"So, you have to take, this is how much I drive this car annually and then I divide it by how many miles per gallon it gets and then I take that and multiply it times the average gas rate for that year."
And then that will tell you about how much money you are spending for gas cost.
"The cost per mile, take that total cost and divide by the number of miles that you have driven the car that year."
Okay?
It talks about maintenance.
You have to take that into consideration when you are thinking about how much a car costs.
"And then the next thing that your book goes into talking about, Resolving Consumer Complaints."
And I want you to read this.
There is a lot of information in here.
So many people just
let people run all over them and you shouldn't do that.
You have rights as a consumer.
And this chapter talks about those rights all the way up to the point of finally just taking some legal action.
And I know we live in a society of everyone sues everyone.
You know when you spill a cup of coffee and you sue the people who give it to you as if you didn't know that the cup of coffee was going to be hot!
Well then there is a problem.
Now it is one thing if someone from that business spills the coffee on you.
Let us see the words of the Tiferet Israel who is one of the commentators of the Mishnah.He writes as follows.
"""Man is compared to a tree in the bible and his wisdom is his honor"
"like the honor the branches are to a tree."""
"Wisdom is beauty just like the branches beautify the tree. ""the observance of the Mitzvot of the Torah is like the roots of the tree.The Mitzvot themselves  are the roots,when a person fulfills them.Look how contrary this is to the way people think."
"""Though,when he becomes too knowledgable.."""
"Like a person who studies a lot in the Kabbalah centers they have today,where he studies and studies but doesn't observe anything practical."
"So he says when he becomes too knowledgable,""He is like a tree that used up all his energy for its branches thereby making its energy too dull for its roots."
"Meaning,the investment itself turns out to be a deficiency."
"It is known that in nature,every tree whose strength spreads  to the very top doesn't have enough strength for the bottom."
"And the two of them,meaning the one who has many branches on top and the one who has few roots below,will uproot more easily."
Same goes for a man like this.
"""By the branching out of his wisdom of God's hidden laws"
"He learns and learns,the hidden aspects of the Torah,Kabbalah etc."
"So will the roots of his heavenly fear be lessened and weakened in his heart."""
Why?Because he doesn't apply or fulfill.
And they will both be the reason for his fall.When the wind of heresy captures him at the end it will completely uproot him from his eternal area of success.
"Meaning,you may see a person"
like this whose wisdom specifically will bury him at the end and uproot him.
Therefore it is so important to know that alongside the wisdom that a person acquires he must also apply the Mitzvot and fulfill them in everyday life.
We will conclude with one more special thing that we learn from the world of vegetation.
That is the topic of the  resurrection of the dead.
"There are many who wonder how a person who passed away and was buried,will once again be resurrected."
It sounds illogical.But a person who stands before God and asks
"Him,Tell me,God,will you really resurrect the dead in the future?"
"We've buried a person,how can he rise?"
What does God answer him?
"He says,are you surprised that I will do that?"
I do it already.
I do it in the world of vegetation.
How can a seed grow?
"You take the seed plant it in the ground,cover it and water it."
"It goes through a certain process  and suddenly from within this process where just a minute ago the seed  looked like something you could grind and make flour or bread from and now it looks bad.But from this bad looking seed,a stem comes out with a few dozen grains at its head."
So I have order n operations at each level in the tree.
And then how many levels deep am I?
"Well, that's the divide, right?"
So how many levels do I have?
"Log n, because at each stage I'm cutting the problem in half."
So I start off with n then it's n over two n over four n over eight.
"So I have n operations log n times, there we go, n log n."
"Took us a long time to get there, but it's a nice algorithm to have."
Let me generalize this slightly.
"When we get a problem, a standard tool to try and attack it with is to say, is there some way to break this problem down into simpler, I shouldn't say simpler, smaller versions of the same problem."
"If I can do that, it's a good candidate for divide and conquer."
And then the things I have to ask is how much of a division do I want to do?
"The obvious one is to divide it in half, but there may be cases where there are different divisions you want to have take place."
The second question I want to ask is what's the base case?
When do I get down to a problem that's small enough that it's basically trivial to solve?
Here it was lists of size one.
I could have stopped at lists of size two right.
That's an easy comparison.
"Do one comparison and return one of two possible orders on it, but I need to decide that."
And the third thing I need to decide is how do I combine?
"You know, point out to you in the binary search case, combination was trivial."
The answer to the final search was just the answer all the way up.
"Here, a little more work, and that's why I'll come back to that idea."
"If I'm basically just squeezing jello, that is, I'm trying to make the problem simpler, but the combination turns out to be really complex, I've not gained anything."
"So things that are good candidates for divide and conquer are problems where it's easy to figure out how to divide down, and the combination is of"
little complexity.
"It would be nice if it was less than linear, but linear is nice because then I'm going to get that n log in kind of behavior."
"And if you ask the TAs in recitation tomorrow, they'll tell you that you see a lot of n log n algorithms in computer science."
"It's a very common class of algorithms, and it's very useful one to have."
"Now, one of the questions we could still ask is, right, we've got binary search, which has got this nice log behavior."
"If we can sort things, you know, we get this n log n behavior, and we got a n log n behavior overall."
But can we actually do better in terms of searching.

"Oh, it's like an animal farm  lot's of rural charm in the country"
"He lives in a house,  a very big house in the country"
He's got a fog in his chest  so he needs a lot of rest in the country
"He doesn't drink smoke laugh,  takes herbal baths in the country"

"What we're doing in this video is study a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, that was first discovered,as far as we know by James Garfield in 1876."
What's exciting about this is that he was not a professional mathematician.
You might know James Garfield as the twentieth president of the United States.
"He was elected president in 1880, and then he became president in 1881."
And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.
What's exciting about that is is it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician or the only US president who was into geometry.
And what Garfield realised is that we can construct a right triangle-
"Let's say this side over here is length 'b'(blue) and this side is length 'a'(red), and let's say this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length 'c'."
And let me make it clear -- it is a right triangle.
He essentially flipped and rotated this triangle to construct another one that is congruent to the first one.
So let me construct that.
So we're going to have length 'b.'
"And it's colinear with length 'a', It's along the same line as length 'a.'"
They don't overlap with each other.
So this is a side of length 'b.'
And then you have your side of length 'a' at a right angle.
And then you have your side of length 'c.'
"So the first thing we need to think about is, &amp;amp;quot;What's the angle between these two sides?&amp;amp;quot;"
What's this mystery angle going to be?
"Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove to ourselves it really is what we think it looks like."
"If we look at this original triangle, and we call this angle 'theta,' what's this angle over here, the angle that's between the sides of length a and c. what's the measure of this angle going to be?"
"Well, theta plus this angle has to add up to 90, because when you add those two together, they add up to the 90."
So 90 and 90 you get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle.
"So if these two angles together is 90, then this angle is '90 minus theta'."
"Well if this angle up here is congruent -- (And we've constructed it so it is congruent.) the angle corresponding to theta is also going to be theta,"
And this angle right over here is also going to be 90 - theta.
"Just tell us whether you are her, or not.""*"
"*""We'll find out now.Vural, pass the bottle here.""*"
"*""Pour it on her."" *"
"*""I recognize this body.It's definitely her.""*"
You casted upon me the vilest violenceand the heaviest injustice.
You soiled my life with your own filth.
You brutally pillaged the life of someone you didn't even know.
Now look into my eyes and say your lies.
What the world wanted to see was how you would react.
And you all have reacted with joy and resolve.
"You've shown that your power will not be intimidated by any power that they have, and that's the most important thing that's happened here this week."
Because everything that went on inside that building tried to convince me that I was alone and that I was weak.
They tried to convince me that I was like a little finger out there on my own that could easily be broken.
"And all of you out here where the reminder for all of us that I wasn't just a finger all alone in there, but that I was connected to hand with many fingers that could be united as one fist, and that that fist could not be broken by the power that they have in there."
That fist is not a symbol of violence.
That fist is a symbol that we will not be mislead into thinking we are alone.
We will not be lied to and told that we are weak.
We will not be divided and we will not back down.
That fist is a symbol that we are connected and that we are powerful.
It's a symbol that we hold true to our vision of a healthy and just world and we are building the self empowering movement to make it happen.
"All those authorities in there wanted me to think like a finger, but our children are calling to us to think like a fist."
"And we know that now I'll have to go prison, we know that now that is the reality."
But that's just the job that I have to do.
That's the role that I face.
And many before me have gone to jail for justice and if we're gonna achieve our vision many after me will have to join me as well.
[People shouting:
"""I'll join you"" , cheering]"
Nobody ever told us that this battle would be easy.
Nobody ever told us that we wouldn't have to make sacrifices.
We knew that when we started this fight.
"Every wave on the ocean that has ever risen up and refused to lay back down has been dashed on the shore, but it is the very purpose of a wave to rise up, because once it rises above the horizon it finally has the perspective to see that it's not just a wave, that it's a part of a mighty ocean."
[Cheering]
"And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down."
"Both 8 and 10 share common factors, they are both divisible by 2."
So lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
"We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done."
"0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing as 4 fifths."
"Welcome, hope you had a good summer."
"I just wanted to talk about the class since there's about a week or so left before it starts, believe it or not."
"I, I have put something on the set, on the web."
And it's a detailed syilabus for the class.
And I would encourage you to take the opportunity to read it.
It's a big document simply because I want to give you clear sense of what you're going to get into.
And you want to make a decision that this class is good for you or not.
And even though you have resisted I encourage you to read it.
It gives you a good sense.
"But what I'm going to do in the video is I though I would give you visual idea and talk to you about the class, and it reflects what's in the syilabus."
"But hopefully, easier to follow, and motivate you to go read the syilabus."
The first main thing I will talk about are the objectives of the class.
"And to me, the main objective, the first one, is to learn how to value assets."
Assets are what create value in the world.
"And if you know which is a better asset than the other in terms of creating value for the world, I think you're on board."
"You're going to make good decisions, and that's the second, if you may, practical."
"Purpose of this class, to understand value, to make good decisions."
"And if you can make good decisions, it kind of empowers you, to feel comfortable in a very uncertain world."
"You're not guaranteed to make great decisions, but you will probabilistically make better decisions and that's what you want."
I want you to understand your environment and what public policy's all about.
Why is that important?
"Because, as"
"I said, Finance's beauty is about valuing assets but making real life decisions and all of this happens within a context and in fact the context is an outcome of our actions."
"So if you understand the interaction between decisions and what's happening and public policy, it will help you."
Now will it be a perfect understanding?
No.
"But I guarantee you when you read the popular press, you'll be able to understand things a bit better."
So that's where his account ends.
Now we're going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his own account afterwards of what happened.
Okay.
"""On Monday morning, the 5^(th) instant the town of"
"New Haven was justly alarmed, with the threatening appearance of a speedy invasion from the Enemy."
Numbers went out armed to oppose them....
"Having gone as far as I supposed was sufficient,"
I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which
"I had in my eye; but to my great surprise I saw the Enemy much nearer than I expected, their advance guards being a little more than 20 rods distant, with plain open ground between us."
"They instantly fired upon me, which they continued till I had run a dozen rods, discharging not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone; however thro' the preserving providence of God, I escaped from them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which I aimed, which concealed me from their view, while I could plainly see them thro' the weeds and bushes, advancing towards me within 12 rods."
"I singled out one of them, took aim and fired upon him."""
Okay.
So he takes one shot.
"""I loaded my musket again, but determined not to discharge it any more, as I saw I could not escape from them [laughs] and I determined to surrender myself as a prisoner."""
"So he's charged out with his gun, he takes one shot, and he's like: 'what am I doing?"
[laughter]
I'm a guy with a gun and the
British Army.
What am I doing?'
"He's like: 'okay, I'll surrender myself as a prisoner.'"
"""I begged for Quarter and that they would spare my life."
"They drew near to me, I think two only in number, one on my right hand, the other on my left, the fury of infernals glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they would kill me instantly."
"They demanded, quote, 'What did you fire upon us for?'"" [laughter]"
Okay.
I love the question.
"'Why are you shooting at us, you old crazy man sitting in the bushes?'"
"""I replied, 'because it is the exercise of war.'"" [laughter]"
That did not impress the
"British, and apparently, they actually--they didn't treat him very well so they-- one of them pretended to stab at him with his bayonet and actually stabbed him a little bit, and some of them sort of [laughter] hit him on the head, and there's a long account here which I don't have time to read in which he talks about: 'this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me on the shin and then some guy hit me with the barrel of his gun.'"
"And he actually--he ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to New Haven, from wherever he is."
"And he says I think in his account, 'I finally--I saw the"
New Haven green and I was so happy I was back in New Haven.'
"Because they're in the remote corners of those three countries, and the roads are awful, they're still very isolated."
They're still very self-sufficient.
They grow their own food.
They get water from springs.
They use local materials to make furniture and houses.
"They used to have kings and courts and armies and nobles, but colonialism put an end to all that."
"There are wondrous musicians, and they carry libraries of knowledge and stories in their heads."
The first person to write about the Zande was an anthropologist named Evans Pritchard.
"He lived among the Zande in southern Sudan for almost 2 years in the late 1920s, and he wrote this classic book, ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Zande""."
"Over 50 years later, I found myself in Zande Land."
"As a Peace Corps volunteer, that was when I was young and glamorous-- is a Peace Corps volunteer in the Central African Republic, I taught high school for three years and most of my students were Zande."
I returned to Zande Land several times to do fieldwork for my graduate degrees at the University of Paris.
My own experience with witchcraft matched up pretty well with Evans Pritchard's account.
"In English, the word witch conjures up images of old ladies with warts on their noses wearing pointy hats and riding on broomsticks."
"Zande witch is, on the other hand look like regular people."
"There your family, friends, and neighbors."
"For the Zande, some people happen to be born with a special power inside of them that can cause harm when it heats up."
And it tends to heat up in a person gets angry or jealous or is offended or feels cheated.
"When someone's witchcraft heats up, bad things happen."
The best way to explain what witchcraft does is to use an example from Evans Pritchard.
It's common for the Zande to sit under granaries during the heat of the day.
"So one day there are two men sitting under the granary, and they're just talking; chatting as friends do, and suddenly it collapses on top of them and kills them."
"If you ask a Zande the question, why did the granary collapse, just like the bridge engineer, the Zande will be able to tell you structural deficiencies."
"The posts were rotten, the termites were eating away at the posts, and so it collapsed."
But that answer is not sufficient for the Zande.
"They will also ask, why did the granary collapse of the precise moment when those two men were sitting under it?"
Why didn't it collapsed an hour earlier or an hour later?
Why didn't those two men sit at another granary that day?
So the answer to that question is witchcraft.
"In other words, witchcraft does not explain why a granary or a bridge collapses, but it does explain why a particular person is under that granary or on that bridge when it does collapse."
Another example is a hunter killed by an elephant.
Several men go on a hunt.
"And like Frank Borzage, Robsen and Lewten take this as an opportunity to embellish detail and atmosphere."
In the film.
"The film is a web of repeated and varied motifs, like knives."
"There are knives in the window in the very beginning of the film, and then Finn has a knife as our hero goes on board."
"There's a bayonet on the wall of Stone's office, and of course the film ends in a knife fight."
"Or there's the picture of Ellen on Stone's desk, which is put on top of a navigation map."
Which pretty much sums up Stones problem with his relationship.
"Or there's the way that the men have to be careful to coil the rope in just the right direction, which then echoes the way that"
Louie has to coil the chain the right way in the chain lock.
And the reason I picked this film is that sound is so important to its texture.
Just think about how many times hearing and sound are mentioned or made important to the plot.
The film begins with a blind beggar.
There's Finn who cannot speak but hears what other men can't hear.
Our hero's best friend is a radio man who puts on his headphones to block out the madness of the captain.
"When Bound talks to our hero, he says he better pull in his ears and not criticize the captain."
"The crew on the ship, does their job by using sound, not by necessarily speech."
"On the bridge, someone will ring a bell, and on the deck, that bell will be answered."
"Fog horns are, of course, important becasue they turn sound into space, they tell, they map space and dangers at sea"
Through sound.
"Billy Rad sings on the boat, to entertain the crew, but he's also expressing the real feelings of the crew."
"And since this is an inexpensive film, they can't afford to show sailors in front of actual sea."
"The most we get is a sailor in front of a the backdrop with the cloud painted on it, moving up and down a little bit."
"So, sound takes over."
The sound of the wind and the sound of the sea.
"And depending on where you are on ship, you're either the wind or the sea."
Or the sound of the engines of the boat.
And they become oppressive and meaningful across the film.
It's also an excellent film for illustrating how most Hollywood film makers use sound.
"Mixing ambient sounds and side effects, keeping dialogue on top, then bringing in an underscore orchestral music score to tell us the character's emotions even if the character isn't directly expressing them as emotions."
So I would like to take a look at.
"Bits of this film beginning at the opening scene, and think about how Robson and"
Lewton make sound important to their atmospheric horror.
"The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago, and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits."
This is Riversleigh.
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
We found marsupial lions.
We found carnivorous kangaroos.
"It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo, but these are meat-eating kangaroos."
"We found the biggest bird in the world, bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar, and it too was a flesh eater."
"It was a giant, weird duck."
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
"You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing, sitting in a pool of water."
These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
"We had, in Australia, drop crocs."
They really do exist.
(Laughter)
But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines.
"There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests, and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua."
"Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag, until a drop croc landed on her."
"At any rate, it was a fascinating place, but unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way."
"Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time, and gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out, and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline, until by five million years ago, only one left."
"By 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea, and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog -- into Australia."
"And as you can see, dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines."
That similarity meant they probably competed.
They were eating the same kinds of foods.
"It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets, and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival."
"All we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in, thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland, and after that they only survived in Tasmania."
"Then, unfortunately, the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them the things they valued, and that included sheep."
"They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania, and they thought, hang on, this is not going to work."
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.
"That was not what happened, actually."
"Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap."
"But immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them, and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw."
"By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered."
In that one we would go and check to make sure that the M characters match if we have a hash match.
And then if it could be that with such at a low probability could be that there's a hash match but not a substring match.
Then we're just.
Move on.
And from a theoretical point of view there's some very extremely low possibility that one could be slow.
But lets look over at what the analysis says.
So the theory says that if you take a sufficiently large random prime say mn^ three So a long value maybe you can get that and remember n is huge.
"Then the probability of a false collision is about 1/n. so you know in a billion things you might get, you might get 1/n, you might get a false collision."
"So in practice we choose actually q just to be, there's no reason not to choose as"
"large as we possibly can, not related to m and n.m And then the probably collision is going to be about 1/q."
"So we're going to take it to be like the biggest law, and that means that probably collision is extremely small."
And then you can take your chances.
You can do a Monte Carlo version where you just say I got a match because I got a hash match.
And be confident in the laws of probability.
And not worry about the client getting the wrong answer.
"Or you can have the Las Vegas version where you go, go ahead and return the correct answer."
And.
"And be confident that your client's not gonna run into a slow case cuz the probability is so, so tiny, 1/q, that you don't have to worry about it."
That's the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
"Now, why look at this algorithm?"
It's linear time.
We have other algorithms that are linear time.
"One of the key reasons to, be interested in Rabin-Karp is that it's easy to extend it to more complicated situations."
"So, say you wanna look for one of, several different patterns."
"Well, you just compute the hatches for those patterns, and then look for any one them Use, a symbol table, to look for'em."
"So, that's a much more, general capability than, we can provide with the other methods."
It also can be extended to do 2-dimensional search and other things like that.
"For straight suffering search, it's gonna be a little slower because, there's, interloop it's kind of long, the arithmatic operation, are gonna be a"
"little slow, if you wanna do the Las Vegas version you have to back up the text and you have this, Monte Carlo Las, Las Vegas thing, and you should think about, writing code to extend it to look for any one of p possible patterns, thats, an interesting,"
Algorithmic puzzle as I mentioned is not so difficult to solve.
So here's our summary.
"We started with a brute force algorithm, and although typically you don't have this worst case thing."
And we know from the other property of linear transformations that the transformation of a vector multiplied by the scalar is the same thing as the scalar multiplied by the transformation of the vector.
That's just from our definition of linear transformations.
Plus x2 two times the transformation of e2 plus all the way to xn times the transformation of en.
"Now, what is this?"
"I could rewrite this, so everything I've done so far, so the transformation of x is equal to that, which just using our properties of linear transformations, all linear transformations, this has to be true for them."
I get to this and this is equivalent.
"This is equal to-- if we view each of these as a column vector, this is equal to what?"
"This is equal to the matrix where this is the first column, T e1."
And then the second column is T e2.
"And then we go all the way to T en times-- let me put it this way-- x1, x2, all the way to xn."
"We've seen this multiple, multiple times."
"Now what's really, really, really neat about this is I just started with an arbitrary transformation."
"And I just showed that an arbitrary linear transformation of x can be rewritten as a product of a matrix where I'm taking that same linear transformation of each of our standard basis vectors, and I can construct that matrix, and multiplying that matrix times my x vector is the same thing as this transformation."
So this is essentially showing you that all transformations--
let me be careful.
All linear transformations can be a matrix vector product.
"Not only did I show you that you can do it, but it's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do."
This is actually a pretty simple operation to do.
Let me show you an example.
"I don't know, I think this is super neat."
Let's say that I just-- I'm just going to make up some transformation.
Let's say I have a transformation and it's a mapping between-- let's make it extra interesting-- between R2 and R3.
"And let's say my transformation, let's say that"
"T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's say the first entry is x1 plus 3x2, the second entry is 5x2 minus x1, and let's say the third entry is 4x1 plus x2."
This is a mapping.
I could have written it like this.
"I could write T of any vector in R2, x1, x2, is equal to-- and maybe this is just redundant, but I think you get the idea."
"I like this notation better. x1 plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and then 4x1 plus x2."
This statement and this statement I just wrote are equivalent.
And I like to visualize this a little bit more.
"Now, I just told you that I can represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
How do I do it?
"It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall."
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
"It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species."
"These are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin, who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart."
"To add insult to injury, having swept this species nearly off the table, this animal, when it died of neglect --"
The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
"It died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin, they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump."
Does it have to stay this way?
"In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum."
I was fascinated by thylacines.
I've always been obsessed with these animals.
"And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old."
"The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol."
"I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative."
"But this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends, couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA, if it's there, and then somewhere down the line in the future, we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?"
The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly.
Cloning was science fiction.
It had not happened.
But then suddenly cloning did happen.
"And I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,"
I'm going to give this a go.
I put a team together.
"We went into that pup to see what was in it, and we did find thylacine DNA."
It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited.
"Unfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA."
"Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen, put their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,"
"""Wow, look at that,"" plop, dropped it back in the jar, contaminating this specimen."
And that was a worry.
"If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back, what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed, was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine."
"It would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy."
"And to illustrate this,"
"I'd like to talk about  a project called ""Planet Hunters""."
"So Planet Hunters is a project that's been running for a few years now, and we thought we'd try  and discover planets around other stars."
This is the most exciting area of astronomy right now.
We thought there might be a few planets left over for our citizen scientists to catch.
"Now whenever you go hunting planets,  you can't see the planets directly."
What you have to do instead is look for  the indirect signs that they're there.
"And one of the most effective methods  is to look for what we call ""Transits""."
A planet transiting in front of its star will cause the start to dip in brightness  by much less than 1%.
"But if you can catch that dip, then you can infer that the planet is there."
"It's a rather simple case of Dark Matter, if you like."
You can infer that this planet is there from the data.
"And we have data from NASA's Kepler satellite, which is staring -- actually Kepler, I feel rather sorry for it, it's got the most boring job in the world, because it just stares at 150,000 stars, and every 29 minutes tells us what brightness they are."
"It can send that data down here, and we can look for these transits."
And sometimes these transits are really obvious.
( beeping )
"In fact, in this case, they're so obvious that you can hear them."
That modulation is the dip at the repeated transit of a planet orbiting its star in just a few days.
But sometimes the transits aren't so obvious.
"This is what it might just look like to be on a moon, orbiting a Neptune sized world, now know as Planet Hunters 1B."
This was a planet discovered by a group of citizen scientists using our project.
And Planet Hunters 1B is currently a unique world.
It's the only world that we know of  that has 4 suns in its sky.
"So this is a system with 2 pairs of stars, and a planet orbits one of those pairs."
It's a planet that simulations tell us shouldn't exist.
So we didn't even know to look for this and yet there it is.
And it's there because a group of volunteers saw something strange in the data and they didn't even tell us about it.
"They went out, they got more data from the professional NASA website."
"They did their own analysis, and they came to us when  they'd worked out what was going on."
"These were people who did not start off as scientists, who'd gone through the engine of motivation, being convinced that they could do something real by taking part in the main project and then collaborated together to make a truly gobsmacking discovery."
"And then we made the nice image, so that they could try and image  what that planet was like."
This is real citizen science.
This occurred there.
"Because it knows who I am, it knows what I care about and it knows roughly where I am."
"So this notion of autonomous search, the ability to tell me things that I didn't know but I probably am very interested in, is the next great stage in my view of search."
"And ultimately, we think we can understand things like what you really meant."
"So, for example, you ask the question, ""What's the weather like?"" That's the question."
"And what you're really asking is, ""Do I wear a raincoat?"" Right?"
"Or, ""Do I water the plants?"""
"We think we can make that bridge or get closer to it, to understand, ""What did you really mean?"
"What is the problem you're really trying to solve?"" We've also thought a lot about new areas in commerce, specialize searches of one kind and another."
We brought a company called ITA around travel.
"So we're very, very interested in making it possible to answer very deep questions using Computer Science about things that you care about."
"It's interesting that--that one in three queries from smartphones is now from about where I am, where my location is, something around me."
"So, we know that users are doing this and we know they're doing it a lot and it makes sense to them."
"So, the area of mobile--it's interesting that our most mobile search traffic grew 50% in the first half of 2010."
It's growing much quicker than everything else.
"So, not only is--do I believe my strategy is correct here, but also the data says that our users really, really like this."
"It's interesting that Android and I, of course, I hope everybody has their Android phones with them."
"Android is shipping about 200,000 activations per day now, and God knows what the growth rate is going to be."
It's so fast.
"What's interesting about Android, of course, is it's not just one partner."
"There are more than 60 devices and 21 OEM partners across 59 carriers in 49 countries, and that number is growing very, very quickly."
"And you can imagine those numbers will be much, much greater before Christmas because of all the new products that are coming out."
"Search traffic from the Android phones tripled in the first half of 2010, another example of all us taking on."
Another part of this is a browser strategy.
Everybody here knows what browsers are; the things that you use when you are using the Internet?
We have a browser which we like a lot called Chrome.
It's based on an underlying technology called
"WebKit, which is very much the fastest underlying browser technology."
It's used by many of the browsers now and that's part of why it's so quick.
"And in Chrome's case, it's getting--it's got a huge momentum; it now has more than 70 million users."
"It's--the latest release is four times faster, that are really four times faster than the release we did two years ago."
And deeper integration with the browser means that we can have more autonomous actions.
"But instead of setting a temporary ID to the element, to save time, I can just type $0 in the console."
This is a shortcut reference to whatever element is currently selected in this panel.
"It's just a regular reference, so if I'm using jQuery I can toss it into it's dollar method easily."
"Now over on the Network tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"In this waterfall chart, two lines are added."
"The blue one points out where the DOMContentLoaded event fires, which is basically ""document ready"" and the red is window's load event, which waits for all images and iframes to finish."
Now you probably have had to inspect the cookies that are associated with your page request before.
"The Headers tab has that info as one of the request headers, but you can now view the current cookies in table format."
"You also have the size of each cookie, which you want to keep as small as possible, as all the cookies are sent in the HTTP header with every request of the page."
"Now, I'd like to show you a few handy features when doing Javascript debugging."
I'm going to bring up a page with some basic script.
"So here, I can filter our results here using search or a category filter."
Easy enough.
This gallery.js contains most of the functionality.
Now I'd like to add some logging to see what's going on.
"In Chrome, I can edit the script on the fly inside the Ul."
This feature is unique to Chrome because of how the V8 Javascript engine executes your code.
I'm going to jump down to the showGallery function.
I can use cmd-G or ctrl-G to jump to a specific line number.
"Now I'd really like to dig into this JSON argument here, so I'm going to console log it out."
"Now when I filter, I get the object logged to the console, where I can poke around with it further."
You'll notice I'm also getting an exception thrown on the page.
Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where these errors are coming from.
"By clicking on this pause button, I can ask the dev tools to pause execution whenever an exception is encountered, effectively giving me a breakpoint at that position."
"I can now open up the console, again by hitting"
"Escape, and figure out what's going on."
Whoops!
Looks like that element doesn't exist yet.
I guess it's time to file a bug report.
"If you'd like to dive into the dev tools, I definitely recommend picking up a dev channel version of Chrome."
It updates weekly and gets new features in the dev tools very regularly.
Holding your baby is something that's very different for every individual you really need to hold them in a way that is most comfortable for you.
"We were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there, and managed to find some sharks."
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see a shark running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
And here it is.
Look at that lovely black shark slime.
"And in about half an hour, we got five samples."
Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now, and they're a bit more dramatic."
You probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
"And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins."
But hey -- sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
So this is possibly going to be my legacy --
Simon's Shark Slime.
We got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples.
"One thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark."
"What you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers, which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark."
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
"If we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it, we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female."
"Because in the moment, they have no way, genetically, of telling the difference between a male and a female, which I find staggering, because they don't know what primers to look for."
"Being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through the sightings, because it is illegal to trade in these sharks."
And they are caught and are on the market.
"So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals, and learn as much as you can."
"They're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained."
You just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
"But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines, such as the geneticists, who can gain so much more from that."
"So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways."
Grab them while you can.
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.
"Hopefully, I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die."
"But for the time being, thank you for that."
And keep an eye out for sharks.
"If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now set up."
"So, I'm really good at taking notes on this; I am terrible at editing."
And it just means if I really wanted to become good at actually...
"If I had to do final papers or let's say documents for my boss or something on this device, I would really have to practice using that before and after letter, ah, issue I was just talking about."
But it's really confusing if you're not used to it.
"Because sometimes you're before the letter, sometimes you're after, depending on the direction you've moved."
And I'm making a big deal of that because I don't want that to throw anyone or convince anyone not to do this.
"Ah, it's just something that if you practice with, it's fine."
"When I go to meetings, I just do a lot of writing."
And there's a thing in here where you can email the note to yourself.
"And you get all the text, errors included, and that works out great."
"There's actually, If I can input here, there's actually a very good article on macaccessibility.net and that's www.macaccessbility.net, under the tutorials section that describes the cursor and how the cursor in mac or ios differs from the cursor in Windows."
"Uh, it describes it really well."
"That's what I read when I started using the ios devices cuz it got, it got me confused too."
"I'm like 'Wait a minute,'"
"'I didn't want to delete that character, I wanted to delete the one to the left.'"
"Then I read that article and now I realize that the cursor is different between the two operating systems, and so it's ah..."
I still make mistakes myself.
It takes a bit of getting used to.
I have done editing on here.
"But yeah, it's, It's definitely different than Windows."
[new speaker]
"And it's actually kind of neat because it's much more precise, but if you're not used to it it can really throw you."
And I don't want to waste everyone's time.
"If I were home, I'd spend the next ten minutes making this pristine just for the challenge, but I'm not going to waste everybody's time and do that."
[Audience member]
Thank you.
"Um..There's a lot of different places throughout the iPhone that you can actually go into edit mode, you'd like to be able to go into edit mode, like in the search fields, and um, and ah, text messaging, and things like that."
"Does this keyboard, this edit mode, work in every single one of the iPhone apps?"
Or does it only work in the notes?
"Um, the keyboard will work in any of the edit fields."
That's the nice thing about all of the ios devices.
"If you have an edit field in texting, or whether it's in notes, or Navigon, or any field, or any application, this keyboard's going to work with it. cuz an edit box is an edit box. and if the developer has-- [sudden library announcement over PA system]"
So we will often reject a paper.
Right away.
And now let me just tell you the process that we go through at the American Journal of Epidemiology.
"At first, it's looked at by the editor-in-chief and then he assigns it to one of the other editors, who really makes the final decision and I happen to play that role, as a general epidemiology editor."
"There are other more specialized editors that work just in cancer, or just in cardiovascular disease or just in infectious diseases, but I tend to be more general."
And so.
"If the two of us think that the paper is not going to be of sufficient priority to be accepted, even if it's good science and well-reviewed, then as a favor to the authors, we won't delay a rejection of it."
"Another, beside novelty, another criterion we look at is interest to the readers of this particular journal."
"For example, sometimes we'll get a paper that really is not so much an epidemiological study, but a way to improve public health, and we will decide, you know, this is really."
"More suitable to a, to a public health journal then to the American Journal Of"
Epidemiology.
"We, also look for good writing, and this can be especially a be a problem, with a non-english speaking author."
"Usually when a paper comes from a foreign country, often the english is, really, bad and we know it's gonna need a lot of work, and we think it's a good study, we will often, send it back and say please have a, someone, a native english speaker go through this and edit it."
"And occasionally this comes, when a foreign, person who is, who's english who's, lang, need of languages not english."
It works in an American institution and submits a paper.
So you know usually that is not a problem.
But it can be.
Mm-hm.
Another Fact.
"Factors that you know, don't make the paper too long."
Don't put in too much excess material that's not needed.
And another important problem is what we call slicing the salami too thin.
"Yes, yeah that would be great for you to say a bit about it."
"You know, if you, [laugh], I have a study that involves both men and women and want to try to get two papers out of it say here's what that risk factor, here's the effect of this risk factor in men."
And then another paper here's the effect of this risk factor in women that is really frowned upon by journals.
And my own personal experience is that I was I had to deal with this as an author.
"A colleague and I, each wrote a paper about health effects of cigar smoking."
This was at Kaiser Permanente.
His was on cardiovascular disease.
Mine was on cancer.
"I submitted I, mine to the, Annals of Epidemiology and was accepted."
He submitted his to the New England Journal.
"Which is that when you stop the front end of the garage, of the ladder, you also stop the"
left end of the ladder.
"Remember, that at this point the right end of the ladder smashes into a wall, and it stops."
"Now, what is going to happen is the back end of the ladder just lik e our slinky, when I dropped it has not yet heard that the front end of the ladder has crashed into something."
The left end of the ladder continues to come at speed v until somebody tells it.
What tells it?
"Well, a sound wave, of course will be propagating down this ladder as the front end of it crumples, propagating back to tell the back end of the ladder, wait, there is an extra force, we need to stop."
How fast does the sound wave travel?
"Well that depends on what the ladder is made of, but I know a limit."
"The sound wave will not travel back to the ladder in it's own frame, or in any other frame that's happily an invariant faster then the speed of light."
"So at this event when the front end of the ladder crashes into the door, you can imagine a sound wave propagating back up the ladder to the left, trying to tell the left end to stop."
"So, how fast can this signal propagate?"
"Well, this is the fastest it can propagate."
"The fastest that the rear end of the ladder can hear, but the front has stopped, is the speed of"
light.
"So I've drawn a light speed, 45 degree propagation of the signal from the back of the ladder, from the front of the ladder to the back telling it to stop."
"And if this were the case. you notice that by the time this light being reaches the back end of the ladder, back end of the ladder is well within the garage because even in the ladder frame, we are now talking about a positive time."
Right?
"And so, time has"
"The, the, remember, the left end of the ladder entered the garage here."
"By now, the left end of the ladder is well in the garage."
If you stop the front end of the
"ladder, the back end would keep coming."
"You would not, be able to stop it until it was in the garage."
"Now, what happens at the moment."
To the actual ladder when the soundwave) propagates and reaches the back.
Well the energies involved are such that most ladders would probably blow themselves up to smithereenes or crumble to atoms.
But in any event by the time the rear end of the ladder appears that the front end has stopped.
And ma ybe we have a very powerful ladder and it's elastic and it springs back out and re-expands by the time all that and crashes into the garage door.
"But the time, by the time all of that, any of that happens the ladder is well within the garage."
And so the fact that you managed to close the doors.
"Is not an interruption when you close the doors. at this event, the ladder, had, the"
"So I, I was hoping you could comment on that."
[laugh].
"Well I. I, I don't think you'll necessarily dumb down the science."
"And, of course you do want precision and clarity."
"But, I think you should avoid jargon and things that are really hard to understand."
"George Comstock, who's no longer alive but he was used to be the Editor in Chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology, used to say that, papers should be understandable by someone with a good college education or someone who reads the Scientific American."
"It does not have to be full of jargon that's only understood by your, your peers and your particular specialty."
Yeah.
So I would.
You know we welcome things that are very readable and easy to read.
"I don't, I, I, I would not have that fear at all."
Yeah and.
"In terms of getting published when you get two papers in and say they were the same science and one was very jargony and you know, sounds sort of the way, scientists think they have to write and you have one that's clear, can you comment on your chances of publication."
"Well you know, if both of them get peer reviewed and, and very highly rated and they seem like, they seem important to the editors we might ask."
"You know, to please explain what you mean by this, word or by this sentence?"
"Yeah, yeah."
So it will take an extra step if it's really hard to understand and not clear to most readers.
"Yeah, yeah."
And what advice can you give specifically to first time authors?
"I imagine a lot of, the students in this course are, you know, early in their career."
"And haven't had a chance to get published yet or, or, in the process of submitting their first papers?"
"What bothers me most, is when I get a paper, you know, often be from a really good institution and the senior author at the end of the list is someone who's well known, but it's clear its been written by a student, [laugh], and, if it sounds like a thesis, it sounds like a Phd thesis, or masters thesis, Which, and it contains every conceivable strength of the study, every conceivable weakness, [laugh], so that, to prove, in writing the thesis they learned what they were supposed to learn in a school public."
Author in their graduate program.
"So, Right is if you were more established senior scientist who knows what other scientists understand."
"And, you don't have to explainuh, something to everything."
"I just happened to see a paper this morning in the latest journal of the American Journal of Epidemi-, the latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology that was going over the strength and limitations of there study."
"And, it was a study about mortality and, in whites and African Americans and related to a certain."
"Factor, and I was saying, one of the strength of our study is that we had a"
large African American.
Population as part of this study group.
"Well, that's sort of obvious or you wouldn't."
"Right, right, [laugh]."
let that fade away.
"You have to think about, OK, just the interface."
Is the interface conveying the right things?
"And then beyond the interface, the mental model."
How is the user simulating this in their head?
What information are they getting out of it?
"So back to the diagram, letting that implementation fade away."
So that's self-describing.
"At least, that's talking about if something should be self-describing, but how do you pull that off?"
"It's one thing to say it's important, it's another thing to tell you literally how to do it."
So there's at least five ways.
"The first one is consistency, and this is cheating, basically."
"It works great, but it's also a kind of a tautology to say, hey, if I design something that's things that the user already knows, they're going to know how to use it."
That is true.
"You do not have to rely on this entirely, though."
"In fact, Google products are often very different from what's already in the marketplace, and they still are able to bootstrap knowledge from users and have them figure it out."
"I mean, in the case of Gmail, it was sort of a radical reimagination of how email interfaces worked, but it still worked."
"And also, if everyone did consistency all the time, we wouldn't see dramatic innovation in interfaces."
So we're not going to focus on this one too much.
"Basically, it's really useful, and you can guarantee that users are going to understand your application if you focus on consistency, but it's not the only way."
So the second one is affordances.
"Let's go back to the test chamber, and let's say one day, they encounter this, and they've never seen it before, and they're thinking, whoa, that's really interesting."
This might actually be a way out of the test chamber.
And how are they going to figure that out?
Everything about this design is designed to convey what it does.
"The way that the door is recessed from the frame, the curvature of the handle, the way that you can just imagine the handle rocking in."
"You might not know on which side of the door it's going to open, and you might not know what the words mean, but the picture sure looks like yourself and it seems to be going through it."
But that's sort of cheating.
"Just the physical design of this has been very carefully crafted so that when you look at it, you understand what it's going to do."
You understand that you need to push on it.
"And this is a type of thing that we do just throughout the day, constantly, where you encounter stuff and you have to look down and say, I'm going to push on that."
"It's just this kind of thing that cognitively, you're just constantly doing without really even thinking about it."
It's a stupid world.
"Let's go back to the beginning, OK, to the very first browser and the very first server."
"Initially they were both on the same machine, but eventually they figured out how to put a wire between them, and that was a good thing, that's when it started to get interesting."
"Pretty quickly you get to the point where you've got so many browsers trying to attack one server that one server can't do it anymore, so we had to start thinking about how we're going to scale."
"Historically what we did was put a distributor in front of the servers, so each request that comes in can route either at random or round robin or least loaded, whatever policy you want."
The message goes somewhere else and that server deals with it.
Then you've got a database in the back that they can all share.
The database becomes a problem -- that becomes a bottleneck.
"Initially everybody was using some kind of relational database there, which I think was a really bad fit for this."
The relational database was developed at IBM back in the mainframe era to solve a completely different class of problems than we have here.
"But there were a lot of people who understood how they worked, and understanding how they work means you don't have to rethink anything, so great, we'll just take that and put it in."
And they didn't scale.
"So in the decades since then, we've done a lot of things — figuring out how to shard them and do other stuff -- and in doing that you break the relational model, so most of the goodness you got from that model you don't get any more."
"But at least you don't have to rethink anything, OK, so"
life continues.
"But at some point even that doesn't work, so you start looking for other options."
"People have come up with no SQL databases, which are wonderful."
I love these things.
There's
"Mongo, and Couch, and all the others."
They're great.
"People are kind of going back and changing the assumptions, and going what's really important here?"
The important thing often is scalability.
"You're going to trade off a lot of other things in order to get that, and we're getting it, so that's really good."
It turns out Yahoo!'s been doing this for a long time.
"We had a massive home grown no SQL database introduction here since 1996, so we've been doing this for a long time too."
It's wonderful stuff.
But now let's put Ajax on top of all of this.
This model was not designed for Ajax.
"This was something that we kind of figured out after the fact that we could do, and it's not optimal for us."
The biggest problem is: where does the server put its state?
"Because this model assumes that it's stateless, so that any request can go to any server."
"What it is it's sort of like charismatic power - being likable, having a charm factor, being respected highly, being looked up to for who you are, for you integrity, for the way you think, for the way you're cool and calm and rational, and you're cooperative and collaborative, and you just have these characters that people admire."
You're actually going to see this in some of your assignments.
Maybe you'll see it in groups you belong to.
You know people like this.
"Everybody follows them because they seem to know how to act, but also their ideas are pretty good, and they just set such a good example by the way they are."
"The third type of power, we tend to use it too much, it's called expert power."
"You know it's having the answers, having some knowledge, bringing knowledge in from our past."
We have the answers because we've done this before.
"You know, every group needs expert power."
"You need people who are veterans who have some experience, so they can bring it to the group as long as it's not overdone or telling the group what to do or the know-it-all."
You've got to be real careful about overusing expert power.
"Let the group sort of make its decisions, bringing ingredients in appropriately as an information giver, as we talked about that role, rather than trying to control outcomes by overusing expert power to sway a group toward something you think is best."
The fourth of these types of power is called reward power.
"Now, reward power is the ability to give people something, some kind of perks."
"Maybe, ""I'll bring refreshments next time, again."""
"And everybody says, ""Ah, I love that."""
Maybe you're a good cook; you can bake something.
"I was in a Bible study once, and it was a men's Bible study, a bunch of farmers six in the morning, and we all took turns."
It was such a cool thing.
There was a reward there though.
"It was almost like, you brought the cookies, you brought the baked goods, cinnamon rolls, and you made the coffee, and everybody took turns giving perks, and it was all sort of a cool thing."
"If you've every been in a group, maybe somebody in the group says,"
"""Alright if we succeed in this, I'll buy everybody dessert at Applebee's after the meeting if we can figure this out by nine o' clock."""
"So, if there is some reward power everybody is on task."
They want this to happen.
"And the next of these, the fifth type of power, is what we call coercive power, where we punish people."
"We don't like somebody's idea, so we try to embarrass them."
We try to criticize them; we try to shut them down.
We try to get them to be quiet.
And those are not good things.
"And this is where gate keeping comes in, so we don't allow people to misuse gate keeping to quiet down people while letting other people talk more."
And the last of these is persuasive power.
That's gonna be hot.
It's nice!
Very savoury but soft!
A little bit different from your normal grain.
"So, I hope you enjoyed your savoury oatmeal dinner, we're gonna have ours put in a plate and topped it off with the avocado and enjoy it here on the roof top in Kas."

In 2007 the crisis in the real-state market spread fast around the world
Millions of people lost their houses and their jobs ?
We are deep in shit and we all know it but we still trust that all is not going to fall apart
Is capitalism destroying itself and
I think that is all splosh
Capitalism
Karl Marx and the critique of Capitalism is undergoing a revival today
To bring Marx's Kapital to the stage is a crazy edeavour
The success of this play is very astonishing for me fully unexpected
The achivement of Capitalism is the limitless capacity or commodities
But how can Marx's criticism of capitalism can help us to gain a better understandig of this crisis?
The question from Marx is not aimed at more critique
From where does all the enthusiasm with everything that has to do with Karl Marx comes?
"In a lot of countries in the West, dealing with your waste, you're kind of separated from it, you put it in the bin and it magically disappears."
"Someone comes, it's all arranged for you."
You don't have to think about it.
"And here, you have to make an extra effort, because there really isn't a system, so you have to think about it."
You're confronted with it.
"So even though there's a really bad problem, there's a positive side, because you're forced to recognize the problem."
You're forced to have to deal with it.
"So looking at that side of it, it's really an opportunity for people to kind of confront their their consumption, their pollution."
"Bali has a problem about every year our coastal, when it's the season once a year, a lot of plastic garbage landed in Kuta coastal."
The government said this is because of the sea tides.
"It's not about the sea tides, from my opinion, it's about people still throw plastic garbage in the river or in the canals and they flow to the ocean, and the ocean will bring it back to the land."
"Waste management is a little bit the land of no one, no?"
"I mean it's a little bit, you can almost do whatever you want without really being caught. / But the garbage problem affects everybody, rich and poor, and if you can't deal with that basic problem- pollution from your waste- then how are you going to deal with these large, more complex problems, like deforestation, destruction of the coral reef, and climate change."
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store... [instrumental and chorus]"
"[rhythmic dripping, haunting melody continues]"
And here we have the result of some simulations of the exploratory agent.
We see it's doing much better than the passive agent or than the Greedy agent.
So I'm graphing here; and we only had to go through 100 trials.
We didn't have to go through 500--so it's converging much faster.
And it's converging to much better results.
"So the policy loss and the dotted lines started off high; but after only 20 trials, it's come down to perfect."
"So it learned the exact, correct policy after 20 trials."
"The error in the utilities--so you can have the perfect policy, while not quite having the right utilities for each state-- and the errors in utility comes down, and that, too, comes down to a level that's lower than the previous agent's-- but still, not quite perfect."
"And we see here that it, in fact, learns the correct policy."
"Now that we have constructed Hilbert spaces and Orthonormal bases, we can see some of their distinguishing features."
"One of them is norm conservation, which is called Parseval's theorem, and is an extension of Pythagoras' famous Orthonormality theorem to infinite dimensions."
"Then, we will see the Orthogonal Projection Theorem."
This is a powerful method to take a vector from possibly an infinite dimensional space and project it onto a subspace.
"Once we have this, we will consider some examples of approximations and orthonormal bases."
Modules 3.3 Hilbert Space and Approximation.
The overview of this submodule is the following.
"First, we look at the norm conservation, in particular Parseval's formula."
"Then, we look at the approximation by the projection method, and finally we explore a few examples."
"Parseval's theorem: we know that if we have a basis for space, any vector x can be written as a linear combination, summed from 0 to K-1, αk, wk."
"For an orthonormal basis, there is this beautiful formula which says that the squared norm of x, ||x|| squared is equal to the sum of the coefficents of expansion squared, or Parseval's formula."
Let us verify Parseval's formula on a simple example.
"We have the canonical basis E, e0 on e1, and we can write x as α0, e0, α1, e1."
"Let us look at the new basis, the blue one, which is given by v0 and v1."
"V0 is equal to cosθ sineθ transpose, v1 is minus sinθ cosθ transpose."
"And x can of course also be written as a linear combination of v0 and v1, namely, β0, v0, plus β1, v1."
"And to trust that even though  sometimes circumstances seem to conspire against us for things not to happen  the way we want to, in fact they actually are  a result of how much effort we put in pursuing our passions, and how we use our  sensitivity to understand other people and to  support each other."
"After all, what is ""to trust""?"
To trust is to not get offended.
Trust is when you are able to...
"Trust is to not get offended, and  allow yourself to give your best, because that is the only way  of having no regrets, so that when your time finally comes,  you will be able to leave this world a much better place  than when you arrived in it."
Thank you!
(Applause)
"So, this is my grandfather,"
"Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table."
He never went back to school.
"Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores."
"Salman was the consummate perfectionist, and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture."
"He was also the ultimate self-learner, and like everything else, he did it in grand style."
"He surrounded himself with an entourage of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka, and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace."
"And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming."
"He fled Germany, together with his family,"
leaving everything else behind.
"His department stores confiscated, he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture."
"This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House."
Such is the power of self-study.
And these are my parents.
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
They were too busy building a family and a country.
"And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong, tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked with thousands of books, records and artwork."
"I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set, then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio."
(Laughter)
"And that's me,"
"I was going to say holding my first abacus, but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad."
(Laughter)
So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach.
"Instead, they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own."
"Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment: these are the virtues of a great education."
"Part of this process is to help people understand that this is possible, and create a demand for it."
"And if there's a demand, then people will take this information and start producing the product, which doesn't exist for the large part for many people."
"Believe me, people ask me, how fast could a transition be made?"
You know what?
In two years this could become the dominant agricultural paradigm.
"All it takes is for Americans to say, this is what I want."
"Because, believe me, there are thousands of small farmers around this country poised, able and ready to scale up."
"But they're not good marketers, they're whatever."
"We're going to talk about that later, some of the really exciting developments that you've encountered, within your local community, is the adoption of internet technology and social networking to allow that transition to occur, to easily sell the product."
"Yes, that's what we're needing to have, is aggregators, that crucial aggregator marketer."
"As I see it, the technology is here, the land is here, the knowledge is here, we just need people that are willing to say, you know what?"
I don't need that Caribbean cruise this year.
I'll take that thousand dollars and I'll buy better food.
And maybe I'll feel better.
"That's what we need, we need people to make that life adjustment, and as that happens it's going to be a good thing."
This is the only herd that we have right now that isn't being mob stocked.
"Because here we just made hay, and we've got all this poultry, so we're trying to just clean a little bit ahead of these, so they're in a pretty big paddock."
The paddock goes from the turkeys over here.
"We're just trying to clean up around the fringes, where the mower couldn't get."
But you get a sense of it.
Some of the grass finished beef here.
"This is what we call ""salad bar beef""."
"Everyday they get a new paddock, yesterday they were over there, today they're here, this afternoon they'll move into that next paddock right there."
"What we're doing here is we're just kind of cleaning up after we made hay, to kind of clean the fringes of the field where the mower couldn't get, and that sort of thing."
"These are grass finished beef, as opposed to grain, and grass-fed, that used to mean the same thing, and now it's become a distinction."
"Kind of like the term ""natural""."
It's been perverted and bastardized.
"Exactly, exactly."
"Grass-fed, the fact is that all cows in the US are grass-fed at some point in their lives."
And then they go into a feedlot for four months.
And it only takes 14 days of grain feeding to chase most of the conjugated linoleic acid out of the body of a ruminant.
"Two weeks and they're at it for four months, in the typical factory farm."
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
What was that again? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Two last questions from me, and Vic did a great job on the panel on the mobile Internet a few moments ago."
Would you be willing to opine in your lifetime when mobile-related revenue search might surpass PC-based revenue?
Given that we now know where the future is going? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It clearly will.
It's a question of the growth rate of data-capable mobile devices.
"The reason it clearly will is that the monetization of the ads should be higher, because they're even more targeted."
"So we have a lot of evidence, and Vic talks about this in his speeches, where when you have a powerful browser, whether it's the I-Phone, is a good example, the Blackberry now has one, obviously the Android phones, as they come out."
"People spend many, many more searches when they finally have a capable browser."
"And so one of the things, one of the questions is what's new in the technology sense, as opposed to the financial market sense, and the development of this new, open source browser that all these things are based on, really does create that first step of a whole new platform."
So how long does it take?
"The answer is, a few years."
But not a few decades. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"One last question from me, and then I'll turn it over to others."
You have been a great partner with your revenue-sharing agreements with thousands or millions of other players.
"You don't necessarily get the credit for it that, in my humble opinion, you should."
But you're offering those sorts of compelling deals to content providers.
You're offering an Android operating system to the mobile device market.
"And this goes back, it's the same question, slightly differently, do those offers become more compelling to standouts in the next six to 12 months than they have been in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Do you mean people who have previously said no? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
Yep. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, I think one of the first principles of business is that they say no this year and maybe they'll say yes next year."
We're working really hard to create ecosystems that have enough differentiation and enough innovation that people want to play in them.
"And we're also trying to do business terms that are non-exclusive, so that everybody has access to it."
So there's certainly no prohibition from people doing it.
"In the Android case, it was discussed at the 3GSM conference that there are quite a few partners that have pre-announced their intent to offer Android-based devices of one kind--and some of these things look like phones but some of them are, in fact, not phones."
"And that obviously, then, creates the cycle for more applications."
And that'll bring more people to the party.
"I think people in the room here understand how platform businesses work, and it's fundamentally about momentum."
And without that health insurance...[cuts off]
When someone is born with a malformed heart valve there's no question we cover the treatment necessary to care for that person.
"Similarly, there should be no question that when someone is born transgender we provide the care they need."
There are clear Standards of Care for treatment of a legitimate diagnosis.
Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria are recognized medical terms &amp;amp; diagnoses.
"I have read one of these exclusionary insurance statements, and it is just appalling."
"Uh, the idea that, uh, it would be, and it is, it's the equivalent of saying"
"""we will not give insurance to short people."""
"You know, it is how you are born."
This is not about cost and benefit.
"This is about the sanctity of human life, and respect for human dignity."
So we cannot sidestep that as we talk about policy.
"Otherwise, [we entrenching ?] a very fundamental core of our value a value of extending liberty and freedom to all of us."
"What we're talking about is a treatment that is medically necessary, as determined by the American Medical Association."
So I'd like to tell you what I believe this issue is really about.
"It's about the American value of equality, and so I say let's live the values of our Constitution: equal treatment under the law."
And I thank the mayor and the council for your support of this issue.
"The American Medical Association to me, for me, has resolved the question by deeming this a medically necessary procedure."
"Uh, based on the briefings I've received,"
"I've also concluded that surgery is not optional, it is actually an appropriate treatment."
"This is a small price to pay for fundamental,uh, helping people to lead happy lives."
We heard several testimony about suicidal considerations.
And I think it's time to end that and to provide the means necessary for people to become the gender they truly believe they are.
When people present me with facts and figures it doesn't override what my heart tells me is the right thing to do.
"And I could not in good conscience allow this city's police officer's to go without health coverage, and I don't feel any different about this issue today."
What was mentioned in testimony is that the suicide rate for transgender people is 33%.
"It seems to me that $32,000 is pretty, um, cost efficient in saving a life."
"And more than that, it's the right thing to do."
"Well I want to thank, uh, Clay Neale [sp?], uh, Jennifer Yoakum [sp?], and Warren Jimenez [sp?]"
Amy Ries [sp?] and Karen Burkes [sp?] on my staff who have all worked on uh this issue over the past 2 1/2 years.
"Again, to our community partner Basic Rights Oregon, to the trans community of Portland who uh each and every day make this city a better place, and it's really my honour and privilege to serve on a City Council where we can bring an ounce of fairness, uh, in return."
"Um, when I put down this gavel, you can clap and cheer."
And the real idea is that the fun of this is that it reaches as many students as possible.
"So, when I'm on my deathbed, it would be nice... you know in the for-profit realm a big success would have been IPO or you get acquired."
But here the big success is you can reach millions and millions of kids.
It's pretty exciting.
Tom:
What's the appetite for learning that you're finding from this generation?
"Especially in the difficult sciences like Math, because we know that we're behind in this country."
Sal:
"You know, the really surprising thing is... is my cousins were fairly motivated students, they were having trouble but I was helping them."
"And when I made the videos, I assumed that they would be.. that the appeal would be for people like my cousins or maybe people like myself.."
"I was a pretty good student when I was in middle school, and all the rest."
But the really big surprise: the letters I get are from students who a lot of us would have traditionally labeled as the disengaged students.
The students who said:
"""I was about to fail out of Algebra..."
"I was about to drop out of High School... until I found this type of a resource""."
"And the big message to me is that it's actually a much larger group of students who really, really want to learn and you just have to give them an outlet, so they're not frustrated, so they don't feel that they're being talked down to."
"And if you give them that, it's not just the 5-10% students that want to learn, it's the 90-95%."
Tom:
"Sal, in proceeding panels, as you know, we talked a lot about poverty, socio-economic depravation, people not having access to the internet."
"So are you talking affectively to those who are privileged or, if not elite class, than certainly in the middle to upper middle class?"
Sal:
"You know, across the board, we've seen..."
"Clearly I think the main barrier here is that there is some type of internet connectivity that someone needs to do, but people are already taking our videos, they are being translated into 11 languages, they're putting them onto DVDs."
I've gotten pictures of people using them in rural Africa and rural India.
"So even now, it can be accessed by people anywhere."
"And as we go forward, the cost of technology is just getting cheaper and cheaper and I think that there is some healthy skepticism around technology in the classroom or technology for learning."
And I think the reason that I solved these is because it was nothing to do with technology.
And we're hoping that between our videos - we then we have a huge software platform - to give exercises and feedback to students - that that will be a catalyst to really use technology.
Tom:
What's the difference between teaching online and teaching in the classroom?
Sal:
The classroom management is a little bit easier.
"So this is what we called earlier R1 and we called this earlier R2, it is the distance to that point very far away."
If I want to know what R2
- R1 is that's very easy now.
I draw a line from here perpendicular to this line and you see immediately that this distance here is R2 - R1.
"But that distance is also -- you realize that this angle is theta -- it's the same one as that one, so that distance here is also D sine theta."
"And so now I'm in business, I can predict in what directions we will see constructive interference."
"Because all we are demanding now, requesting, that R2 - R1 is N times lambda."
"And so we need that D sine theta and I'll give it a subindex N, as in Nancy, equals N times lambda."
In others words that the sine of theta N is simply N lambda divided by D.
"And that uniquely defines all those directions, the whole zoo of directions N equals 0, that is the center"
"line, N equals 1, N equals 2,"
"N equals 3, and so on."
And then I have the whole family of destructive interference.
Which would require that lambda
R2 - R1 which is D sine theta must now be 2N +1 times lambda/2.
Just as we had it on the blackboard there.
We discussed that earlier.
And so that requires then that the sine of theta N for the destructive interference is going to be 2N+1 times lambda / 2D.
So this indicates the directions where we expect maxima and where we expect minima as seen from the center between the two sources.
But now I would like to know what the linear distance is if I project this onto a screen which is very far away.
"And so let us have a screen at a distance capital L which has to be very far away, so here are now the two sources."
It's a different scale.
And here is a screen.
And the distance b- from the two sources to the screen is capital L. And here is one of those direction theta.
And you see immediately that if
"I call this the direction X, X being 0 here, that the tangent of theta is X/L."
"If but only if I deal with small angles, the tangent of theta is the same as the sine of theta."
"And therefore I can now tell you where the maxima will lie on that screen, away from the center line, which I call 0, that is now when X of N is L times the sine of theta, in small angle approximation."
"So this is approximately L times N lambda divided by D, and for the same reason you will get here c- destructive interference when X of N is going to be L times 2N+ 1 times lambda / 2D."
That is simple geometry.
So now we have all the ingredients here on the blackboard and I'm going to
leave it there for the rest of the lecture.
What about the people who eat it in their fish?
What are the public health costs?
"You know, all these costs."
"I mean, we're talking millions and millions and millions of dollars."
"So you want to make waste management, or you want to do waste reduction?"
"Which one is more cost efficient, cost effective?"
"For a government that's struggling, that can't even provide water to the residents in"
"Denpasar, there are so many other crises that are impending on this island, you know, plastic should be the easiest thing."
"Just put a bag tax, and then when people already realize, there's already public support, ""hey, bags are expensive,"" then you do a bag ban."
Ban it.
Ban the single use plastic bag.
Ireland?
92% reduction in 2 weeks!!!
"They just banned it outright, and it's possible in a place like Bali: it's an island."
You could just ban the bag.
And people would just have to learn to deal with it.
You learn.
"The first or second time you go to the store and you don't have a bag, and you're either forced to buy a bag or you've got to go home and get one, you won't forget again."
"You know, instant behavior shift."
Instant.
"And people will grumble, and [complain], but grow up!"
"We have to be adults about the environment we live in. / Students are the next leaders to come in the very near future, so they need to be able to have access to the kind of information and education to be made aware."
"And often times, not just in Indonesia, but in many countries, the school curriculum is outdated."
"It's not relevant to the current issues that we're facing in modern times, so to be able to infuse the perhaps outdated or ""has-room-to-grow"" curriculum, we feel that would be really effective, and get the kids excited."
"We started to select schools in different areas, many of them were in a little bit more remote areas, where they didn't really have any collection service, so typically the school would be burning the waste, or throwing it in the river at the back."
"We had very good discussions in a high school, in which, without wanting to say what was the solution, we were asking,"
"""What do you think should be done, what can you do to reduce waste in your daily situation?"""
"And without having to say anything, because we had refreshments around that were served by the school, students went straight away,"
"""This can take away, this we can reintroduce the banana leaf, don't use that and that."""
"So, I think actually the high schools should be a pretty good target. / A lot of programs, they don't need a lot of money, but they need some."
"And if you could help in the fundraising efforts for getting these programs off the ground or sustaining them, it would be a huge, huge help."
"When you think about it on that global scale, what will future communities do?"
It's just part of life.
"It's just your reality at this moment, don't take it personally, as an affront to your arrogant idea of who you think you are."
"When you accept it, you start to undermine it."
"It's a wonderful thing to know that when you're at peace with fear, fear dissipates."
"When you're not angry at anger, the anger just loses its power source, it just dissipates."
"When you're just at peace or accept the grief, the grief doesn't last very long."
It's when we try and control these things and get rid of them that we're actually feeding them.
So we let go of this controller.
"We're kind to our emotions, even our negative emotions."
"So when you have, you know a negative emotion, you're disappointed, you're fed up, look at those emotions like beings in this world, be compassionate to the beings which exist in your mental landscape."
"And we should never be cruel, we should be gentle to ourselves and allow these things to be.."
"Because too often we do violence to our emotional world, and because we do violence to our emotional world, it's against the gentleness of this second factor of the eightfold path."
"Because we do violence to that world - ""I shouldn't be afraid!"
I shouldn't be grieving!
"I shouldn't be angry!"" you can see that that makes more negative emotions for your future."
Basically we call this the Law of Kamma.
The emotions you have now have been generated by what you've done in the past.
But they're there - you can't undo the past.
"You're stuck with this, the results of your past kamma."
"I don't mean past life - I mean what you've been doing today, it's created this moment you're feeling now."
But now what are we going to do about this.
"It's the kamma we do in the moment which is most important and if we face this moment, maybe a moment of grief, it may be a moment of fear, it may be a moment of sadness, a moment of anger, we can face this moment and say ""This is a result of past kamma, what am I doing about this now?"
I'm going to make good kamma with this feeling.
I'm going to let go of trying to control it.
I'm going to be kind to it.
I'm going to be gentle with it.
I'm going to respect it.
Allowing it like every other being in this universe to be - they have a reason to be here.
"I'm going to allow them to be and accept them and be at peace with them."""
"When you can make peace and be kind to the emotions you're experiencing in the moment, a wonderful thing happens - the emotional pain loses its sting, and the tightness of that emotional knot starts to unravel."
"Whether it's a broken heart, or whether it's grief over the loss of a child, when you really let it be, we call it healing."
We call it sort-of fixing up the problem.
"And it's the expected value of e, to the s transpose x."
"Okay, and this is equal to e to the s, transpose mu, plus a half s transpose sigma s."
"Now, you're probably familiar with this in the 1 dimensional case, we'll just recover here."
"Suppose x is really just a scale of random variable, then the moment generating function of x is equal to the expected value of e to the sx, and it's equal to e to the s mu plus the half sigma squared s squared."
And this is the case where x is normal with mean mu and variance sigma squared.
So this is the moment generating function of the scalar.
Normal random variable.
"This is, it's generalization to a multivariate normal random vector, x."
Okay.
"So, we call our partition we saw in an earlier module."
We can break x into two blocks of vectors x1 and x2 as such.
"We can extend this notation, notation naturally."
"So we can write Mu equals 1 2, and equals to This sigma 11, sigma 12, sigma 21, sigma 22 and they are the mean vector and covariance matrix of x1, x2."
So we have the following results on the marginal conditional distributions of x.
The marginal distribution of a multivariate normal random variable is itself normal.
In particular the marginal.
Distribution of Xi is multivariate normal with mean vector Ui and variance covariance matrix sigma Ii.
"So for example X1 is multivariate normal, in fact it's k components, mu 1, sigman 1, 1."
And similarly X2 is multivariate normal.
"Mu 2, sigma 2, 2, and this is n minus k components."
"And we have here an example of the bi-variance normal density function, where the correlation beween x1 and x2 is 80%."
If we rotate the service you can see the correlation of 80 percent the large values of X 1 are associated with values of x 2
like all values of x 1 are related to all values of x 2.
So we can also talk about the conditional distribution assuming sigma is positive definite.
The conditional distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is also multivariate normal.
"In particular x 2, given that x 1 equals little x 1 is multivariate normal with mean vector mu 2.1."
"In the variance, covariance matrix, sigma 2.1."
"Where mu 2 1, is given to us by this expression here, and sigma 2.1 is given to us by this expression here."
"And we can get some intuition for this result, by just imaging the following situation; so we've got X one down here."
"We have X two over here, and imagine we plot some points from X one and X two if you like, we generate X one and X two from some distribution, from the bivariate normal distribution, in particular."
"So the mean of X one is, let's say mew one and the mean of X two is mew two."
Okay.
"But if you use a design that other people have tried and you can just get some recommendations, it tends to work better and have less problems."
"So now, we have the don'ts."
"The first don't is, they're very common error, don't store Greywater."
"If you store it, it has nutrients in it, it has, you know, little pieces of gunk and stuff, it will start to break down and it'll basically start to smell very bad."
So you don't ever want to have it in a container and store it for later.
"You also use--make Greywater everyday, so there's no reason, practical reason to store it."
"You don't want to have a filter that you have to actually manually clean because that's just a point of failure, people forget to clean things if you need to have regular maintenance, so that's a not a good idea."
You don't want to use it if you're near a creek or a river.
It has nutrients in it and those nutrients can actually pollute.
It's like a fertilizer.
"So if that gets into the water, it will cause algae to grow and rob the creek or river of oxygen."
So some sites are just not appropriate for Greywater.
And you also don't want to use it if you don't have very good drainage on your site because you never want to have pooling of Greywater or running off.
You need to make sure it can soak properly into the ground to irrigate plants.
And so the next thing: mulch basin.
Who's heard of a mulch basin?
Got one person?
"Yeah, this is kind of a common-ish landscaping technique to be water-conserving."
"It's making, putting mulch around trees."
It lets--so what you do with the mulch basin is you go to the drip line of the tree and you remove some soil kind of like a doughnut ring of soil removed and you fill it up with woodchips instead.
"And this allows--with Greywater when you are going to irrigate with Greywater, it goes into that mulch basin."
It can spread out through all those woodchips.
It gets actually kind of filtered in the woodchips naturally and it soaks down into the ground and you never see it into some pool or run off.
It's just going underground and irrigating.
So it's probably the most important piece of a Greywater
System.
"And it's not often spoken of because it's, you know, out in the landscape."
It's not a pipe; it's not a plumbing part; it's something you do to your landscape.
But it's really important to have a well-functioning Greywater System.
"And so, as that Greywater goes into the landscape, the other really critical thing is something that you don't really see."
It's the billions of microscopic soil bacteria that are in the soil.
"They're consuming nutrients; they're taking any kind of gunky, dirty whatever is in your Greywater and turning it into plant nutrients."
"Literally within the browser, we can have more things going on to benefit you because it's a more powerful platform than any other browser; and I could assess that technically, but the important thing is it really is a much more powerful platform for this new augmented humanity model."
"At the same time, I've not talked about monetization and ads and so forth because I wanted to talk about end-users first."
It's also important that the people in these ecosystems make money.
So an example would be that people have thing--information that they want to sell.
They have advertising they want to show.
"There are many, many examples of this, and we take this very seriously, so obviously our revenue is among other things."
YouTube is a very interesting example of this.
YouTube--and everybody here is using YouTube--YouTube is this amazing global phenomenon now.
It has more than two billion of views per day.
Think about that.
Two billion views of YouTube everyday.
"I mean, think about the amount of time being spent doing this."
"A hundred and sixty million mobile views per day, 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, right?"
You can imagine the quality.
I'll leave that up to you.
"The business is doing very, very well with more than two billion monetized views per week and the number of advertisers, the number of monetized views is up 50% in the"
last year.
"Partners are doing well, our display business, another component of this."
We have more than 300 million visitors per day.
"We have more than--we--the DoubleClick platform, which we acquired awhile ago, serves over 45 billion ads per day, and 94 of the top 100 Ad Age advertisers advertise on the Google display network."
"So, what I wanted to do in a, in a sort of to start was to lay a framework, a model for you of what things are like now."
And what I felt would be fun would be to have some demos of products that are just about to get released and I hope will work in our demo.
The person in-charge of our mobile effort is Hugo Barra.

"Thank you for joining us for Managing Content on Shared Drives, a recorded web seminar delivered by the US National Archives and Records Admministration's"
National Records Management Training Program.
"In this online briefing from August 2012, Beth Cron from the Office of the Chief Records Officer shares tips on managing electronic records and other content on shared drives."
Let's join the seminar.
Paulette Murray:
My name is Paulette Murray and I'm with the National Archives and Records Administration.
I'm very excited to get today's online briefing started.
"Today we will have Beth Cron, and she'll be discussing managing content on shared drives."
These online briefings were created by NARA to present current records management subjects to a widely geographically dispersed audience.
We'd like to thank you for attending today.
This series of online briefings will allow us to maximize our limited government resources.
This briefing will last approximately one hour.
"This hour will include a presentation on the topic for approximately 30 minutes, and then we'll open up for question and answer."
"As your phones are on mute, and if you have called in, please feel free to use the chat box to ask any questions during the presentation or during the question and answer sessions."
"Today's briefing is titled Managing Content on Shared Drives, and we have Beth Cron with us today."
Beth is a member of the Records Management Policy section within the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
"Her team developed the NARA bulletin ""Guidance on Managing Content on Shared Drives"" and it was released in December 2011."
This webinar is based on research and content of this bulletin.
"The Records Management Policy Team has also produced guidance on Web 2.0 and social media records, cloud computing, and e-mail archiving applications."
Check out the Records Express Blog updates for the latest news from the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
And with that said I would like to introduce Beth Cron.
Beth Cron:
"Thank you, Paulette."
Good afternoon and good morning to those of you in other time zones.
I just want to say thank you and welcome to the webinar for today.
First of all I'll provide you a little bit of background on the shared drives bulletin and how it came about.
"Based on feedback that we received from agencies and NARA staff, our management decided that we should develop a bulletin on managing shared drives."
"Through development of the bulletin, we interviewed a number of agencies on the configuration of their shared drives and asked them about any reorganization projects that they've done on their shared drives."
It's a  in German or Northern Germany where there is a wreath of greenery and then typically four candles set in a square fashion around this circular wreath.
And it would sit on the table.
"And so she wanted to make them go sideways, she was drawing a fold out drawing of the wreath and its four candles as her first drawing."
"Um, as an adult."
"So my suggestion to you is, don't think that it is necessary to start at some peculiar place which they must have, like three-dimensional objects, then move to representations of those, like a sculpture, then slip away another dimension and go to ."
Then slip away another dimension and go to two dimensions.
No - just drop them in the deep end and say please draw.
And you'll find they will do lines for surface edges without asking you what can a line stand for. and _.
"And they will start learning shapes that are relevant and they will start using spacial systems that are like sighted children, and then they will themselves mature as they themselves evaluate their own drawings."
"By the way, the box that I was asking her to draw was exactly a _ matte the box that you could fold up and put in my pocket, complicated enough that it would be a challenge for anybody and so it was a nice sort of task: draw a cube, draw a table, draw a glass, draw a hand, draw _ box."
These are examples of things that you can offer people as targets and they will draw them and they will criticize their own drawings and be satisfied with some parts and then drive themselves into more sophisticated drawings.
"Okay, is that enough?"
Constance:
"Okay, I know that there is other questions."
Dr. Kennedy:
"I am happy to stay, love talking about this, love to know your experiences."
Constance:
"Clearly, again another very passionate person with lots of information."
So Dr. Kennedy will be at the back and thank you
Dr. Kennedy:
My pleasure.

"My favourite Prime Minister is this man right here, Winston Churchill,"
"He was an incredible leader for our country, and indeed the whole free world at the most impossibly difficult time."
"Just a few yards away from here is the Cabinet Room, and Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister sat in that Cabinet Room, and decided, with his colleagues, to fight on against Nazi Germany and Hilter, even after France had fallen."
"That was a heroic decision, a right decision, and actually meant the world was saved from Nazi tyranny."
"It was the most important moment in British history, and I think it's because of his courage and guts that we made the right call."
NEWS READER:
"""Behind Winston Churchill we stand united as never before in history."""
"Well, obviously, he came to office in 1940, at a desperately difficult time; France was about to fall, the war was going extraordinarily badly from Britain's point of view, Hitler was rampant across Europe."
"It looked like the end for the free world, the end for Britain, and the end for"
Churchill too.
It's where they combine all of the things that they've learned through this class and doing it for a large cooking group.
"At first they're scared, but generally by the end, and it's all done they're really happy with their results."
"They felt like they've made a good product, they've pleased the people that they have been producing their meal for and they've had fun."
I liked it where it combined everything that they could do in their class and give them some practical experience in what they've learned.

How to Study for an Online Course
"To be successful in any course, you will need to develop good study habits."
"Much like face-to-face courses, one aspect related to studying for an online course is your study environment."
As you discovered earlier in the module each person has their own learning style.
Your learning style should be taken into consideration when selecting your study environment.
"Some individuals need a very quiet place to study to be able to concentrate; others need music, or other sound, in the background."
"Contrary to some people's belief, studying with the TV on is not usually effective."
"Also, your learning style will help you decide if you should study by yourself or in a study group."
"Choose the location where you study carefully, taking into mind that it needs to have good lighting, be at a comfortable temperature, and be free from distractions."
"To study successfully, you must manage your time effectively."
"Make sure to schedule adequate time over the course of the week to watch lecture videos, read course materials, work o"
Good afternoon!

Ok!
"Dear citizens, dear friends, it has been 25 years!"
I was asked why the sudden hype this year when you guys had all along been keeping a low profile.
"Not so! we had on several occasions in the past, marked the event in different ways."
"This year is a special year, we are very happy to see so many of you attending."
It's 25 years passed.
"In 1987, 16 citizens were arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in the first round with 6 more in the second."
"Two more were added in the following year, which makes the total 24, of whom many are still nursing the wounds or have not been able to forget that sudden twist of fate."
Those arrested had different encounters.
"""Beyond the Blue Gate"", a book written by lawyer Teo Soh Lung, has given a more detailed accounts of life in prison."
"Her account was interspersed with sometimes high-handed treatment, sometimes hilarious moments."
Other detainees have also reminisced about their prison ordeals.
"As far as I am concerned, I started off not knowing what the ISD (Internal Security Department) officers wanted from me."
"In this universe of shades it's easy to misinterpret things, easy to distort things and use them in your own benefit."
"And I think it's hard, and a stage is opening up where everything is going to be like that."
"Where there are going to be so many shades in the network that anyone can interpret reality according to their will, because everything will be true, but if that is allowed to happen, truth will be betrayed."
"A stage is opening up in the net where nothing is as it used to be, and political affiliation is not what it used to be, there's no sense in using the same glasses to look."
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me how you organised the coverage, both during the 15M and after 15O (october)."
"From a logistic point of view too, how many people, why, how... because there is one thing that's true, you've produced so much."
"You have so much text many photos, many videos, many everything... tell me how you did it and how you organised it."
JL:
Periodismo Humano is not a live media outlet.
We don't do this often.
"Being constantly in the street sending tweets and social network updates is an exception, when we see that we can offer something that no-one else is offering."
Because there's no sense in doing what the other media corporations are doing.
"Periodismo Humano's specialty is features written with care and dedication, with text, interviews, chronicles."
We don't do live updates.
Actually during the 15M we didn't give live updates.
What we did was a dual velocity journalism.
"On the one hand we were in the street talking about everything that we saw, using Twitter as a public notebook."
When you spend 12 hours in the Puerta del Sol talking about what you're seeing and afterwards you have to write something up at 4 in the morning when you got home.
Because there comes a moment when you have to write at 4 in the morning and... what material can you use?
What inputs do you use to write your feature?
"Well, everything you've tweeted."
"You go over your tweets, you see the sensations you've felt during the day and you decide how to write your chronicle."
And using videos that have been uploaded all day.
"The coverage is done with mobile phones, smartphones, video you can upload via 3G."
They're uploaded straight to our photograph accounts and they're tweeted automatically.
Keeping a video for the day after makes no sense.
You can move it twice.
"First immediately, and afterwards at night in your narrative, inside an article where you're talking about something else."
Lots of people have offered their work to Periodismo Humano from the 15M.
"Many are from Vietnam, the US, the UK, Brussels, from all over Spain."
"We talked about what's happening in Barcelona, but also in Madrid, in Seville, under the aqueduct of Segovia, where there was also a concentration at the beginning."
"""This is unbelievable information."""
"And as I began to move through this,"
I realized that we spend more on healthcare in this country than any other country in the world.
And that disease doesn't know party lines.
Cancer doesn't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat.
We spend 16 cents of every dollar in this country managing disease.
"And as I thought about that, I thought,"
"""None of us can do everything, but all of us can do something."""
"And right now, we've got this prototype, this new technology in our food supply."
"And I thought, it's kind of like the fax machine - you know, maybe it served its purpose there for a while, but the two products that it's brought us have allowed an increased spraying of weedkiller, and for something to produce its own insecticide, and maybe it's time for a new technology."
"Because right now, these farmers, they sign End User Agreements, where they have to license the use of this technology, they're charged royalty fees, trait fees, licensing fees."
I spent time with these guys on their farms - and this is not the farming that their grandfathers did.
"At the same time, the Department of Justice is investigating this stuff because of the monopolistic practices, the way that these seed companies can increase their prices five to ten percent in order to drive shareholder return."
"And while none of us can do everything, all of us can do one thing."
Because each and every single one of us has something that we are uniquely good at.
"And when you leverage that with something that you're passionate about, you can create extraordinary change."
"And as I leaned into this - you know people were trying to call me an activist, and they were trying to call me an advocate - and I just thought none of those terms hit me quite right, because I realized that this was so totally inspired by love."
"And I thought, what do you call people who are working and totally inspired by love to restore the health of our country, and to create a better way?"
"And I realized that our country was founded on that spirit, and that you really simply call us citizens."
"And so I invite you to lend your talents, to find a friend, so that together, we can create the change that we want to see in the health of our families, and the health of our food system, and in the health of our country."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"hehehe, yeah baby ! alright then... what are your thoughts on driving the car? what is your reaction?"
"Very possibly, the fastest car I've ever been in - unbelievable unbelievable - really like a rock, specially that second gear shift it is like the front wheels come off the ground,"
"I think, i'm speechless - it is amazing !"
Not bad for a car that was engineer to try to be efficient - yeah
Yeah - Close the mind !
No reason why efficiency has to be boring.
That much is clear...
Wait!
The crates from the Juarez are in the hold.
We gotta get to a phone.
"In terms of the budget and the Grand Bargain, what we're hearing is the discussion, especially on the Senate side between democrats and republicans, is to do another Grand"
Bargain.
The additional tax increases won't be what you call a big tax increase.
They will go in and change the tax loopholes.
They will eliminate some of the big tax loopholes that benefit some high earners and some big businesses like Exxon and others.
But if they can get the tax code to where it ought to be they will generate probably another $600 million in tax revenues.
And the President started a big bruha amongst the democrats and the republicans last week where he's actually beginning to start talking about cutting some of the entitlement programs.
"We're talking about Medicare, Medicaid, Social"
"Security, beginning to make some cuts on those because so many of the Baby Boomers are retiring and entering into that retirement workforce."
And that is ballooning those costs associated with it.
So that is the deal.
Can you increase the taxes by closing loopholes enough and can you increase revenue enough on the other side to spur economic growth and to rebuild the infrastructure and then keep the country from going into a recession.
We think the politics are excellent in the Senate.
It's hard to say what's going to happen in the House.
But there is some discussion that hopefully some of the regulars of the
"Republican Party will begin to talk with Boehner, can begin to talk with members of the House."
"And it may be a situation where it won't be a majority bill in the house, but if Republicans and Democrats are free to vote on the issues themselves when it comes to the budget there may be enough votes to cobble together some democrats and some republicans to get something passed in a Grand Bargain or in a budget."
"The downside of that is with the Republican Party trending so far to the right now is that most republicans don't necessarily fear a democratic challenger in the next election, but they fear an even more conservative member of the party upending them in a primary."
That's the politics of it.
So we don't know what's going to happen in the House.
I know there is some work going on.
I know the
"President is having these meetings now with republican individuals separately with lunches, dinners, and everything else, and also collectively."
We hope all of that will come to some sort of fruition.
I will speak a little bit more about CSBG after the conclusion of the CSBG presentation.
Brad:
"Great, Arley."
"Thank you very, very much for that overview, and let's turn to Mark Schmeissing who is the NASCSP"
Acting Director for Research for CSBG.
"Mark has been analyzing the numbers for CSBG and it looks like we've got some pretty big challenges on our hands, Mark."
Mark:
"Thanks, Brad."
"I can expect that maybe a lot a lot of this will get better in the future, but as of right now, it's really not the ideal viewing situation for those of us who are trying to engage our audience and trying to, and trying to interact with them and illicit feedback and all that kind of stuff."
I'd love to hear from you guys what you think some of the impact that smart TVs will have on our audience development and the content that we make here on YouTube and all that.
Comment below and let me know!
I'd love to interact and dialogue with you guys there.

I started working with a boy who had just got expelled from school.
He had an interest in computers and at my office I noticed that there was a few lying around that nobody was using.
I got it to this kid and it completely turned things around for him.
Since that time we have been able to help thousands of people.
Eighty percent of the people that get a computer system from us have never had one before.
It's the ability to do a job search.
It's the ability to write a resume.
It's the ability to have access to the internet.
"By donating their equipment, local businesses and individuals get to be a part of that."
So many times a business or organization will spend thousands of dollars to get rid of their computer equipment.
For us we pick it up at no charge.
All those chemicals don't end up polluting the environment and the best part of being it gets to someone whos never had anything.
As this program has evolved we have established relationships with local colleges.
"Its a good learning experience for student interns, and work study students and service learning students."
The mission of PCs for people is pretty simple.
We basically try to help provide some hope and opportunity for people.
I think it is important for people to have the opportunity that everyone else has.
It's the right thing to do.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.
So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place.
It is the tenths place.
So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
Can you get enough players?
Can you get enough of the pieces to go?
"And if you offer a sufficiently compelling value proposition and a real differentiator, these things can grow big very quickly."
"I think the lesson of the Internet is that new businesses can grow very, very quickly when you get just the right combination of things and you get scale. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"And in the mobile internet, we have it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Yeah.
We clearly have had that this year.
"And, by the way, we've been waiting for years, so we've talked about this for a long time."
"So, again, in the â€˜What's New,' I think it's finally there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Who would've thought that the best signet that could've ever happened to the mobile Internet is that the growth was constrained by the carriers in their decks for so long and that it would happen to get traction at the time when the economy was very tough? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"And one of the interesting things about the carriers is the carriers are looking for new sources of data revenue and, you know, you asked earlier about the netbooks?"
"Some of the carriers are saying, ""Well, why don't we subsidize all of these different kinds of devices in the same way that they do with mobile phones today?"" Everybody understands the mobile phone plans, and they're subsidized, and so forth, to get those things out of there."
"And, again, that's another new thing that I think will serve as an accelerant to an already exciting industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Any questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thanks.
Greg sort of crossed specific capital.
Mary mentioned Japan as really leading in the mobile Internet.
And I wanted to understand what you're optimistic about in terms of other countries that are coming along.
Certainly it's not this country.
"But other countries that you think would follow the footsteps of Japan with mobile advertising, other revenue?"
Second question is what is your venture capital and M&amp;amp;A strategy going forward? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"With Japan, we have now partnerships, I think, with two of the three, or the three, depending on exactly how you define the leading mobile providers."
And the monetization is excellent.
"And so when you get it right, when you have the right ad product and the right search product on the right device and, of course, Japan, the products themselves are all different."
"Anyone who has spent their, tried to get your own phone to work on their networks, so we know that as a proof point."
And that's been true for a couple of years.
"So, we're now attempting to replicate those kinds of deals."
The obvious prize will be China because of the simple volume there.
"There's enough growth in CPMs and, basically, application use and wireless data networks in China that that's sort of the next really, really big one."
"The penetration for mobile devices in Europe is very strong, but the economies are not so strong."
We'll wait and see what happens there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
You mentioned-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Essentially, we think that the slow diffusion of computers, which people were predicting should increase productivity as way back as the 1980s, suddenly in the 1990s it really happened."
And this IT revolution led to a big productivity increase.
"It's not clear if that's dying down now again, or if it's going to continue."
It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next 15 years.
"So we have this period of high productivity growth, slowed down from '73 to the early '90s and then picked up again."
"We're not quite clear if that year's coming to an end or not, but that's sort of where we are now in that time path."
"What's very interesting-- so that's what happens to productivity, that's all I'll talk about it for this course, it's more of a macro topic."
But I will mention an interesting micro spin on that.
"Which is, if society's more productive, that's like found money for society."
That's like saying with all our resources we suddenly get extra money.
Society then has to decide what to do with that.
The US and Europe have followed very different paths in what to do with that money.
"In the US, we've taken that money and bought a lot more stuff."
We have the highest standard of living in the world.
We buy the most stuff per capita of anyone the world.
"In Europe, they took a lot of that money and took more"
leisure with it.
"They decided we're not going to quite have as much stuff, but we're going to have six weeks a year of vacation instead of two weeks a year of vacation."
So if we go back to our discussion of what determines
"labor supply is the choice between leisure and consumption, and you think of the wage as the opportunity cost of leisure, well, what they've decided in Europe is to choose more along the leisure axis, and less along the consumption axis."
"In the US, we've chosen less among the leisure axis-- we work way harder than Europe-- but we have more stuff."
"And the question is, how do we feel about that choice?"
Has that been ultimately a welfare maximizing choice?
"Now an economist will say of course it's been, because it's a choice we made."
"Of course, it's been welfare maximizing."
"We talk about revealed preference, and people's choices reveal what they prefer."
"So our revealed preference, we just prefer stuff more and"
leisure less than Europe.
"But in fact, it's not clear that that is each individual's optimal choice."
"If a given individual says, look, I'd rather have less stuff and more time off, it may be hard to find the job that lets them do that."
"So while that may be the choice we've made as a society with our social institutions, that may not serve the interests of every individual in society."
And that's the kind of trade-off we need to think about.
"And that's called an affordance, and that's not just in the real world, but also in the physical world."
All these various widgets have these physical properties that are baked into their visual design.
"When you look at one of these, you can very quickly infer how you are going to interact with it because of those properties."
"The way that the circle's slightly larger makes it seem grabbable, the way that it's brighter on one side implies that it's been sort of filled so it feels like a track that you can grab this thing and move it on."
"Seeing a check box, a square in the presence of one that has a check box, is going to convey that that one could also have a check box."
"On and off, literally writing it on the switch is going more towards the direction of writing your manual on top of it, but the visual design conveys what it does, the same with the button."
So these are all affordances.
"Basically, an affordance is implied physics from the visual appearance."
"Moving on to the third one, natural mapping."
So let's run a quick experiment on the audience.
Say we're looking at a stove.
"So the second dial, which burner does it control?"
"And silence, you don't know, because there's no way to figure it out."
"We could literally write the glyphs on top of it, that would help."
"But the thing is, writing your manual directly on the product is cheating."
Then what if it wears off?
"That's definitely one way of doing it, but it's not a natural mapping."
"A better Ul, and this is something that Alan Cooper"
"likes to talk about, is if the dials were in that same configuration as four things, then it just naturally affords which burner they control."
This is also always true of light switches.
"So light switches only are frustrating when they don't actually map in order to the lights in the room, and if they do map in order, you usually just flip the right one without even thinking about it."
"If they don't, then you start randomly hitting them to try to figure it out and getting frustrated."
So this is a natural mapping.
"Another example, controls in a car."
"I love this one, because it's actually two natural mappings at the same time."
"The first is it's directly below the window, so it's a sort of natural orientation to where the window is, and also the four controls map to the four windows in the car."
"Sometimes, these are placed on the center console, which is really weird."
So that's in the physical world.
"In terms of the virtual world, we have things like this where the Full Screen control has a natural mapping to the window becoming larger."
It's placed on the edge.
It seems to afford expanding.
"In this case, the Account Selector has a mapping to the window, because the account controls the window as a whole, not an individual tab."
"Not just ""kind of"", it's actually joining our ancestor as its being created and extending that relationship by joining with another instance of parent."
So you can kind of think of going down the ancestor tree adding relationships as we go down.
"Again, I really can't encourage you enough to download this query and play with it yourself to fully understand what's going on."
Let's go ahead and run it.
It's going to be rather anticlimatic.
"When we run it we do discover that these five people are Mary's ancestors, and if you've drawn the little tree of the data you can verify that, that's the correct answer."
Let's play around a little bit.
Let me try a few other people's ancestors.
Let's try Frank.
We don't see Frank here because
"Frank actually happens to be a child of Mary's, so we should get even more ancestors when we run this one, especially"
"Mary should be included, and in fact, she is, there she is, and these are Frank's ancestors."
"Let's try George, I think"
George was somewhere in the middle of the tree there.
"Yes, George has three ancestors, and finally let's try Bob."
"Bob is at the root so we should get an empty result and we do, because again Bob has no ancestors in our database."
Now lets take a look at our second example.
"That was the one where we had a hierarchy of management chain in a company, and then we were interested in computing the total salary cost of a project, so I've set up our three tables."
"The first one is the Employee table, it just gives the IDs of the employees and the salary of each employee."
The second table is the Manager relationship.
"So, again, you might want to draw the little tree here although it's pretty simple this time."
"123 is at the root of our little management structure, as 234 as a subordinate."
"234 has two subordinates, 345 and 456 and 345 is another one."
So it's only a three level tree.
Of course if we knew it was only three levels we wouldn't need recursion at all.
But we're going to write a query that will work for arbitrary numbers of levels.
So that's our management structure.
"And finally, our third table, the Project table says that employee 123 is the manager of project X, so what we want to do is find the manager of project"
"Y in the hierarchy,and then take that manager's salary along with the salary's of all the manager's subordinates recursively down to the management structure, and of course that's everybody in in our little database."
"Again, I can't encourage you to download the script and run it for yourself."
So here's our query to find the total salary of project x and I'm actually going to give a couple of different ways of running this for you.
The way we've done it the first time is to effectively expand the management structure into a relation called superior.
"But, in unison, we are celebrating the life of my Dad."
"My first friend, the best man at my wedding, and an individual that set the bar when describing a true ""family man."""
"Being a simple person, it didn't take much to please our Dad"
"After he served 8 years in the U.S. Navy,"
"Dad often wore a hat in public, with an image and the name of battleship on which he served."
"Should someone recognize him as a veteran and thank him for serving,"
Dad would beam with pride.
"The word ""handy"" and our dad, were never used in the same sentence."
"His most exhaustive chore, just might've been re-setting his dozens of clocks, in the spring and fall."
"Yet, incredibly until about the last year of his life, he maintained his tropical fish tanks with meticulous care."
Dad loved to make people laugh.
"Through his timeless and - often repeated - stories, to his quick-witted comments, to his juvenile behavior, intended solely to draw belly laughs from his grandchildren and great-grandchildren that he adored."
Many of you here today experienced those fun-loving times with us while in our Dad's presence.
"And at this point I would be remiss to not formally thank so many people as we close this chapter of our lives that included Dad in our physical presence but, with your help we will continue to re-live so many wonderful memories until the day we are called, and that the faith we hold that our Dad nurtured, we will see him and the other loved ones we lost once again."
"We thank you - his sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters-in-law."
"Nieces, nephews, cousins, former co-workers, family friends, neighbors for all of your comforting words and support."
"Your visits, the food you have prepared for our family."
"We're grateful to have you in our lives, and have you be a part of our Dad's."
"I'd also like to thank Father Steve, for leading our service."
"Outside of perhaps a certain individual who resides at the Vatican,"
I know my dad would prefer no one else presiding here today.
To my sisters...
"Chris, Theresa, Karen and Donna."
Each of you and your own unique ways brought so much happiness into dad's life.
Chris your selfless love and cheery disposition engulfed Dad.
You always made the time for what ever was needed without complaint.
I'm convinced that no one in this world has a bigger heart than you.
"Theresa,"
"My sister with a tough exterior, originating, perhaps, from her delivery by dad in a bar."
"But someone who displays a soft spot at the moments of her choice that is welcome by those, like my parents, on the receiving end."
"On many occasions, even during your own life's challenges"
"Mom and Dad would share stories with me of your visit or phone call and rave how your carefree attitude and laughed would bring cheer to them when, at certain moments, the roles should have been reversed."
I think is a shame.
I would like this to be in the language -- or would have liked it to be in the language -- for two reasons.
One is the loop affordances it provides expect you're always going to exit either at the top or the bottom of the loop.
"I don't know if it's something weird about me, but I tend to exit out of the middle more often than"
I exit out of either end.
[laughter]
You can do that.
"Just say 'while true', which just looks stupid."
This is the more elemental thing.
The other is that it makes it easier to think about the language.
If this were the primitive loop statement and all of the others were simply variations on that then the language in its core would be smaller and easier to reason about.
"So when you're thinking about the language's security, you have less analysis to do."
I think that would be a useful thing.
"For example, we can take a while statement and de-sugar it into a simple loop statement."
You can see by the amount of de-sugaring it does that the while statement really isn't buying us very much.
We can do a similar thing with the do while statement.
"It's sort of interesting: while the 'do while' looks very different than the 'while' statement, what it does is actually almost identical."
The only difference is that it put the test on one end rather than on the other.
"Then when you look at what the 'for' statement actually does, it really doesn't do anything at all."
It just is complicated.
"Another way that you could think about doing iteration, another way of doing a loop, would be to use recursion."
"Another way that we could have transformed the while statement would be to turn it into a function which calls itself, and continues to call itself as long as the condition is true, with two restrictions."
"One is that because of the way functions work in JavaScript, you can't take any arbitrary code and put it inside of a body here."
"Arguments, this, break statements and return statements, the meanings of all of those change when you put them into a function, so you can't put them in the body here."
The other — more important — thing is that JavaScript does not implement tail recursion optimization
-- what people call proper tail calls.
"You can run for a while, and then it's going to start to slow down as it accumulates memory, and eventually it's going to fail."
You don't
like it when programs fail.
"I'm hoping that maybe someday in the distant future JavaScript would be enhanced to allow this, but it doesn't yet."
But that's not the kind of loop that I'm here to talk about tonight.
"I'm here to talk about event loops, because event loops are much more interesting."
"The significance of Assata Shakur being put on the FBl's terrorists list, the first woman ever to be added to the most wanted list?"
LENNOX HlNDS:
"My view on this is that this is a disingenuous act on the part of, driven by the state of New Jersey and particularly the state police."
"As you know, for decades, the state police have wanted and demanded that the Cuban government extradite Assata Shakur to the United States."
There is no extradition policy between Cuba and the United States.
"Just to deal with this in context, the Cuban government, pursuant to international law— that is, particularly the refugee convention— have granted Assata Shakur political asylum."
"Now, what is the basis for that?"
"It is if an individual has a well-grounded fear that if they return to the country from which they left, they would either be persecuted or prosecuted based upon their political beliefs or/and their race or religion."
"Now, this is not a new concept."
"There have been numerous individuals who have left the United States and went to foreign countries, allies of the United States, where those countries have refused to extradite them."
"France, for example, in the 1970s, there were Black Panthers who hijacked planes and went to France."
"Now, both France and the United States have extradition treaties."
"Not only that, France signed the 1963 Tokyo Convention, the 1970 Hague Convention and the 1973 Montreal Convention, with the United States."
"All of these are international agreements that require countries, host countries, that are holding individuals—who have hijacked planes—to extradite them or try them."
"France, after conducting their own independent review of these Black Panthers, refused to extradite them to the United States based upon France's assessment that if they would be returned, they would be subject to political and racial repression."
"So, I say that the Cubans"" position is well grounded in international law."
"Now, why today is Assata Shakur now being branded a terrorist?"
"If we look at the definition of terrorism, what is it?"
It is the use or the threat of use of force against a civilian population to achieve political ends.
What happened in the case of Assata Shakur?
"You have heard, in her own words, this woman was a political activist."
She was targeted by whom?
J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in a program that was called COlNTELPRO.
That program was unveiled by whom?
"Frank Church, Senator Frank Church, in the 1970s."
He chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"That committee determined that the FBI was using both legal, but mostly illegal, methods—to do what?"
"In the FBl's own words, they wanted to discredit, to stop the rise of a black messiah— that was the fear of the FBl— so that there would not be a Mau Mau, in their words, uprising in the United States."
"And they were, of course, referring to the liberation movement that occurred in Kenya, Africa."
"Now, the FBI carried out a campaign targeting not only the Black Panther Party."
They targeted SCLC.
They targeted Martin Luther King.
"We'll talk about one later on that is, does have weight gain."
"But Paroxetine, of the SSRls, is probably your highest risk adding maybe about five pounds, to ten pounds."
"Sertraline, or Zoloft, is used at a dose anywhere from 50-200mg."
"Again, various indications."
"Some of the unique aspects of this are it can be a little more activating; we have some actual slight dopamine activity, so that can give a little bit of activation."
Dopamine often functions very similarly to norepinephrine.
"It can be helpful in an actual atypical depression, which we're not really focusing on during this talk, but those patients, that subset, that sleep more and eat more."
"We do see quite a bit of diarrhea and sweating with this clinically, so you have to be careful with initiation too, with patients."
"And then, again, you have to taper this medication."
"Pretty much every antidepressant, except for Prozac or Fluoxetine, you have to taper."
"Fluoxetine, with that long half-life, tapers itself."
"Citalopram, or Celexa, is actually, when looking at the pictures, probably the clean SSRI that we think of."
All it really touches is Serotonin.
"There's a little, little bit of antihistamine activity, so sedation is about 50/50 with this drug."
So half the patients say if they take it in the morning they're tired in the afternoon.
"Half of them, it doesn't make any difference."
"If they're taking the medicine in the morning, and really tired in the afternoon, they can switch it, potentially, to bedtime to help with that."
There's really no drug interactions.
"There's an advantage in the elderly with this, because it's a very clean, useful drug."
It does have two sides to it: it's broken down.
And so it has an inactive side in terms of when the liver metabolizes it.
And that becomes important because it leads into the next drug we're going to talk about.
"So, we're going to kind of transition into Citalopram to Escitalopram."
"And you see, Citalopram on the top has R and S enantiomers."
"And the liver metabolizes this drug into two components: an ""R"" enantiomer - which basically, think about this, is the liver makes active and inactive drug."
And the active drug is something called Escitalopram or Lexapro.
And so these two are really what we often refer to as cousins.
They're very similar medications.
"So, when looking at Escitalopram versus Citalopram, again, you see a little bit different dosage with the Lexapro in that we can kind of get a little bit lower dosage because, you see, it's about 100 times more potent than Citalopram."
"Meaning that it's not necessarily more effective; it's just occupying all receptors with active drugs, versus some receptors with inactive drug."
Some of the studies suggest that 10mg of Lexapro is about equivalent to 20-40mg of Citalopram.
"This can be an insurance issue, though."
And yet all the silver in the mines of Potosi couldn't help the inexorable economic and political decline of Spain's empire.
Why was that when Pizarro seemed to have struck it so incredibly rich?
The answer is that the Spaniards had dug up so much silver to finance their wars of conquest that the metal itself suffered an extraordinary decline in value.
More silver coins didn't make Spain richer.
They simply made prices higher as an increased quantity of money chased the same amount of goods.
What the Spaniards didn't get was that money is only worth what other people will give in exchange for it.
"And whether money takes the form of silver coins, sea shells, bars of gold, or bank notes, that's been true from Ancient times right down to the present day."
Even lumps of clay can work better than silver coins if people have enough confidence in them.
"In Ancient Mesopotamia, nearly 4 000 years ago, people used clay tablets, like these ones, to commit themselves to particular financial transactions."
"For example, this one, found a little southwest of Baghdad, specifies that a debtor will repay a lender 330 measures of grain on the harvest day."
But this one's even more fascinating because what it says is that a debt of 4 measures of barley should be repaid to the bearer of the clay tablet.
And it's that idea of repayment to the bearer that really fascinates me.
"If the phrase sounds familiar, then it should."
Just take a look at the 20 pound note.
Bank notes have next to no intrinsic worth.
"They're simply promises to pay just like the clay tablets of Ancient Babylon, 4 millennia ago."
"On the back of the 10 dollar bill, it says ""In God We Trust""."
But it's not really God you're trusting in.
"By swapping your goods or your labour for a fistful of these things, you're trusting the U.S. Treasury Secretary not to repeat Spain's mistake and produce so many of the damn things that by the time you come to spend them, they're worth even less than the paper they're printed on."
"Today, we're quite happy with paper money."
"Even more amazingly, we're happy with money we can't even see."
Millions of dollars pass through this woman's hands every day.
"Or rather, across her computer screen."
"She's a foreign exchange dealer, whose business is literally buying and selling money."
"Each day, around $3 trillion changes hands in transaction like these around the world."
And it's all built on trust.
It has to be when you can't even touch the stuff.
That's what the Conquistadors got wrong.
"They failed to see that money is about trust, even faith; trust in the person paying you the money; trust in the central bank issuing the money; trust in commercial bank that honours the cheque."
Money isn't metal.
It's trust inscribed.
"And it doesn't much matter what it's inscribed on-- paper, silver, clay, or a screen-- provided the recipient believes in it."
First of all the equality relation must be reflexive.
"This means that the relation holds of every term in the language for itself for all x, x = x."
Relation must also be symmetric.
"If two terms refer to the same thing, it does not matter which one we write in the equation, for all x is equals y implies y=x."
Finally the relation must be transitive.
If we believe that a = b refer to the same object and we believe that b and c refer to the same object then a and c must refer to the same object as well.
Let's see how we can use these properties to solve some problems of equality.
Suppose we know that b = a and we know that b = c.
Let's prove that a = c as well.
As usual we start our proof with our premises.
B = a and b = c.
We add our axioms for equality First reflexivity then symmetry and then transitivity.
Now we go to work on the proof.
"First, we use two applications of universal elimination on our symmetry axiom to derive the fact that b = a implies a = b."
I'm substituting b for x and a for y.
We then use implication elimination on line six and line one to produce a=b.
"We then use universal elimination again to instantiate the transitivity axiom this time with x replaced by a, y replaced by b and z replaced by c."
We can join the result on
"line seven with the premise on line two to, to derive the conjunction on line nine."
And finally we use implication elimination to derive our overall conclusion so it works as expected though it's a bit lengthy.
We'll see a so much faster way to solve problems like this in j ust a short while.
"This exercise test, of understanding of equality by asking you to prove the results, using the basic equality axioms."
"Let's have the vector valued function r of s and t is equal to-- well, x is going to be a function of s and t."
"So we'll just write it as x of s and t times the x unit vector, or i, plus y of s and t times the y unit factor, or j, plus x of s and t times the z unit vector, k."
"So given that we have this vector valued function, let's define or let's think about what it means to take the partial derivative of this vector valued function with respect to one of the parameters, s or t."
"I think it's going to be pretty natural, nothing completely bizarre here."
"We've taken partial derivatives of non-vector valued functions before, where we only vary one of the variables."
We only take it with respect to one variable.
You hold the other one constant.
We're going to do the exact same thing here.
And we've taken regular derivatives of vector valued functions.
"It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own... over to camera 2...Hi there, camera 2, it's me, John Green,"
let's start with that double cheeseburger.
"Oh, food photography, so this contains 490 calories."
"To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed, raise and slaughter cows then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination."
You also have to grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elisabeth I. Then you have to milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
"That's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening of tomatoes and the grinding of mustard seeds, etc."
How in the sweet name of everything holy have we ever come to live in a world where such a thing can even be created.
"And how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US, I can earn it in 11 minutes!"
"And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of relative abundance."
"Well, to answer that question, we are not going to be able to"
"look strictly at history, because there isn't a written record about a lot of these things."
"But thanks to archaeology and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"So 15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters."
"Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses."
"Hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet, as long you could find something with meat to kill."
By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world incidentally was fishing.
"Which is one of the reasons why when you look at the history of people populating the planet, we tended to run for the shore and stay there."
"Marine life was A, abundant, and B, relatively unlikely to eat you."
"While we tend to think the lives of the foragers were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence suggests that they actually had it pretty god."
Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists.
And anthropologists who studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually they spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us.
"And they spend more time on art, music and storytelling."
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology
"""Nisa"", they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping."
What?
I call it skoodilypooping.
I am not going to apologize.
It's worth noting that the cultivation of crops seems to have risen independently over the course of millenia.
"And the number of places, from Africa, to China, to the Americas, using crops that naturally grew nearby."
"Rise in Southeast Asia, maize in Mexico, potatoes in the Andes, wheat in the fertile crescent, yams in West Africa."
People around the world began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
But that's going to be ok because I'm not going to be a moving target.
I'm going to rest my hand on top of my hand to go into my patient.
"So that's ok, there's no way I'm going to stick myself here."
I'm not moving toward my hand.
"So with a 90 degree angle, a nice smooth motion I'm going to inject the medicine the length of the needle into the patient's muscle."
Move my nondominant hand to hold the barrel of the syringe.
Aspirate by pulling back up on the plunger.
Check for blood return.
No blood return.
Administer my medication slowly.
"I draw my needle and I can message it a little bit here, ok?"
This needle is now dirty; it is not recapped.
Toss it in your patient's sharps box.
Ok.
So then I would reposition my patient and do my documentation.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In this module we're going to introduce Martingales.
Martingales play a very important role in finance.
"They won't play a hugely important role in this course, but they will crop up now and again and it's worthwhile understanding what they are and seeing one or two examples of Martingales."
"We're going to have the following definition of a Martingale, a random process, Xn is a martingale, with respect to the information filtration Fn and probability distribution P, if these two conditions are satisfied."
The first condition is just a technical integrability condition which states that the expected value of the absolute value of Xn must be finite for all n.
"The really important condition, is condition two here, which states that the expected value of Xn plus m, given Fn, is equal to Xn for all nm greater than or equal to 0."
A quick comment on what I mean by information filtration.
"So the information filtration, Fn, is just a complicated way of recognizing the information we have at time n."
So Fn will denote all of the information in our model that we know at time n.
"So usually, you will actually, it'd be the case that Fn is equal to the information given to you by X1 up to Xn."
"So basically, it's just recognizing that at time n, we've already seen the values"
X1 up to Xn.
"Returning to condition two here, we see that what this is really saying, is that the expected value of X, at any time in the future, is equal to its current value today."
"And so, Martingales have often been used to, to model what are called fair games, they've got a rich history in gambling, for example."
"Because this condition here, models the idea of a fair game, so your future pay-off, or your expected future pay-off, is equal to your current wealth today, Xm."
"We define a sub martingale, by replacing condition two with a greater than or equal to sign, And we define a super martingale by replacing condition two with a less than or equal to sign."
A martingale then is both a sub martingale and a super martingale.
Going perpendicular to the blackboard right through the middle.
The different R2 - R1 equals lambda would again give me constructive interference.
"That would be a hyperbola then, R2 - R1 equals"
"lambda, that would again be a maximum, and you can draw the same line on this side, and then R2 - R1 being 2 lambda again would be a maximum."
"And again, if this is three-dimensional, you can rotate it about this line and you get bowls."
"And so in between you're obviously going to get the minima, the destructive interference,"
"lambda divided by two, and then here you would have R2"
- R1 is 3/2 lambda.
"We call these lines where you kill each other, destructive interference, we call them nodal lines or in case you have a surface it's a nodal surface."
"And the maxima are sometimes also called antinodes, but I may also refer to them simply as maxima."
And so this is what we call an interference pattern.
"If you look right here between -- on the line between the two points, then you should be able to convince yourself that the linear separation here between two"
lines of maxima is one-half lambda.
Figure that out at home.
That's very easy.
Also the distance between these two yellow lines here right in between is one-half lambda.
And so that tells you then that the number of lines or surfaces which are maxima is very roughly 2D divided by one-half lambda.
"So this is the number of maxima, which is also the same roughly as the number of minima, is then approximately 2D divided by lambda."
"And so if you want more maxima, if you want more of these surfaces, you have a choice, you can make D larger or you can make the wavelength shorter."
"And if you make the wavelength shorter you can do that by increasing the frequency, if you had that control."
The first thing that I'm going to do is to make you see these nodal lines with a demonstration of water.
"We have here two sources that we can tap on the water and the distance between those two tappers, D, is 10 centimeters, so we're talking about water here."
"Uh, we will tap with a frequency of about 7 hertz and what you're going to see are very clear nodal lines, this is a two-dimensional surface, where the water doesn't move at all."
The mountains and the valleys arrive at the same time.
The water is never moving at all.
So let me make sure that you can see that well.
And so I have to change my -- my lights.
"I'll first turn it on, that may be the easiest."
Starts tapping already.
I can see the nodal lines very well.
So here you see the two tappers and here you see a line whereby the water is not moving at all.
At all moments in time it's standing still.
"The question would be well, ya why is it, why are these negative instance such a big deal."
Why can't we just reduce shortest path competition with negative edge links to the problem of computing shortest paths with non negative edge links.
Right so whatever just clear things out we just add big number to all the edges that makes them all non-negative and now we just run Dijkstra's algorithm and we're good to go.
"So this is exactly the sort of question you should be looking to ask, if, as a computer scientist, as a serious programmer."
When confronted with a problem you always want to look for ways to reduce it to simpler problems that you already know how to solve.
And this is a very natural idea of how to reduce a seemingly harder sort of path problem to one we already know how to solve using dutch [inaudible] algorithm.
The only problem is it doesn't quite work.
One isn't gonna work.
"Well if you, Let's say you have a graph, and the most negative edge is -ten."
So all the edge lengths are negative ten and above.
"So then what you'd want to do is add ten to every single edge in the network, and that insures that all of the edge lengths are non negative, run Dijkstra's algorithm, get your shortest path."
The is sue is that different.
Paths between a common origin and destination have differing numbers of edges.
"So some might have five edges, Some might have two edges."
Now if you add ten to every single edge in the graph you're going to change path lengths by different amounts.
"If a path has five edges, it's going to go up by 50, when you add ten to every edge."
"If a path has only two edges, It's only going to go up by twenty, when you add ten to every edge."
"So as soon as you start changing the path lengths of different paths by different amounts, you might actually screw up which path is the shortest."
The path which is shortest under the new edge lengths need not be the one that's shortest under the old edge
lengths.
So that's why this reduction doesn't work.
"To be concrete, let's look at this very simple three vertex graph with vertices s, v, and t and edge lengths as shown."
One minus five and minus two.
"Now what I hope is clear, is that in this graph."
The shortest path.
"The one with the minimum length is the two hot path Svt,"
That has length minus four.
The direct STR has length minus two which is bigger than minus four.
So the upper path is the shortest path.
"Now, suppose we tried to massage this by adding a constant to every edge so all edge lengths were non-negative."
We'd have to add five to every edge because that's the biggest negative number the VT edge.
So that would give us new edge lengths of six.
"So as product designers, we always have to be asking this question, what associations are people going to make from what they're looking at here?"
"Sometimes it seems absurd looking at a simple web form thinking, what associations are people going to make with this thing?"
What does this look like?
"So in these design processes, this is one exercise that we do, and I would highly recommend it."
It's not hard to get started.
"Just pull up a whole bunch of imagery and start sorting out on the table, start making these associations."
What should our product feel like?
What does our product feel like right now?
What do our competitors' products feel like?
What associations do we need to evoke in the minds of our users?
So now we're talking about how to make people care.
"There's one last idea I want to put out there, that one of the best ways to make people care about our products is to show people that we care about our products."
"Now, this is a reality about perception that's hard wired into our brains that sometimes very small things can make a really big difference in how we see something."
"Now, I don't know whether, if I download an app that has a poorly-executed app icon, whether it's going to be more flaky or whether it's going to crash on me."
I haven't necessarily seen the data with that correlation.
But I do know that that's the association that users are going to make based on millions of years of evolution.
"When you see something that's not quite the right color or that has a hole in the wrong place, you bite that fruit, you might be seeing the second half of a worm."
"So also, we need to do not miss the opportunities to do the things that we don't have to."
"Those little pieces of design in places where they're not needed, where they're uncalled for, tell the user that hey, a designer was here."
Somebody thought about this.
They're like little love notes for our users.
"It's the interactive doodle on the home page, or the mint on the pillow, what you put on the back of the box in the package."
It's the hidden extra level of the game.
"There's value in doing these things that don't have an apparent commercial purpose, where we're showing people that we care so they'll care enough to use our products."
"In this case, PacMan didn't help people to finish their searches faster."
"It probably actually got in the way for some people, me included."
"But people loved it, and why?"
Because we didn't have to do it.
It's like a note or flowers.
It's these intangibles that show people that we care.
"Here's another small example that comes from Google Now, where the Context Header changes based on your time of day or your location."
"And when we were making these, during the process people said, this is going to be hard."
Computers allowed us to generate digital contents.
Internet has allowed us to share those contents.
Nowadays more than ever before we have access to tools that allow us to understand our reality and to transform it.
"By backing this project you will collaborate to make ""smart cities"" being produced by smart citizens."
"Hello, my name is Martin Hausenblas and I'd like to thank you."
"By now there are more than 45,000 marketers in more than 170 countries worldwide."
"Thanks to your hard work, taxi drivers and passengers have also begun registering."
The highest priority now is to launch Liftago in the first 4 markets:
"Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania."
"The better we launch in these markets, the easier and faster the launch will be in the markets that follow."
Today I'd like to answer some of your questions and also show you the Liftago Taxi app for the first time!
"Before I start, I'd like to point out that the key to success is the understanding of our product and the way we do business."
That's why I'd like to ask you to carefully go over the materials we provide in our newsletters and on our website.
"If you haven't taken a look at them yet, please do so now."
Now to address your questions.
When is the launch of the Liftago service?
"We are launching the service in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania in June."
We'll keep you updated about the launch timing for the next markets.
Our aim was to launch the service a couple of weeks ago.
"Unfortunately though, software development is not as predictable as we'd like it to be, especially when developing such an innovative service as Liftago Taxi, together with our Liftago Community Business."
Currently we have been field-testing the apps and there's still some fine-tuning of features ahead of us before we can launch the service.
What happens after the launch of Liftago Taxi?
"First of all, we'll celebrate!"
"More importantly, the true work will begin."
"We'll launch the full version of the Liftago website for passengers, drivers, and marketers."
We'll launch the apps and send a download link for Google Play or the App Store with your invite code to all of your pre-registered members.
How do we know that a new member belongs to your community?
The key to that is in the invite code.
You've already been using your invite code to register new marketers or to pre-register new taxi drivers and passengers.
"If you don't know how to use it, take a look at our materials on our website."
"After the launch, share your invite link through www.liftago.com, and also directly from the Liftago apps in various forms, such as QR code, sms, e-mail, or social media."
"Users can install our apps also without the invite code, but it will be much easier for them to simply click on your invite link."
"So because you can't control the people, you feel like well, I'll spend more attention on the things that I can control, the execution time, the amount of storage being used, if it's crashing or not, if it's reproducible."
"And it's not entirely true that people aren't controllable because really, what we're fundamentally dealing with is two information processing machines."
"And that's of course, the CPU and the brain."
"And in some ways, they're very similar, they're both doing computation, one parallel processing, the other one massively parallel."
"One's base2, the other one's based on action potential, so you have dramatically more computational power."
But where they start to be different is we know exactly how computers work.
"We can go back and talk to a lot of people that were kind of instrumental in the field, it hasn't been that long."
"So computer scientists, there's things they're still discovering about how to make things efficient, but it's not"
like there's any part of the machine we don't understand yet.
"Whereas if you talk to someone doing neuroscience or cognitive science, you say, how does the brain work?"
"They have to kind of shrug and say, we're still trying to figure that out."
And that's OK.
We don't have to have a complete knowledge of how the brain works to still have predictable results.
There's enough that we understand about it that we can rely on to get those predictable results.
"So for the purpose of this talk, it's really kind of dehumanizing where we're going to treat people like information processing machines."
"You might think, well no, I'm a special snowflake."
"And yes, you are."
"But you're also, for the purpose of this talk, a uniform snow processing machine."
So three aspects of a great interface.
"First, it needs to be self-describing."
"Secondly, you need to prevent errors, and then third, make users fast."
So we're going to dive into each of these.
"So starting out, self-describing."
"The first thing I want to talk about is this notion of mental model, and a mental model is basically a simulation of reality inside of your mind."
"So to pose a question, how many instances of this talk are happening right now?"
"And of course, the answer is one."
It's right there.
The photons are bouncing off the screen at you.
"And when you're in a big room, you've got the talk there, and that's reality."
"But then on another side, you have the fact that everyone is interpreting the talk in a simulation of the room inside their own head."
"So you have all these simulations going on, and these are the mental models they're building of the reality around them."
"So this is very sort of dystopian movie, maybe we're all in our little pods and we don't know it."
"Yeah, but this was not just any frog."
"Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus."
"In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles, and in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs, and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart."
"It has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs."
"Now, when biologists saw this, they were agog."
"They thought, this is incredible."
"No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this, to change one organ in the body into another."
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
"If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?"
"Now, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut."
"And just as everybody got excited about it, bang!"
It was extinct.
"I called up my friend,"
Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
"He was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab."
"And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --"" This was 30 or 40 years ago."
"""By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"""
"And he thought about it, and he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade, and he poured through everything in the freezer, and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs."
"This was very exciting, but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen."
"And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell."
"If you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls."
"Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope."
It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact.
"So we thought, let's give it a go."
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
"We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg."
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
"Now, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,"
"like what produced Dolly, but it's actually very different, because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells."
"That was a miracle, but it was workable."
"Then, it is simply a question of, are your risky or you're unrisky? it's more complex than that."
"So, as an example of risk and risk perception and acceptance we can take a look at Facebook. this was a firm started by a college student in the U.S. in 2004 that was based initially on an idea that he had in high school. he'd launched this social networking platform at Harvard."
"Within two weeks, had half the student body signed up."
Quickly grew that to 30 other colleges in the region.
Moved to Silicon Valley.
"Partnered with Sean Parker of Napster, and really began to grow in scale the firm."
"They were able to go out and successfully raise some venture capital in the context of, initially,"
Angel Investment.
"And then later, larger traditional VC funding at evaluation of $100 million shortly after the firm was launched."
"So, very rapid growth."
"They continued to grow the firm and expanded it into serving high school students, and expanded their feature side as well of photo sharing."
"They then raised significant rounds of funding thereafter, and had a much greater val uation."
"Shortly before this, the firm was viewed as being worth $100 million based on future profit potential, and now they are over $500 million."
"And they were supporting anyone with an email account, and so they have grown from the college niche to high school, to now anyone that wanted to be a member."
"They then were offered a $750 million to be acquired, to be bought, to be owned by Viacom, and Mark"
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"Earlier that summer, they had a $one billion."
"Shortly thereafter, Viacom attempted to acquire the company for 750 million."
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"A few months later, a billion dollar offer, declined."
"The following year, Microsoft $240 million investment for 1.6% of the company making Facebook worth $fifteen billion based on that investment."
"500 million members signed, and one billion in revenue achieved."
And all of that happened in a span of approximately six years.
"So, in that way, what we see is rapid growth and to grow the company at such a high scale. there were multiple opportunities to be bought and to be acquired that were turned down, and the expectation of the Facebook team is that there were greater upside ahead."
"So, with that, when we look at risk it's easy to be risky when the stakes are low."
"But, when you are working in a high stake situation, we want to think about, well, again what are we risking?"
Is it financial?
Is it safety?
Is it ethics? so all of these certainly play a role.
"Within entrepreneurs, there's not an element of, again, seeking risk but it's more about perception and capability and what they see as a relative return."
"So, when we look at entrepreneurial motivation this is certainly central to understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions and how they perceive risk."
And there are three factors involved with that.
"This is what white light would have done, this is a two-slit interference pattern."
This is what red light would have done.
"Red light is a narrow bandwidth of wavelengths, well-defined black lines, light plus light give darkness, well-defined maxima, and the blue -- notice that the separation between the dark lines and therefore also the separation between the bright lines is substantially smaller."
Because blue light has a wavelength of about 4500 Angstroms and red light roughly 6500.
So there's a big difference.
"And so white light would then give you the superposition of all these colors, and so you don't really get a very nice interference pattern of dark areas and bright areas, because all the colors begin to overlap and each live a life of their own."
What I can do with sound and what I did with water and what I have done with laser light
I can also do with radio electromagnetic waves.
With radar -- we have a 10-gigahertz transmitter here that we have used earlier in this course.
And so I will now show you that with radar you can also show interference patterns and the calculation that you see there are absolutely identical.
"The only thing I want to remind you of, that the approximation when you know capital L that the tangent theta is roughly the same as the sine of theta is only true for small angles."
"5 degrees is fine, 10 degrees is fine, but by the time that you reach 50, 60 or 70 degrees that approximation is not true."
So then you really have to take the tangent of theta.
"That's no problem because you first calculate what theta is, because that equation is correct, and then you can calculate always where X is, but then you use the tangent and not the sine."
So these are approximations which hold for small angles.
"And so if now we look at a 10-gigahertz transmitter, that means we have two transmitters, one here and one here."
And their separation D is 23 centimeters.
You see them here.
This is where they are.
"Here's one and here's the other, 23 centimeters apart."
At 10 gigahertz the wavelength is 3 centimeters.
You can confirm that.
The speed is speed of light.
Lambda is the speed of light divided by frequency.
That gives you the wavelength.
And we have here at a distance
"L which is 120 centimeters, we have here a receiver and a track, so this is X equals 0 and here we can move it along X and so you can calculate now at what angles seen from this point there will be a maximum there."
Theta 0 is obvious.
Right here there will be a maximum.
"The two waves, the distance between them is zero, R2 - R1 is 0."
So they will constructively interfere.
"But there is another angle, theta 1, for which again there will be constructive interference."
"But it's green, we did teach them about traffic lights, and next to a lock, a metaphor."
"So even if they don't get it totally right, its sort of placement and the various things that it conveys, they might get close enough to say, well, it probably means that this is better somehow."
So they're able to bootstrap conceptually just up enough.
"Or another example, this one more visual."
"We bring them in and we say, what does this application do?"
"And they're going to say, it's very pretty."
"And then they're going to say, I don't know, because while this icon is pretty, also I think, did you work on this one?"
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
ALEX FAABORG:
All right.
"For the designer in the room who worked on this, I'm sorry."
"It's a great icon, but it does not convey to the user in this test chamber with access to no other knowledge, what it actually does."
"It is a great application, though."
"It's shipped on all the devices you guys have, you should check it out."
I use it everyday.
This is Currents.
So what does this app do?
They're not going to know.
"So I would argue that success in these situations, it doesn't have to do with their intelligence, it has to do with access to information."
Is that information embodied in the thing that they're using?
"So quickly you're thinking, all right, well, what if I don't have this underground testing facility?"
That sounds really expensive.
"And that's true, and this is controversial, it's especially controversial for any user researchers in the room, or user researchers watching later."
"But I would argue while it's really, really useful to have access to user researchers, you don't absolutely have to rely on them."
"You could just start running user tests in your own head, basically short-term amnesia."
"What you have to do is you have to kind of encapsulate your mind, you have to start thinking, forgetting the things that you know about your interface, try to look at it with fresh eyes, try to think, OK, I've never seen this thing before, which is hard because you have seen it before, really, really hard."
"But if you can do that, if you can look at it with fresh eyes and try to have all the assumptions fall away that you've already built up, then you're able to do that kind of user test just on yourself quickly right then."
"And if you're just regularly doing that, it's going to really improve your applications."
I think this is one of the most important things that I can convey.
"But obviously, you're going to be more familiar with the underlying implementation because you are literally building it."
"In the case of a clock, you are probably intimately familiar with each of the gears and how they fit together and all of these details, but you have to just"
"I see a lot of people doing this, recognizing a failure in my position of the text there."
A bunch of scientists at the beginning of the last century wanted to figure this out.
"They were a bunch of Germans, they wanted to figure out how to order things and group things, and how we do that."
"They call this idea of order, they considered it order or rightness, they called it gestalt."
Here's an example of some gestalt principles at work.
You can see here how some very simple changes in the structure of the data make it so much easier to process on the right.
"Alex talked about these hierarchies of information and how, since we can't change the algorithms in people's brains, we have to speed things up by structuring the data."
"Well, these gestalt principles are how we structure the data."
"Now, I'm not going to go through all of the principles here."
"I'd recommend that you read the Wikipedia article on the topic, it's great."
I could have just read it and done well.
But I've distilled some of these ideas into two practical principles that you can put to work immediately when you're evaluating designs.
Here's the first one.
This is the thing that I wish that people had told me on the very first day of design school.
It's line stuff up.
That's it.
Everything should be lined up with something unless it has a good reason not to.
"So even if elements are at the very opposite sides of the screen and they're almost aligned, line them up."
"If we don't do it, then our subconscious brains are spending precious cycles trying to figure out, why are those things not lined up?"
Does it mean something?
Does it not mean something?
"It's almost like I'd compare it to a memory leak in your software, where something's going on, you're not exactly sure, but you're wasting your resources."
Let's line that back up.
That's better.
"So even stuff that isn't on the same screen, let's say three or four screens later, you've got something that's maybe in this case, a little bit above halfway down the page."
Line it up.
"Even though it doesn't seem like people will be able to make that association, and consciously they certainly won't, our visual processing systems are using that information to know how to decode this."
"Now I might also point out, if you do want to bring emphasis to something, then not lining it up is a really great way to do it."
You can see in these suggested paragraphs right here how just pulling one line out of alignment gives you a bunch of information about what's the most important and a lot of structure.
Here's the second big idea.
Design the spaces.
"Now, this is a little bit hard to do because again, our conscious brain is really good at examining objects in the foreground."
Hick's law is more interesting.
It's about solving for time based off of the number of choices and probability.
"It's been proven that if you simplify the Ul, people are going to be able to click on things faster."
"So the argument of, why don't we just introduce a button for that?"
It's because it has cost.
It literally makes interface less efficient if people have to search against it.
"So equation here, you have the number of equally probable choices, which first of all, no interface is going to have equal probabilities, so this form's bad."
What you actually want is summation with the probability of each one individually.
"And based off of that, you can determine when you have something lined up with others, what the access time is going to be as people try to locate the one that they're"
looking for and choose.
So the combination of things like Fitt's law and Hick's law goes into the field of cognitive modeling.
"And basically what this is, is predicting a performance assuming highly trained users."
"So unlike the self-describing section, here you're assuming that people know what everything is."
And it's purely about access time and how quickly they can target the control and get to it.
So a lot of this work is actually done.
"At NASA Ames, there's a really good group doing it right next to the Google campus, and they're primarily doing it for fighter pilots, actually."
"This is a simulator of the F35, and in this case, you obviously have really highly trained users because they know what every control does, and it's purely about visual access time and small controls and proximity to other small controls."
"But even for a standard interface, a mobile application or a desktop application, you could do this type of modeling to try to make sure things are super efficient, looking at the metrics."
So that's how to build great interfaces.
"But the things we talked about, self-describing, basically the user building a mental model and sort of simulating in their head how stuff works, preventing errors, making users fast, the idea of cognitive modeling."
That's how to make something really easy to use.
Show an example.
This is really easy to use.
"If you know you have to get to the other side, we talked about doors a bit, you know how to get there."
"You can assume the thing rotates, being inside a circle."
"There's no mode errors, because it only rotates in one direction, and it's easy to use."
It also looks like a human cheese slicer.
It is not a happy door.
"So that leads us to the second part, which is visual design."
Here's Christian Robinson.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So not to contradict you, but I think that the design of that is actually really quite appropriate."
"Now for all but the longest wavelengths, a radio telescope is just a dish, much like the main mirror of an optical telescope."
"But because radio waves are so much longer than visible light-waves, the surface of the dish doesn't have to be nearly as smooth as the surface of a mirror."
And that's the reason why it's so much easier to build a large radio telescope than it is to build a large optical telescope.
"Also, at radio wavelengths, it is much easier to do interferometry."
"That is, to increase the level of detail that can be seen by combining the light from two separate telescopes, as if they were part of a single, giant dish."
"The Very Large Array in New Mexico, for example, consists of 27 separate antennas, each measuring 25 metres across."
"Now each antenna can be moved around individually, and in its most extended configuration the virtual dish mimicked by the array measures 36 kilometres across."
So what does the Universe look like in the radio?
"Well, for a start our Sun shines very brightly at radio wavelengths."
So does the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
But there's more.
Pulsars are very dense stellar corpses that emit radio waves only into a very narrow beam.
"In addition, they rotate at speeds of up to several hundred revolutions per second."
"So in effect, a pulsar looks like a rotating radio lighthouse."
And what we see from them is a very regular and fast sequence of very short radio pulses.
Hence the name.
The radio source known as Cassiopeia A is in fact the remnant of a supernova that exploded in 17th century.
"Centaurus A, Cygnus A and Virgo A are all giant galaxies that pour out huge amount of radio waves."
Each galaxy is powered by a massive black hole at its centre.
Some of these radio galaxies and quasars are so powerful that their signals can still be detected from a distance of 10 billion light-years.
"And then there's the faint, relatively short-wavelength radio hiss that fills the entire Universe."
This is known as the cosmic microwave background and it is the echo of the Big Bang.
The very afterglow of the hot beginnings of the Universe.
Each and every part of the spectrum has its own story to tell.
"At millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths, astronomers study the formation of galaxies in the early Universe and the origin of stars and planets in our own Milky Way."
But most of this radiation is blocked by water vapour in our atmosphere.
"To observe it, you need to go high and dry."
"To Llano de Chajnantor, for example."
"At five kilometres above sea level, this surrealistic plateau in northern Chile is the construction site of ALMA: the Atacama Large Millimetre Array."
"When completed in 2014, ALMA will be the largest astronomical observatory ever built."
"64 antennas, each weighing 100 tonnes, will work in unison."
"Giant trucks will spread them out over an area as large as London to increase the detail of the image, or bring them close together to provide a wider view."
"So anyway, that's sort of what I wanted to say on productivity."
"Yeah, question?"
AUDlENCE:
"Does higher productivity translate into more income, or more income for individuals who will buy stuff [INAUDlBLE] taking more leisure?"
JON GRUBER:
Because basically the point is think of our economy as a pie.
"That basically the idea is let's think of you have a start up, and your start up is such that you can make this product, and you could make $1 million a year with 10 workers."
You could make $1 million worth of stuff with 10 workers.
"So each of your workers takes home $100,000."
"Now imagine that you discover new technology which lets you, with the same amount of workers, make $2 million a year."
"Well, some of that you'll keep, but some of it you'll pay your workers more."
"So suddenly they have more money, because you've suddenly managed to make twice as valuable stuff with the same amount of resources."
So that's the situation which improves our standard of living.
Other questions about that?
Comments?
"OK, so the bottom line, coming back to sort of micro-theory we're talking about, is we have to think about production functions as having a productivity adjustment."
"Macro raises these big issues about sort of ultimately what determines our standard of living in this country, and how do we want to spend that money?"
"So, with that as background, we're now going to stop talking about production and move on to cost."
Cost is-- quite frankly this is perhaps my least favorite thing in the whole course.
"It's a little bit boring, but you need to understand how cost structure in a firm works to understand how firms make the decisions that ultimately get to be a lot more interesting again, so just sort of bear with me."
"Now, so we talked about costs, let's start with a couple of definitions."
"Basically, let's back up, where are we coming from?"
"I talked about what the firm's decision is, the firm has to maximize profits, which is revenues minus cost."
So we have to ask what are costs if we're going to make this profit maximizing decision.
"Well, costs are going to have a few components."
"The first component, costs are going to have really two major components-- fixed costs, and variable costs."
Fixed costs and variable costs.
Fixed costs are the costs of inputs that cannot be varied in the short-run.
"Remember, I said that the short-run is defined as a period over time which only some inputs can vary."
"Well, fixed costs are the costs of those inputs that can't vary in the short-run."
"Variable costs-- so that's like capital in the short-run-- variable costs are the cost of goods that can vary in the short run, that's like labor."
"So total costs is the sum of these two, so total costs equals fixed cost plus variable cost."
"Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters."
"The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline, over and over."
"Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers -- that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure, which is currently rated at a D minus."
"So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,"
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
"And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites."
"They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,"
"like risk and responsibility,"
"like peripetia and anagnorisis,"
"like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone."
"It's been great talking to you and get back to work, will you?"
(Applause)
The same statistic was run for female students.
"Again, I made up the data to illustrate the effect."
Females tended to apply predominantly for major B with 900 applications for major B and just 100 for major A.
The university accepted 80 out of 100 applications in major A and 180 out of 900 in major B.
Please tell me the rate of acceptance in percent for major A for the females student population.
I believe the first step I took at the Mechina was my first step towards success in life
"After you finish the Mechina, you have the tools to succeed later on in life, in the army, in everything that follows"
"I think this Mechina in general isn't a Pre-military Academy, but a preparatory academy for how to live life"
"When we thought about erecting an institution in the city we deliberated what kind of institution it should be, and we decided that this is what Am Yisrael really needs now"
I went to Rabbi Drukman and asked him who should lead the Mechina
He told me to call Rabbi Boaz [Sherman.
"They asked me to lead the Mechina, to found it"
I debated about it and in the end
I decided to go ahead with the idea
"We brought a bus from Ashkelon, some guys from here and there we told the guys we recruited:"
"""Guys, there will be a new Mechina here next year"""
It was a very special experience.
"We began with 30 guys, ""the pioneers"" who came to the Mechina."
They began the idea in a really nice way.
"We came to Kiryat Malachi we sought a place for the Mechina, though we couldn't find a suitable place so we rented an apartment and a storage area which would serve as our Beit Midrash."

Research is an essential part of education.
Students are expected to cite articles from scholarly journals when they write research papers.
You probably use journal articles in your own work.
You've probably also encountered journal articles that you wanted to read but couldn't get access to.
Why is that?
"Well, let's take a look at how scholarly journals are published today."
Professor A does some research and writes an article about it for free.
He wants to publish it so he submits it to a journal in his field.
The journal likes his article so asks Professor B and C to peer review it.
"The professors read it, evaluate it and send it back for free."
"The journal sends Professor A the changes that need to be made, if any, and Professor A sends them the final version of his article at no cost to the journal."
The publisher then puts Professor A's article with a bunch of other articles and formats them all together and charges people for access.
How much does it cost to a campus library to buy a subscription to the journal?
It depends...
"If it is a journal of Econometrics, a year subscription costs as much as two thousand one hundred and fifty-five dollars if it is the journal of Geophysical Research, it costs five thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars. if it is the journal of Brain Research, it's twenty-one thousand seven hundred forty-four dollars. not all scholarly journals cost this much but when many of the key resources for students and faculty cost an arm and a leg, not even the best funded universities and libraries can afford them all."
So librarians buy what they can afford and students and the professors just have to hope they're not missing something important.
But it doesn't have to be this way
There is an alternative to the closed subscription-based scholarly publishing model:
Open Access
"Open Access is free, unrestricted online access to scholarly works."
"Open Access journals use advertising sponsorship, author fees and other sources of revenue to support the cost of publication, keeping the access free to the user."
Authors can choose to publish their articles in one over forty-two hundred peer-reviewed Open Access Journals or they can put a copy of work published elsewhere in an online repository.
Open Access lets anyone read the latest research.
"It helps scholars stay up-to-date on each other's work... it enables computers to sift text mining and mashups, which help uncover trends that no-one would have suspected it gives authors more visibility and impact... and makes scholar work a lot easier."
Open Access brings curious minds and the world's knowledge together.
Isn't that what academia is fundamentally about?
"Free, unrestricted, online access"
Open Access
"Also, we saw the invention of computer gaming, and the computer game authors pretty quickly realized that having READ statements didn't work for most games, that you wanted a different way of organizing the program so that it could be more responsive."
"But the mainstream didn't see much of this until, say, 1984, when the Macintosh came out."
"The Macintosh was the first mainstream product that got in front of mainstream programmers with this radically new idea of how to do interactive programs, which was not based on READ but on event loops; a radically different way of writing programs."
Were the programmers happy to have this new model?
"No, they were quite unhappy."
You have to write programs inside out!
Waa.
"Nobody can do that, it's too hard."
It's just not the way God intended us to write programs.
We should go back to the command line as he intended.
"So Apple had to work really hard to try to convince programmers no, really, it's OK, you can be successful writing in this model."
"They released a program called Mac App, which was a template of a Pascal program that already came with an event loop built into it with prototypes for setting up menus and things like that, so all you had to do was hook your logic into it."
"That was just too hard, it was rejected."
"It looked like Macintosh was not going to be the big success that it turned out to be, except for one thing:"
HyperCard.
"Bill Atkinson had this little multilayer paint program with a silly little scripting language in it, and suddenly everything took off because non-programmers could be incredibly productive with HyperCard."
"They could get a stack -- that's what they called programs at that time -- and they could open it up and look at the scripts inside of it and fiddle with them, and make wonderful things happen."
"In fact, there were thousands of stacks running around the world, most of them being written by people who had no business programming, just because it was fun and easy."
"After that the professionals kind of went oh, OK, I guess it's not that hard, we could probably do that."
Then we saw an explosion of programs for Macintosh and Windows when a new generation of programmers were finally able to work with the event loop.
HyperCard worked because it was all about events.
You didn't have to build an event
"loop; it was built in, it just worked."
All you had to write were the event handlers.
"A program -- again, a stack -- was just a collection of event handlers attached to things"
like cards and buttons and fields.
And the events could bubble up — that's how it did delegation.
"It called it inheritance, but it really wasn't inheritance."
It had events
"like on mouseUp and on keyDown, on cardEnter, which would be equivalent, say, to on load today."
"And on idle, which got fired whenever the event queue was empty."
I don't think they knew what people were going to use that for.
"And also ma, want to make sure you didn't overshoot it."
"Because if you overshot it, maybe you've got the firewall or the, I said widget."
"The firewall widget tightened down too much or, or, or something."
"You know, and there may be something you can do that would reduce that the, the, the degree by which you've overshot the, the baseline."
"Also, if the risk can't be contained within the acceptable level because you've got constraints, either in terms of budget or in terms of the attributes of the business."
"In other words, you know, we can't operate if we, if we have to put this control in place."
"Then, management may decide to accept the risk even though it's high."
"And the, those risks are also to be included in residual risk as you maintain this, these results of this risk assessment report."
"But those are the ones that probably are going to get the lion's share of your attention going forward. cuz those are the big, hairy ones for which you have not implemented any prevented, detected the work, recovery controls."
"Management is aware of them, because they've made this explicit decision to retain the."
"But you, all of you, are responsible for making sure nothing bad happens."
"I mentioned earlier I was going to give you an example of risk assessment report, and again this is a very simple one."
But it kind of puts all of the pieces together.
"The, the asset, in this case, was a customer list."
"And so, we looked at it in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability."
"And remember, I mentioned you could have this three point scale where three is high, two is medium, one is low."
"And, you know, I just threw some numbers in here so I've rated this high on confidentiality, medium on integrity, medium on availability."
"You look at the level of threats and it, again, it's a very generic term."
"But, you know, you obviously would look at specific threats but this is kind of a catch all."
"You know, I rated it two for confidentiality, two for integrity, and three for availability."
Level of vulnerabilities.
"Three for confidentiality, two for integrity, two for availability."
"And I just did a very, very simple methodology here where I just said, you know, what I'm calling the risk point is just the value of the asset times the threat times the vulnerability, A * B * C. It's just a way to rank it."
"So, three"
* two * three is eighteen.
Two * two * two is eight.
Two * three * two is twelve.
Which one are you going to focus the most attention on?
The eighteen.
"And then, you think about, well. what kind of treatment method can we apply to this? in this particular case , where you're"
"looking at confidentiality, the suggestion was that you reduce the risk by making the server password more difficult to guess."
"And by doing that, you reduce the level of threat to two and the level of vulnerability to two, so you've gone from eighteen to twelve."
"And soon enough, they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction."
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
"Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism."
"And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me."
"Imagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face."
"You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?"
You would recoil.
You would call the police.
(Laughter)
"You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction."
"We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly."
This is our body wisdom; it's not something mediated by our language.
Our body just knows that.
And we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
"It happens to some of our phyletic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long."
"So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without which they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, socially."
"Now, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you."
"Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;amp;M."
"So I could not attract her attention, but something -- a thing -- did."
"Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people."
"Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like."
"Now, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences."
"What she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging, moment by moment, as she is isolating herself further and further."
"So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we're going to be."
"But, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind, and this is what's happening with her brain."
"Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders."
And it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all; there are those individuals who talk too much.
"Farewell, Egypt"
"So, after you've done all these things with respect to assessment and treatment, there's going to be some residual risk."
"You can't treat risk out of the, out of the system completely."
"So then, you have to make some decisions with respect to which ones you're going to accept and which ones you're going to try to, to transfer. the, the decision is driven by a number of different things."
"The first is the, the three realities that make risk acceptance, the risk acceptance decision a foregone conclusion."
Every organization has to make it.
"Which are, you're not going to be able to deal with all the risks in the organization."
Second one is no system can be made absolutely secure.
"And third is that, you've got a limited pool of resources for addressing these exposures."
"So, given those three things, those three realities, there's going to have to be a decision at some point about which risks you're willing to accept."
"And the way that you do that is the organization, the organization being the organization's management. needs to decide, needs to decide what its tolerance level is."
How much risk it's willing to accept.
"And then, if the risk that's been identified through the risk assessment process is beyond that level, then you look at maybe implementing some supplemental controls."
"And, if it's been the level, then you accept it. continue to monitor it, make sure it doesn't get out of out of tolerance. but that's basically the approach."
"Now, and I, I, I know I say this a lot, but I'm going to say it one more time."
"When you think about how management defines it's, it's acceptable"
"level of risk, it's not just direct dollar cost."
"It's, you know, how sensitive are they to bad publicity?"
How sensitive are they to being embarrassed?
"I would argue that most senior executives would rather have bad news come out about the company that doesn't directly affect them than they would be to have information comes out that makes them look stupid, makes them embarrassed."
"So, that embarrassment factor is going to, and should come into play ."
"Because you don't want to run into a situation where, you know, management says, okay."
"We, we're willing to assume an aggregate exposure of twenty million dollars a year."
And we don't want anything about us no negative publicity on the front page of the local newspaper.
"And you say, okay, chief, you got it."
"And then, something happens."
"And it's, you know, section two of the paper, page three."
"But it's, you know, the CFO, you know, left his laptop in his car."
"It was stolen, and it had the company's financial records on it."
It was within the tolerance.
"But he's, he's embarrassed."
"And I guarantee you that if you go back to him, and say, well, you know, it was within the tolerance that you specified."
"People get off of gluten and they say, you know, remarkably, I feel better."
There's nothing wrong with following a gluten-free diet if you don't have Celiac disease.
"If you suspect you have Celiac disease, it's a good idea to get tested and have a confirmation of your diagnosis."
Many people find that they lose weight when they go on a gluten-free diet.
"If you've been consuming hundreds of extra calories from breads and pastas and rices, it makes sense that when you cut those foods out of your diet, you're going to"
lose weight.
"If you're interested in learning more about Celiac disease, I recommend you check out some of these resources."
"The Gluten-fFree Diet book, by Shelley Case, is a great resource."
"Shelley is a Canadian dietitian, who, herself, has Celiac disease."
"A number of the different foundations, like the Celiac Sprue Association, and the"
"Celiac Disease Foundation, can also provide you with valuable information. ."

"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On August 1, 2007, the eye 35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 45."
Newspaper articles followed asking questions why did the bridge collapse.
And the experts pointed to structural deficiencies such as corroded bearings or faulty-- fatigue cracks in the steel around the bridges joints.
"But for the victims and their families, the important question was not why did the bridge collapse, but why did the bridge collapsed at the exact moment when I was on it."
"Ann was on the bridge because she was on a cell phone with her friend, so she missed her exit."
Otherwise she wouldn't have been on the bridge when it collapsed.
"On the other hand, Jim was not on the bridge because he happened to meet a friend and stopped to chat, or he would have been on the bridge."
The questions the bridge victims asked are just like the questions of the Zande in the Central African Republic.
"Just the same questions when misfortune strikes them, they're not interested in why did the bridge collapse, but rather why did the bridge collapsed at the precise moment when I was on it."
But the Zande have a different kind of answer.
"It's not God, it's not karma, not coincidence, not God's will, but witchcraft."
The main point I was making today is that witchcraft gets a bad rap.
"It's seen as backwards, superstitious, barbaric, and pictures like this one, of a Zande witchcraft-- witch doctor, which I took, don't help."
But witchcraft among the Zande is not an irrational belief system from the heart of darkness.
"It does nothing more or nothing less than other belief systems do, including world religions."
"They all explain why things happen, especially bad things."
"They do so in a way that allows intervention, especially medical intervention, and it allows to blame someone else or something else for our misfortune."
I'll be making a plea today for cultural relativism.
"Deep down, one person's witchcraft is another person's Christianity."
"The Zande live where the three countries of South Sudan, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet."
- so accepting.
And that builds up.
"The most powerful emotion which I know, the inspiration of peace in deep meditation, and that has moved me to tears."
I've cried many times as a monk.
"But not out of grief, or out of anger, or out of frustration."
"Just cried out of pure inspiration, beauty, joy, delight, either in seeing amazing inspiring feats of others or just seeing the beauty and peace in your own heart."
This is actually what happens and why I've often said that it's the females in general do better in deep meditation.
"Simply because they have more familiarity, in general I'm saying, because there are many exceptions"
- and you're probably one of them [laughter].
"But I've noticed that because you do need that emotional sensitivity to be able to allow these positive emotions to grow, to be able to develop them in the first place."
Deep meditation is a powerful emotional state.
It's not a blanking out.
It's not an intellectual state.
It's what you feel - deeply.
"The whole point of mindfulness is being deeper where you already are - feeling it, being it."
"Not with thought, with this mindfulness which can accept the power of a still mind."
Those forces get very very strong.
I'd say the highest emotion I've ever felt are the emotions in deep meditation.
So still but incredibly powerful.
"They move you to become monk, they move you to stay as a monk, they move you to teach, they empower you."
So these are the very highest emotions.
"So in Buddhism we're not saying you should be this emotionless zombie, like a robot, because that's what sometimes people think."
"They think when you meditate you can't get any rise out of you, you're not supposed to tell jokes, or laugh at jokes, you're supposed to be like this automaton who doesn't feel because you're supposed to have no craving, no emotions, no attachment, you're never unhappy, you're never happy, you're sometimes in this middle just like.."
If that was the case I would never be a monk.
"We start the path with the corners of our mouth turned downwards, in the middle part of the path the corners of our mouth are horizontal, as the path develops those corners go higher and higher and higher [laughs]."
It's great seeing these enlightened masters in places like Thailand - and they're the happiest people who would really laugh.
"That told me something, that the goal of this is not being emotionally dead."
The goal of this path is having those negative emotions transcended and replaced by this beautiful inspiring peaceful kind compassionate empathetic emotions.
Caused by letting go of control.
Caused by kindness.
Caused by the great gentleness of respect to every moment.
"That way whatever's happening to you in your life, the negative emotions, make peace with them, they're going to pass, they're part of things."
How can that be?
"We just computed that on the one hand I, we I thought we had this symmetry relation."
Relativity tells us that if the black twin sees the blue clock running slow so does the blue twin see the black clock running slow.
What ruins relativity here?
"Well, when you think about it."
It's pretty clear that these two twins are not related by Lorentz Transformation.
"They were related by Lorentz Transformation, as long as twin number one, two was moving to the right at this constant speed, v. But there is a big difference in their life histories."
"And the big difference occurs, of course, here, at this instant."
Twin
Number two jumped from one spaceship to the other.
He was not inertial.
At that instant twin number two was actually accelerating.
"Not only that but as I drew it, since his velocity changed instantaneously the rate of change of his velocity was infinite."
He was experiencing an infinite acceleration.
"So that's not very realistic, but it makes the calculation simple."
But this is why the.
"Life history of the two twins is different, it's different and it's not, you don't expect symmetry if blue thinks black clock runs slow then black thinks blue clock runs slow, the difference is that one of them accelerated and the one who accelerated will be younger and this is brought out by drawing some auxiliary world lines here, so what I've done is at this event, event number one."
"I took, I drew before the t double prime axis the world line of the moving twin as h e returns."
I can now draw the auxiliary light cone and therefore the x double prime axis.
And here we see the resolution to the mystery because remember before I suggested that we introduce event number two over here which is.
What is this?
"This event is from the point of view of the blue twin of the, the moving twin as long as he is moving away from earth, event number two is simultaneous with event number one."
"So if these guys were exchanging messages then indeed when he decided to change The, to, to jump ships."
"The moving twin was, would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was."
And in just as the stationary twin would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was.
"Until that point, everybody's inertial, and life is symmetric."
But at the moment that he jumps ships.
"What happens is that, now, simul-, what he considers, when he's moving to the left, to be simultaneous with this same event #one is actually event #three over here."
Is line of simultaneity changed because you changed velocities instantaneously.
"So in particular over the instantaneous jump from ship to ship, his brother aged this much."
All of this aging took place essentially instantaneously during the instant that the moving twin jumped chips.
"This is the resolution.This is where the symmetry is broken, indeed this segment."
Steven:
So this is a painting that really does show the opulence of imperial France.
The moment that's being represented is clearly intermission.
The chandelier has been lowered into the space of the audience.
"The lights are up, and so the audience's gaze has shifted from the stage to themselves."
Beth:
"So Cassatt's family, although it was very wealthy, actually her father refused to support her desire to be an artist, and although he paid for her basic living expenses, refused to support her art supplies and her studio where she painted."
Steven:
"This, despite real support from the leading artists of the day."
"She was a close friend of Degas, who had enormous respect for her ability, and she was an extraordinary painter, in every way a peer of the great impressionist painters in Paris."
Beth:
This painting displays a virtuoso technique.
"Mary Cassatt gained her knowledge of painting from a variety of sources, but it was difficult because she was a woman."
Steven:
"Her first formal classes were at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art, but women were not allowed to study from the nude, even from within the context of art school."
Beth:
"And like many artists of her generation, they moved to Paris where there was a little bit more freedom for women who were aspiring artists."
"Although she couldn't enter the Ăcole des Beaux-Arts because she was a woman, she did enter the private studio of several accomplished artists and studied with them."
Steven:
"But the world was still a restrictive one for her, even in Paris, and she was not, for instance, able to spend time with her friends like Degas at the cafes."
"We see that, actually, reflected in her subject matter, which tends to be domestic, or perhaps a night out at the opera."
Beth:
"It's difficult, I think, to remember those restrictions for women when we look at this painting because there's an extraordinary sense of freedom about the woman who's depicted here."
She's leaning back on her right elbow.
"There's a strong diagonal that has a sense of informality and movement, real self-confidence"
Steven:
"The woman with a pearl necklace, perhaps Lydia seems so much her own agent in the world, and it really does remind us of the tensions that existed at the end of the 19th century, as women were really entering into the public space."
"You know that the tension between public and private is played out, not only in terms of the subject matter, not only the fact that they're in a kind of semi-private space within this booth in the public space of the opera house, but also in the contrast between light and shadow that plays across Lydia's body."
Look at the way the light picks up only the side of her face.
The front of her face is in shadow.
"Not only is it rather brave on Cassatt's part, but it also speaks to the representation of bourgeois culture, this notion of privacy and its importance, even as one views the stage with others."
Beth:
Not only with the poor but also with young people.
"Because in Davos, I saw that the owners of technology are mostly young."
"And so, the young people own the future."
"And so, and these are exciting times."
"I realize that that's also, you know, what innovation is about."
"Always have aspirations, always have hope so that - because aspiration drives innovation, invention and creation."
Thank you.
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.
"Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing for penetration testing purposes."
"And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with random testing sort of in the general software robustness."
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
"On many an occasion I've been camping in the Adirondacks, and one of my favorite periods is right at dusk, when the lake becomes absolutely glass-like."
"The sun is setting but you can still see the silhouettes of trees - all these conical spires, beautiful reflection on the water with the last few bits of sunlight."
And then you hear the wail of a loon.
"You'll hear one individual of the pair give this long, mournful wail, which is essentially saying,"
"""I'm here."
"Where are you?"""
"Generally, moments later, you'll hear the response from the other member of the pair giving its wail, saying,"
"""I'm over here."""
Loons are active at night.
"You can be out in a beautiful Adirondack lake after dark, or a northern Minnesota lake, and this is one of the characteristic, evocative sounds you're going to hear from that area - something that'll stick with you for the rest of your life."
"It just punctuates the fall of night and really sets the mood for what follows: the solitude, the peacefulness."
It's all wrapped up in that one vocalization.
Thorotrast was a contrast medium used in Germany since 1890.
"It was used in Japan since 1930, but it was found that 25 to 30% of people developed liver cancer 20 to 30 years later."
Why does it take so long before cancer develops?
Thorotrast is an alpha-radiation nuclide.
"Alpha radiation injures nearby cells, and the DNA that is harmed most is a gene called ""P53""."
"We now know, thanks to genome science, the entire sequence of human DNA."
"However, there are 3 million locations on the DNA that are different from person to person."
"So today, it doesn't make sense at all to proceed as if all humans are the same."
"The basic principle should be the ""personalized medicine"" when we look at internal radiation - which DNA is damaged, and what kind of change is taking place."
Pressures for reform come from all sorts of directions and it is constant; why should not it be?
"As this country changes over the years, so what people expect from their Parliament is changing."
We had a massive controversy a hundred years ago about whether women should be given the right to vote and whether they should be in Parliament.
Of course in recent years we had a woman
"Prime Minister in Margaret Thatcher, so that was a dramatic change, as have been the number of women Members of Parliament in the House of Commons."
"More recently there have been similar pressures saying that Britain now is of course a country of many ethnic groups, many people of different cultural ethnic-social backgrounds."
Perhaps Parliament needs to be more representative of that diversity?
And we have seen that in all political parties now.
"When you look at both sides of the Chamber, you will see that the people who are sitting there reflect the diversity of the country."
Not perhaps entirely to the level required but huge progress has been made in recent years in that direction.
Pressures for reform of Parliament and its procedures come from many quarters.
They come from Parliament itself.
I can remember well the days when I was a young backbencher myself and there was a very considerable move for select committees.
"Now, select committees are hugely important."
"Committees go into the development and the wherewithal as to what is happening in various government departments. They are very important,"
But there was a great deal of contention. There were groups that did not want to go that far but we won through and we have now the select committees.
So there is change that is made there that comes from Parliament itself.
"It comes from Parliament itself too when we want to restrict the number of constituencies there are, thereby restricting the number of Members of Parliament."
"It comes also from outside, from outside bodies, from non-governmental organisations, from business and from industry."
We are by no means perfect.
We have warts and all.
"But change is constant, it is constantly there and we examine it from whatever quarter it comes from."
"The Parliamentary system in the United Kingdom is a work in progress, requiring regular scrutiny."
We are constantly looking to improve; building on the positive and learning from negative experiences.
"I think the strengths of UK Parliamentary system, and I would almost answer this in the same breath as what are the weaknesses, the real answer is that the system is as effective as its Members want to make it."
I think its strengths are that it is willing to change.
It is willing to look at itself and say that these things are not good enough.
We must make some improvements.
We must make progress.
I hope you have enjoyed this production and that it has offered an insight into the way in which the United Kingdom Parliament operates.
We all look forward to working together with you in the future as friends and colleagues.
"August, 1984."
The dietary restrictions for the MAO inhibitor actually only apply to the nine milligram and higher doses.
"So, the lower end we don't need to necessarily restrict."
"It can be a little confusing for patients, so you have to be pretty clear on it."
And you still have to follow the wash-out rules that we just talked about.
It's not any simpler in terms of getting the patient on or off the medication.
But this is a new drug that just became available in the last couple of years.
"So now we're going to talk about the SSRls, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors."
"And these consist of Citalopram, Escitalopram,"
"Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine,Paroxetine, and Sertraline."
And we're going to talk about some of the differences between each of the agents.
"This is a class of drugs, but they are all unique, and just because someone tries one and has a positive or negative experience, doesn't mean they will have the same experience on another agent."
"So, oftentimes we think of the SSRI as just being this simple, easy drug to work with, and it just increases the amounts of serotonin - it doesn't have any affects on other receptor sites."
"But, as you'll see in the next slide, this isn't as clean-cut as we envision it to be in this slide."
"So you can see we've got the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but we've got all this other noise going on that makes each combination of the antidepressant, how they use these other receptors, give each drug its unique profile."
The first SSRI that we're going to talk about is Fluoxetine.
"This is Prozac, Prozac weekly,"
"Serafem also, and Fluoxetine generic."
Fluoxetine has multiple indications.
"It's indicated for Major Depression, which we're focusing on."
"It's also indicated for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"
"Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is where the Serafem actually comes into play,"
"Bulimia, Panic Disorder, and Bipolar Depression - when it's combined with a different antipsychotic."
The average dose of someone taking fluoxetine is twenty to eighty milligrams a day.
It only needs to be dosed once a day.
The weekly preparation: basically the rule is ninety milligrams is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
So ninety milligrams a week is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
"Some of the unique aspects of fluoxetine: it has a very long half-life, because it has an active metabolite."
"So the half-life is up to even three, four days."
"So, it's a positive for patients who forget to take their medication from time to time, because we're not going to see any symptoms of withdrawal, the blood levels are going to stay pretty clean, we're not going to have any issues with that."
We do see some levels that can see some synergistic effects.
"Now, all these drugs"
- we talk about SSRls increasing just serotonin - you get indirect effects on other neurotransmitters.
With Western up 6 to 2 after Grandview converted a penalty.
Chrissy Campbell put the finishing touches on the offensive out-burst.
Campbell touched away and that will be 7 to 2 right at the death.
With the win Western moved to 5 and 2 on the year.
The 7 goal out-burst was the most scored in a single match since 2009 when Western scored 7 times against the same Grand View squad.
Welcome.
"This is the first, of three lessons, in week one, in the fundamentals of financial, personal financial planning course."
"Have you ever found yourself in a new city, looking for a particular store or restaurant, but you're not sure how to get there?"
"Then, suddenly you come across a large map just like the one shown here."
Isn't it comforting to see that big you are here symbol. so you know where you are and where you need to go?
"Well, in this first lesson, I'm going to show you how to build your financial you are here starting point."
"So, where are you today?"
What shape are your finances in.
"In order to answer this, you need to examine three parts of you financial picture."
"Your network statement, your cash flow and your emergency funds."
"In this lesson, I'll describe each of these components and give you a toll to help you determine your networks."
"By carefully analyzing these aspects for your finances, you'll get a good sense of your current financial health."
"First, a net worth statement or personal balance sheet is simply a summary of your assets and liabilities as of a given date."
It's just a snapshot.
"Simply put, it involves adding up what you own and subtracting out what you owe."
"Some examples of assets are things like your checking account, savings, certificate of deposit or CD, money market accounts, the cash value of a life insurance policy, and your real estate."
"Other assets are like investments, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts, and pension funds."
"Your assets also include any personal property such as your cars, recreational vehicles, jewelry and anything else in your home that you think is valuable enough to list."
"Now, on to the other half of the equation, what do you owe?"
"Some examples of liabilities, are student loans credit card debt, your mortgage, car loans, bank loans, personal debt to friends or family, business loans that you personally owe, or even back taxes you might owe, the IRS."
"It's really debt that you owe to anyone, whether you have a printed statement or not."
This i s how you arrive at your net worth.
"After you've calculated your net worth using a worksheet, you will know whether you have a positive or a negative net worth."
Take a look at the definition shown here.
"Without even doing the math, you may already have a hunch where you fall at this point."
Are you in the red or are you in the black?
"Either way, this is essential information, so you have, so you have to begin to grasp all the elements of sound financial planning."
Hello once again.
This is Roger Coke Barr for the Bioelectricity course.
"We're in Week five, Segment three."
"In the past segment, we were talking about how, when you lay track."
"You have to be conscious of the fact that each, each place on the ground connects with its neighbors."
You have to be conscious of whether you're going uphill or downhill.
You have to be conscious of whether you're going across a stream or up a mountain.
It's similar in bioelectricity when you begin to talk about currents.
"When you talk about currents, you have to think about what kind of tissue am I in."
"What are these, what is the physical and physiological structure because I'd like to know how currents are moving from one place to another."
"Before getting into the details of analyzing a particular case, let's look at some alternatives."
Just to have some idea of what is what are different kinds of structures that have to be considered as one considers a range of different kinds of tissue.
"So, the simplest structure is that of a uniform cylindrical fiber."
"This diagrammatically, we just do it like this."
"One simple centrical fiber in a tissue structure sense, very simple."
Although what happens within it can be rather complicated.
"As an alternative, think of a bundle of cylindrical fibers."
"So, if I draw a cross section."
"Here's may be the outer sheath of the bundle, but within it, there may be lots of fibers."
"So the whole space is filled up with many, many individual fibers within the sheet."
"To our first approximation, all these fibers inside, act as if they were independent, individual fibers."
"But they, they're performance may be affected by the fact that there are others nearby."
"If for no reason other than the, the adjacent fibers are using up space, and making it harder for the extra sailor current to flow."
"Of course, there's still other structures."
Maybe one fiber comes along and it branches.
"And maybe in the process of branching, the diameter of the fiber changes."
"So, one then must take into account both the fact that towards the end, there are two rather than one."
"But then, also the fact that the diameter over here is small and the diameter over here is big."
All those things will affect how current flows from one place to another.
"And then, for the heart and for the brain especially, but in many other particular cases, you have large numbers of small cells, and they're all clustered together in a very tight packing."
"These may be 2D clusters, two-dimensional sheets of cells as is true, more or less in the cardiac atrium or this may be a big three-dimensional mass of cells, where rather than trying to draw a cell by cell,"
"I'll just make a line, but where there's an entire volume of space that's filled up with small cells."
"Because healthcare costs are rising extremely rapidly, the impact of including a much smaller healthcare weighting is a reduction in reported inflation."
"By simply reinstating the actual level of healthcare spending, our reported CPI would be several percent higher."
But the most outlandish adjustment of them all goes by the name
"""hedonics,"" the Greek root of which means ""for the pleasure of."""
"This adjustment is supposed to adjust for quality improvements, especially those that lead to greater enjoyment or utility of the product, but it has been badly overused."
Here's an example.
"Tim LaFleur is a commodity specialist for televisions at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where the CPI is calculated."
I'm guessing he works in a place that looks like this.
"In 2004, he noted that a 27-inch television selling for $329.99 was selling for the same price as last year, but was now equipped with a better screen."
Hmm.
"After taking this subjective improvement into account, he adjusted the price of the TV downwards by $135, concluding that the screen improvement was the same as if the price of the TV had fallen by 29%."
"The price reflected in the CPI was not the actual retail store cost of $329.99, which is what it would cost you to buy, but $195."
Bingo!
"At the BLS,"
TVs now cost less and inflation is heading down.
"At the store, they're still selling for $329.99."
Hedonics are a one-way trip.
"If I get a new phone this year and it has some new buttons, the BLS will say the price has dropped."
"But if it only lasts eight months instead of 30 years, like my old phone, no adjustment will be made for that loss."
"In short, hedonics rests on the improbable assumption that new features are always beneficial and are synonymous with falling prices."
"Over the years, the BLS has expanded the use of hedonic adjustments and now applies these adjustments to everything from TVs, automobiles, washers, dryers, refrigerators, and even to college textbooks."
Hedonics are now used to adjust as much as 46% of the total CPl.
So what would happen if you were to strip out all the fuzzy statistical manipulations and calculate inflation like we used to do it?
"Luckily, John Williams of shadowstats.com has done exactly that, painstakingly following each statistical modification over time and reversing their effects."
"If inflation were calculated today, the exact same way it was in the early 1980""s,"
Mr. Williams finds that it would be running at closer to 13% than the currently reported 5%.
"This is a stunning 8% difference, which explains much that we see around us."
It explains why people have had to borrow more and have been able to save a lot less - because their real income was actually a lot lower than reported.
A higher rate of inflation is consistent with weak labor markets and growing levels of debt.
It fits the monetary growth data better.
So many things that were difficult to explain under a low-inflation reading suddenly make sense.
The social cost to this self-deception is enormous.
"It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building."
"The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this."
What's interesting about it is not the shape.
What's interesting about it is how it's made.
How it's made.
"A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization."
"No, it is not an oxymoron."
"What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again."
That's why we all live in developer houses.
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
That's because it's cheaper.
"Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts."
"The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine."
It doesn't care.
It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost.
It doesn't spend any extra time.
"It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time."
"Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,"
"like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."""
"And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals."
"Just simple ""Bolt A to B"" and they will be able to put them together."
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end.
"You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura."
"Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series."
"And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?"
"In the summer, you go to the beach."
"And when you go to the beach, what do you get?"
You get sand dunes.
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
"They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood."
So he's surrounded by drug addicts and drunks.
"And so, there are no village models."
We have
lost the fathers in our home and the heroes in our communities.
And the fourth is that he's in a survival mode.
And so the environment is quite predatory and mercenary.
And fifth is that it's a subsistence economy.
"We call it ""Isang kahig, Isang tuka""."
"One scratch, one peck."
And so we realize that a country that does not deserve to be poor is poor.
A country that has a tradition of very strong Christian values is one of the most corrupt.
"And so, this was the source of my midlife crisis."
And I realized too that I just follow the old patterns.
"You know, send your children to the most exclusive schools, become successful,"
live in an exclusive subdivision and just create your own artificial bubble of security and comfort in a sea of third world poverty.
And I realize that that's not the kind of legacy I wanted to pass on to my children.
They cannot wander in the - they cannot walk the streets in safety.
"And especially the most successful, they are also the most vulnerable to crime and to rebellion."
"At the same, in the countryside, the poor continued to be the most vulnerable to the calamities, to the typhoons and to the floods."
"So I realized too that at 35, I was at the prime of my life, I had so much energy, why was I so unhappy?"
And that's when I went to the biggest slum in the country called Bagong
"Silang, north of Manila, and started to really discover because I was in search of my soul, as a Filipino, as a Christian and as a human being."
And I did not find it in the artificial surroundings that I just boxed myself in.
"I lived in an exclusive subdivision with security guards, with high walls."
"And I was surrounded by squatters around me, my people, my family that I did not know."
And so I realized that I had to go beyond my own definition of family.
"I had to consider the poor, the orphans, the criminals, the rebels as my family."
"Otherwise, I will not invest my time, my talent, my treasure, I'll just - it's just convenient to write out a check and just perpetuate this whole tradition of charity."
"So anyway, I realized that it is really about connectivity that the brightest and the best, those with the greatest opportunities are disconnected from our people, are disconnected from the land, are disconnected from the rich natural resources and that's the reason why we're poor."
"You know, there are countries that do not have the fertile land that we have, do not have the biodiversity, the rich natural resources, do not even have our producer - our human resource and our market base, almost 100 million market base."
"And, you know, it's now very interesting for me just coming home from Davos where I was invited two weeks ago."
"And yesterday, it was very fascinating that finally what a - my own reflections about Davos was printed at the Huffington Post."
"It means you can't keep the information in the server, you've got to keep it somewhere else."
"One place people put it is on the wire, so you put it in the cookies or you put it in headers, or you put it in secrets fields or in URLs, so you're passing all that information back and forth all the time, which is really inefficient."
"Some people got tired of that and decided OK, let's just put it in the database."
That's an awful place to put it.
That's like the worst possible place in the universe to be putting your ephemeral state.
That's just not where you want to do it.
But you don't have anywhere else.
"Fortunately, there is an alternative."
There's a system called Elko that was developed by
"Chip Morningstar, which is all about maintaining session in these servers."
He's got a device called a session server.
You initially connect to the session server and the session server will determine:
"OK, we'll use one of these servers for your session."
"It'll tell you about it, and it'll tell the server about that, and from that point on, the browser and that particular server have a connection that they preserve through the life of the session."
"The wonderful thing about that is, where does the ephemeral state now go?"
It goes in JavaScript variables that are closed over the event handlers that are in the event queue in the server.
"They are in the best place in the universe, where there is absolutely no cost at getting that information and making it available to the application."
You add that to the node.js now and the amount of work you have to do in order to do a stepwise increment in the
"Ajax application starts to get really, really small."
So you've got some really wonderful stuff now happening in server architecture because of opportunities afforded to us by
JavaScript.
A final thought.
"A little while ago I was talking to a friend of mine — a really bright guy, one of the smartest programmers I know -- about what we should do next with JavaScript."
"I suggested to him that we should get the tail recursion thing going, we should get that fixed."
Why do we want to do that?
"Well, I said, among a lot of other things it would allow us to do continuation style passing."
"I think that would be a useful option for us to be able to provide within the language, and if we don't optimize the tail calls then we don't get that."
His answer was:
"I've never used continuation passing, so I really don't see the value of it, which I immediately recognized as a really stupid answer."
"The way I was able to recognize it so fast is that I have used that same argument myself, and I've been hearing that same argument throughout my entire career."
"Basically, the core of that argument is:"
"""I'm not qualified to make a decision about that."
"We've done sessions in California, in New York, in Chicago, in Boston..."
I've been to Montreal once before... our partners Savoir-faire Linux was there...
"We've been doing sessions across Europe, the UK, Germany,"
"Norway (where CFEnfgine is based originally),"
"France Italy, Spain, Switzerland..."
We've been all over the world !
"The next one is gonna be in Montreal with you guys from Savoir-faire Linux, that's gonna be in September."
We've tried to tailor the course to adapt different types of public.
First half day is actually a generic introduction.
"It is a non technical morning where we cover why you'd want to do automation -- how it works, basically."
We compare the various automation tools available around there at the moment.
So that can be useful for less technical people maybe
-- Managers or ClOs -- to attend to get a feeling for what the tool can do.
We do accept attendees for that just half day.
After that we dive into CFEngine fundamentals.
"So we have one-and-a-half days of understanding how CFEngine works, how you set up a server, how you set up a client how you can edit configurations files, copy them, run processes, install packages"
-- all the basics sysadmin features used in CFEngine.
"One by one, we've got the theoretical presentations but also a lot of practical hands-on."
I really believe that the best way to learn what CFEngine is but probably most technical things is to practice to do it yourself with someone experienced seating next to you to help.
"And then the third day is what I call the advanced class, the industrialization course. and we're basically putting together all the building blocks that we learned the first two days so that you make useful solutions."
To benefit from the course altogether you need a system administration background because when you automate things system administration comes up.
So you need to know about them before you automate them.
You don't need to be a super senior hot guy
"-- just if you understand the basics of Linux or Unix system administration how to run services, install packages, edit config files, you'll be fine."
The third day actually continues on from the second day so anyone following the first two days can follow the third day as well -- no problem.
"People who already have some CFEngine knowledge and wanna come along for the third day, that's fine too."
-- Goodbye Jonathan !
-- Goodbye and thank you very much !

"According to physicists, the level-one parallel universe... is just an extension of our own universe."
"Now, that's the kind of universe... which is really sort of part of our space... of our giant space... but it's so far away that we can't see it."
The level-one parallel universe is based on the idea... that the universe is infinite in size.
"If true, just by the sheer mathematical odds... there must be out there in endless space... an exact copy of the solar system, the Earth... and all the people on it."
If you're planning a trip... the closest level-one parallel universe... is really incredibly far away.
"Crudely speaking, you have to go googolplex yards... where a googol is one with a hundred zeroes after it... and a googolplex is one with a googol zeroes."
"So it's an awfully long way, farther than we can see."
Those universes are so far away that light hasn't reached us.
But is our universe really infinite?
A new theory called cosmic inflation suggests that it is.
"We think that it was born in a very, very small state... and then there was a kind of a weird energy... that pushed it apart by a tremendous amount."
It just went whoosh.
Inflation accounts for how our universe... suddenly and massively grew after its inception.
"The best theory we have right now for what made space so big- the theory of inflation- says, in fact, that space isn't just big or huge... that it's really infinite."
"It goes on forever... which means that there aren't just one, two, three... but infinitely many other regions of space... just as big as our universe."
Even the universe that we know is mind-blowingly big.
"When we fly around in intergalactic space like this... every little blob you see here can contain a galaxy... which, in turn, might contain hundreds of billions of stars... with solar systems around them and so on."
So there's just this enormous number of other spaces out there... that we can't see.
And there is more.
We actually think that there's a gigantic number... perhaps even an infinite number of level-one universes.
This radical idea is leading... to a completely new definition of the cosmos.
"We used to say universe, ""uni"" meaning one- a one-world theory."
"Everything there is, everything we can see is the universe."
"Now, we have a multiverse idea where there are unseen worlds- worlds that we cannot see, worlds that we cannot touch."
"If this wild theory is correct, the consequences are sensational."
Within this infinite universe... you might have other copies of the solar system... of planet Earth.
And this is the real shocker.
Then there's a copy of me and you... and everyone else out there somewhere.
And that's not all.
There are an infinite number of other universes and other Earths... and infinite copies of each one of us.
"If true, then every possible outcome for every life has to happen."
"In some universes, in what some now call the multiverse... one leads exactly the same life... but in others, things can be slightly different."
"Then the next part is step two, 2B. which is to specify Googlebot's preferred behavior."
"So given that parameter, how would you like Googlebot to actually crawl those URLs."
And we'll talk more about this as well.
[music in background]
The first parameter I'd like to cover is the sort parameter.
And we're covering this first.
But it's a fairly complicated parameter and setting.
The sort parameter is something like
"""sort equals price ascending"" or ""rank by equals bestselling."" Any of these types of parameters that just change the order that the content is presented."
These are sort parameters.
"Once you identify a sort parameter or sort parameters on your site, the next part is to specify Googlebot's preferred behavior for when they see URLs with this parameter."
Now this can get pretty tricky.
So I have two scenarios here.
Let's go through the first scenario.
"You could ask ""Is the sort parameter optional throughout my entire site?"" Meaning that the sort parameter is never displayed by default."
But only with manual selection.
"If you can answer ""Yes"" to that question, that ""Yes, it's optional throughout my entire site."" Then go on to question two."
"""Can Googlebot discover everything useful when the sort parameter isn't displayed?"" Meaning that we can actually crawl all of your items even if no sort parameter is present on the URLs."
"If that answer is ""Yes"" and the first answer is ""Yes"" then it's"
"likely that with your sort parameter you could specify ""crawl No URLs."" Once you've applied this setting, please verify that the sample URLs displayed in Webmaster Tools are in fact not canonicals."
So they're just duplicates.
"And that the canonical URLs, the URLs that you really want crawled and indexed, can be reached by regular user navigation."
"If the first sort parameter recommendation didn't apply to your site, then hopefully the second recommendation will."
"The second recommendation is, if the same sort values are used consistently site-wide."
"The questions to ask yourself are, ""Are the same sort values used consistently across my entire site?"""
"So a negative example of this, where the user would say ""No"" is if you're a Webmaster selling things like coins and coin albums."
"So for your coins, you might have ""sort equals"" with the value ""year issued."" But ""sort equals year issued"" doesn't apply to the selling of your coin albums."
So it's not used consistently.
"If the answer to the first question is ""Yes,"" Then you can ask yourself the second question."
"Which is, ""When a user changes the sort value, is the total number of items unchanged?"" If that answer is also ""Yes"" then it's likely that with your sort parameter you can specify"
"""only crawl URLs with value x"" where X is one of the sorting values that's used site-wide."
"If neither of those recommendations apply to your sort parameter, then perhaps select"
"This is the thing that Google showed us with Google Gears, which was brilliant."
"You can take another process, put your program in it, and it will send an event back to your event loop when it's finished."
That's brilliant.
We can even take that further.
There's no reason why that process needs to be on the same machine.
It could be on another machine.
It could be anywhere in the world.
It could be closer to the data rather than to us if that turns out to be the most effective place to put it.
"Another way people think about doing this stuff is the remote procedure call, which combines two great ideas, functions and networking, producing a really bad idea."
[laughter]
"Like READ, it attempts to isolate programs from time."
"There was a long time when that was thought to be a good thing, but when you're doing highly interactive programs — especially programs that deal with people — it turns out to be a really bad thing, because the program blacks out."
"It experiences lost time, and it's not aware that it blacks out."
"Reading the program, it is by design difficult to see where the time is lost, because remote procedure call is a deception."
"It's intended to disguise the fact that you're going across the network by making everything appear to be nice, local, fast calls."
"All of this can result in a terrible experience for the user, because lost time turns into annoying delays, and people don't like that."
It's rude and it's disrespectful.
It's not a good way to treat people.
"What we need to do instead is to give people the best feedback possible, and latency compensation is an important technique in doing that."
"At a minimum, we need to immediately acknowledge the user's input."
"The user clicked or entered something, and we need to let them know right away that we got it, we know what you're doing, and we're on the case."
We don't want to lock up the interaction while we're waiting for the server's response.
We want to keep everything dynamic.
In some applications we can actually do better than that.
"If we can predict what the server's response is going to be, we can go ahead and put that on the screen."
"If it turns out that we predicted wrong then when the server tells us so we can then correct it, but for a lot of applications that can make an extremely nice experience for the user."
Let's talk about security.
Security is a really important thing.
"We saw when you're trying to write applications using threads that security really isn't attainable because you don't have consistency, and without consistency you can't reason about the correctness of your program."
Correctness is virtually impossible; at least it is for me in that environment.
We do better in an event driven system than in a threaded system.
"But just avoiding threads doesn't guarantee that you're going to be secure, either."
What was reduced?
"The oxygen was reduced by the hydrogen, and if you actually add these two reactions up, if you make this the left hand side of your equation and you make this your right hand sade of the equation, you can say"
"""Ok"" Let's remove the electrons from both sides and you'll end up with your original reaction."
"What was, and just to make sure our terminology is right, what's our oxidizing agent?"
"It's the thing that did the oxidizing, it's the oxygen."
What's the reducing agent?
It's the hydrogen.
Ket's do one more.
So here
"I have iron, plus some Hydrochloric acid, let's say this is in an aqueous solution, and you end up with iron (Il) chloride plus some hydrogen."
"So let's do some oxidation numbers, and I'll do it fast this time. iron is just by itself it's got a zero oxidation state."
"Hydrogen with chloride, chlorine's a halogen. haloge, these guys love to take electrons-they love to take one electron, they typically have a minus one oxidation state, so the chlorine is going to have minus one, the hydrogen is going to be plus one."
"Add them together you get to a neutral compound, fair enough. now you go on this side, what is chlorine's oxidation state?"
Well once again it always likes to take one electron.
"So this is minus one, but I have two chlorines here, this is a neutral compound so the iron oxidation state must be plus two."
Plus two.
What about the hydrogen?
"Well now it is jus in its elemental form, so it's going to be neutral and have a zero oxidation state."
So what was oxidized?
"Our iron, our iron went from neutral to being, to having two electrons taken away from it which gave it a positive charge, so plus two electrons got taken away, so this was oxidized."
This is oxidized.
What about the hydrogen?
"The hydrogen went from two hydrogens with a plus one oxidation state and essentially they went to two hydrogens with a neutral state, so two electrons must have been added to the hydrogens. two electrons were added, their charge was reduced, so they were reduced."
And what were they reduced by?
They were reduced by the iron.
What was the iron oxidized by?
It was oxidized by the hydrogen.
"What about the chlorine, the chlorine has a minus one oxidation number here, it has a minus one oxidation number here, it was neutral relative to the redox reaction, anyway I think you get the point now, and you can do this with a bunch of reactions, but this will give you a little more insight of actually whats going on and who's gaining and who's losing electrons and in the future it will also help us think about alot of the structures of molecules."
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"To dress up like hipsters,"
And make fun of our exes.
Martin:
How do you look at the whole scenario we are moving into now?
Ole:
"Now I also work a lot with economy, beeing employed at a business school and have done so for many years when I was young I was very interested in Marxist ideas and economic theories so as I see it unfortunately we are heading into some very horrible scenarios and it applies to both the economy as a whole and our relationship with nature and the terrible thing is that we only do something about it when it's too late"
It might as well lead to a cultural revival and it's actually from there I think it would arrive
Martin:
A cultural revival?
Ole:
"Yes, a cultural revival ... a spiritual awakening is perhaps a better word a spiritual awakening where you understand that you have to saddle completely and radically over again but the cost will be very high before this consciousness change occurs"
"Now they register 40,000 cars a day, in China and that just can't go on.."
"Thank God the Chinese don't use toilet paper, cause if they did, we wouldn't have any forests left and presumably, no oxygen"
Martin:
"No, but there would be a better smell in China anyway you see there is a catastrophe scenario, but you hope there will be a kultural revival?"
Ole:
In disaster scenarios there are always cultural revivals
Martin:
"Well, you see those things?"
What are the symptoms of those things?
Ole:
"I like many of the things going on in the culture where people start to deal with what is called ""the spiritual"" but it is a very complex concept and there is so much ""Boss word"" about it but I sense a much greater need for spirituality and the answers to problems in terms of being mortal and having a soul in a body .."
"""Soma Sema"" as Plato said, ""The body is the requirements of the soul"""
One tends to focus more on that and although the solutions are confusing and weird and often commercially mediated and very distant from those that religion gave because it was institutionalized yet I see an awareness of our spiritual sides that also appear in the way we discuss how to help each other so in that way it's not a bad society we have
Martin:
You have insider information from CBS .. it is also something that the future leaders are thinking of? ole:
Yes very much ... you are even judged on whether you do so by your employees so you can not do it differently
Martin:
"So, there's only been a short time from these rabbit killer courses where you have to develop a kind of cynicism and the way people lived in the 80s to what we see now?"
Ole:
"Yes that's completely ""out"", what we are trying to do now is to set the values ​​in the center and make leaders to people who relate to their own humanity to the community and to their own human edification, to tell the truth, and I really like that."
Martin:
"And there is something about it that you associate it with art, right?"
Ole:
"Perhaps somebody in the group is the legitimate leader, who's been appointed to be the head of that group."
And it's important that they run the meeting and not somebody else take it over.
So power use.
"Is there some power, inappropriate use of power, try to use power for personal use even."
And then we get into fairness.
We don't want to discriminate.
We don't want to stereotype people.
We want to make sure everybody has a fair chance for whatever opportunities are there that the decisions we make are fair to everyone in the group as well.
They won't dump all the work on one person.
"There are rules about politeness and yelling or insulting, as well as rules about listening that we don't interrupt."
"These are all important parts of just being social, being courteous and polite, and that's important in a team just as much as it is in relationships."
And what we're going to do next is we're going to go to the subject of status.
"Now, status is a very difficult to understand variable because it's very closely related to power."
"In fact, just understanding the difference between power and status, sometimes it's sort of tough to draw that line."
You'll be probably doing an exercise or a paper just on the subject of status and power in this course.
So be ready to understand what these are and be ready to define them as you do your assignments or take your exam.
Let's talk about status.
There are actually two types of status.
"Let me define it first, so before we actually look at the types of status."
What status is is it's simply how much value or importance we put on someone in our eyes.
"Like somebody is a celebrity, somebody is, maybe there is somebody we all look up to because maybe it's the mayor of our town that's in this group, so they have high status."
"Or maybe the minister is in our group, so that person has higher status in our eyes."
"So, maybe we are going to listen more to this person, maybe not."
But status is how important we all seem to be in the eyes of the community and others.
And we're going to talk about two types of status.
The first type of status is what we call ascribed status.
"Now, ascribed status is based on a lot of factors about ourselves or mostly socioeconomic and demographic."
"You know like maybe it's our income level, maybe it's the job we do or career, maybe we're teachers or lawyers, or maybe we're managers, or maybe we're athletes or have other jobs where there is a lot of status attached to that career."
Gender also is a factor that can affect status.
Sometimes if we have too many men or too many women one gender could actually not be respected as much or given as much status depending on our view.
Physical attractiveness can affect status.
Maybe some people are handsome and tall.
Now certainly you go to certain parts of
"Greece or Italy, or any Mediterranean country for that matter, and see that maybe the diet doesn't exactly reflect this."
But in the period of 1960 this is what the Mediterranean diet traditio nally looked like.
"What do you notice, about this pyramid, that's different, than some of the other food guides, that you might have seen?"
"Well to start out with, if you look at the base, the base of this pyramid focuses on being physically active, and the notion of enjoying meals with one another."
"But there's certainly a pscyhological component, and the sharing of foods among family and friends, that's integral, to this lifestyle."
"The base of the pyramid, as it pertains to food, is focusing on fruits, grains, vegetables."
Mostly whole grains.
"And olive oil, beans, nuts, legumes, seeds, herbs, and spices."
There's a little bit of protein that comes from fish and seafood.
"And even less focus on poultry, eggs, cheese. and yogurt."
"At the top, in very limited amounts, you see meats and sweets."
"Notice over here, there's inclusion of wine and it says, in small print, but it's there, in moderation."
"There's also the encouragement to drink water, which is a nice way of saying don't drink sugary sweetened beverages."
One of the most interesting things about the Mediterranean Diet is that it's not a low-fat diet.
"Right, it's actually pretty moderate in fat intake, 25 to 35% of the total of the calories."
Saturated fat's comprises no more than seven to eight percent of the calories.
"So, it's pretty decent in fat, but the fat's don't come from butter and cheese and meat."
They come from monounsaturated fat.
"Things like olive oil, nuts, and seeds."
With just a tiny amount of animal foods included in a diet.
"These monounsaturated fats are not alone protective against cardiovascular disease, but in combination, the lifestyle factors plus the dietary components, are what researchers think is the primary reason why we see lower rates of heart disease in people who eat this way."
There also is inclusion in the Mediterranean diet on alcohol.
Alcohol may be cardio protective in two ways.
It helps to reduce clotting and it also slightly elevates your HDL
levels.
"Now if you don't drink alcohol, its not worth picking it up or starting to drink alcohol to get these benefits."
"But if you do drink alcohol, there is an incentive to drink in moderation."
"Moderation, in nutrition science, with regards to alcohol consumption is referred to as no more than one glass of wine per day for women, and one to two glasses of wine per day for men, or another alcoholic beverage."
"But the point is that it should be, limited to one glass or serving per day for females, and one to two per day for males."
"What does the research show about the Mediterranean diet and heart health outcomes, and how does the"
"Mediterranean diet which is not low in fat, compare to a low-fat diet?"
"If this is true, level-two parallel universes must exist."
Time goes on forever... and there's a continual process of birth of universes... through cosmic catastrophes.
In the level-three type... there is an even more fantastic way parallel universes can form.
Here's how it works.
"In both the level-one and level-two kinds... there are replica universes separated from us... in the here and now by time and space... but in the level-three parallel universe... these copies of us are right here, right now..."
living in the exact same space and time.
They are separated from us... because they're in a different dimension of this same space.
"And to bend our minds more, there are an infinite number of them."
"If true, this controversial ""many worlds"" concept... has monumental consequences."
Parallel universes don't exist.
- Right.
- They're nonsense.
"They're something out of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode... a bad ""Star Trek"" rerun."
But you forget one thing.
One small quantum difference could separate me... from an entirely different universe... where I have multiple copies of myself...
leading multiple different lives.
This is shocking.
This even affects morals.
"I mean, why should I obey the law... knowing that in some universe, if I commit a crime..."
I'm going to get away with it?
The outrageous idea comes from the strange world... of quantum mechanics... the science of the atom.
In the bizarre atomic world... we have electrons that literally disappear... reappear someplace else.
Electrons that could be multiple places at the same time.
This staggering quantum mechanical phenomenon... is enshrined in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
"As crazy as it sounds, not only does quantum physics... tell you that a little particle can be in two places at once... but the so-called Heisenberg uncertainty principle... tells you that sometime the particle... even must be in two places at once."
"With a laser light and a glass apple... it can be seen how light particles, or photons, do this."
This shows that photons... the little particles of light coming out of my laser... can end up in several places at once.
And since we are made of little particles... that means if they can be in several places at once... so can we.
"In other words, in the instant that you have a fleeting thought... your whole body makes a quantum leap... into another dimension and into a parallel universe."
And what it means is that if I am walking down the pavement... and just make a snap decision... as to whether I'm going to go left or right... if my decision depends... on what some little particle in my brain was doing... then I will actually end up doing both... and the life of mine- it effectively splits into two parallel realities.
In a level-three type parallel universe... even a cat has many more than nine lives.
"The trouble is, in some of these worlds... the cat could be dead."
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do.
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be.
So we focused on motion capture.
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture.
I'll give you an example here.
"It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard, and they put some reflective markers on your body, and instead of using cameras, there're infrared sensors around a volume, and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time."
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character.
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers.
"But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking, and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process."
"And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance."
That's not terribly compelling.
And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers.
We needed the subtleties of the skin.
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
"Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art."
So we aborted using motion capture.
"And we were now well out of our comfort zone, and in uncharted territory."
"So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling ""technology stew."""
We started to look out in other fields.
"The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging, the video game space, and re-appropriate them."
And we had to create kind of a sauce.
And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one.
"Initially, we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s."
"He believed that he could, in fact, catalog the human face."
"And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS."
"He believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face, and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing."
"And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender."
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour.
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face.
"It's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around us, are shaped by that stance."
We are social to the core.
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals.
This is a long time ago.
"And for them, autism was devastating."
They had profound intellectual disabilities.
They didn't talk.
"But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people."
"In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things."
But they're always doing things by themselves.
"So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere."
"Extremely, extremely isolated."
"Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you about."
These are survival skills.
"These are survival skills that we inherited over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution."
"You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility."
"Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival."
They orient to the caregiver.
"From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds, rather than just sounds in the environment."
"They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away."
"Well, they orient to the caregiver."
The caregiver seeks the baby.
"And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind -- the social mind, the social brain -- depends on."
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life.
It doesn't; it begins with the beginning of life.
"As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see it, but it's really critical."
And that thing is called attention.
"And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word, that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want."
"They also learn to follow other people's gazes, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about."
"And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue."
"They are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude."
Look at what the probability here is of the backscatter.
"Hey, that probability, we can calculate that."
"The probability is simply the number of backscattered particles, 20 (the count rate of the backscattered particles, 20), over the count rate of the incident number of particles, 132,000."
That probability is 2x10^-4.
"Not large, but not zero."
There is something coming off.
And Rutherford was amazed.
And what he wrote later on was that this experiment was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.
It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15 inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and bit you.
So how does he interpret that experiment?
"Well, what he said is that since most of these alpha particles went right through this foil to the detector, that must mean that those gold atoms that make up that gold foil must be mostly empty."
So the picture is that you've got this gold atom here.
"And he knew, roughly speaking, how large that gold atom was."
He knew it to be about 10^-10 meters.
"But what he was proposing is that these helium ions going through, these alpha particles are just going right through that volume because most of the atom, --"
"-- and he knew that there were electrons in this atom because he knew about the electrons already, most of that atom is empty."
"However, occasionally, once in a while, not very often but occasionally these helium ions, these alpha particles, what happened?"
"Well, occasionally they hit something very massive in that atom."
"And when it hit that massive part of the atom, it reflected, it scattered back into the direction from which it came."
"And from knowing what these scattering probabilities are and from knowing roughly the size of this atom and the thickness of the gold foil, he could calculate what the diameter of this nucleus was."
"And that number came out to be about 10^-14 meters, the diameter of this heavy massive part of the atom."
"Now, he called that massive part, he called it the nucleus."
He called it a nucleus in analogy to the massive center of a living cell.
That's where that name comes from.
"And this number of 10^-14 diameter, that's a good number to know, the relative size of the nucleus."
All MlT students should know that.
He also knew that that nucleus really had to be positively charged.
Why did it have to be positively charged?
"Well, because he knew that these atoms were neutral, he knew already that an electron was part of an atom."
And so this nucleus had to be positively charged.
"And, in addition, he made some very sophisticated measurements of the angular distribution of the backscattered alpha particles."
"And from those measurements of the angular distribution, he was able to back out the fact that this nucleus had a charge of plus Z, where Z is the atomic number, times unit charge e."
"It's gotten $2,000 more expensive off of $20,000, so it's gotten 10% more expensive."
"You, as the economist, what you would say is, as the way you've defined it, your consumer price index, and this is abbreviated with CPl, consumer price index, your consumer price index is up by 10%."
"Or another way, based on the way you measured it, and it changes from country to country, and even within countries, they change the way that they do these basket of goods, but by the way you've measured it, you would say that price inflation, or, you would say that the price inflation has been 10% between year 1 and year 5, or in general everything got 10% more expensive, or you would need 10% more money to have the same standard of living."
"In general, when people are just referring to inflation, so if you just see the word ""inflation"" being referred to, especially in modern times, they are referring to price inflation."
"This general increase in the price of goods and services, measured by some type of basket of goods."
"There is another type of inflation, and that is monetary inflation."
Monetary inflation; and they are related.
Monetary inflation is inflation due purely to an increase of the money supply.
This is increase in money supply.
"In general, if this increase in the money supply does outstrip the productive capacity of the country, it could very well lead to price inflation, but in general what people measure, when they talk about inflation, from one year to the next, they're talking about this basket of goods."
They're talking about price inflation.
"The other thing that you'll sometimes see, maybe in year 5, someone says,"
"""Hey; I could sell you this house,"" so this is in year 5,"
"""I could sell you a house,"
"""and this house in year 5 is $660,000."""
"Is $660,000."
"Someone might ask, what would be that price if we adjusted it for inflation in year 1 dollars?"
"What they're saying is, if you adjust for how much value your money has lost, because if things are getting more expensive, that means each dollar is being worth less."
You can buy less with each dollar.
"When people say, ""How much is that,"
"""adjusted for inflation in year 1 money?"" you're essentially saying,"
"""What amount of money would that house"
"""have had to cost in year 1,"
"""that when you adjust it for inflation,"
"""when you increase it by 10%,"" so that's the same thing; increasing by 10% is the same thing as multiplying by 110%, or multiplying by 1.1, so, ""what amount of money would that house"
"""had to have cost in year 1,"
"""that if I multiply it by 1.1,"
"""I get $660,000?"""
"We could do a little bit of quick math here, to figure that out."
"If we say, let's say that, I don't know,"
let's call it P.
P is the price of the house in year 1.
"So here's an example of a shower stall that has multiple showerheads in it, multiple faucets."
So that water demand is often increased in bathrooms designed
like this.
Most green building programs also attempt to regulate the building materials that are used in furnishings.
So here's an example of a bookcase and set of drawers that seemingly are made out of oak.
But this is actually an oak veneer.
"And if you have been up in Kroon Hall where the Forestry and Environmental Studies School is, you may know that about seventy percent of the wood that's on the interior of this was grown on Yale property, on Yale forests."
"It also is red oak, but it's solid red oak."
It's not a veneer.
So what's beneath the veneer?
Here you can see a strip of pressboard that is faced with a white oak surface.
But the interior is basically low-grade wood chips of a variety of different species that are compressed together and they are mixed up in liquid form with adhesives and then they are rolled out in a strip and then cut into a variety of different sizes.
The adhesives have compounds that are often proprietary and even unknown to most who purchase them or sell them at building supply houses.
"They commonly contain adhesives that are epoxy resins, some of which contain bisphenol-A that we talked about earlier in the course."
But also formaldehyde is a component that is commonly used that is an allergen and it's a suspected carcinogen.
I'd like you to think too about the problem of your understanding.
How could you increase your understanding of the energy intensity of your own lifestyle?
"Well, here's a pretty good example of the way that houses that were built in the 1990s and previously are metered."
"So that this is at your utility junction box, where the line comes in from the road."
This is my meter.
I have the same brand.
And it's got five dials on it.
"And you might think, well that's not that tough to figure out."
"But if you walk up to it, you'll see that the dials actually have the numbers that on the first dial on the left, it goes from lowest to highest in a clockwise motion."
But in the second it goes from lowest to highest in a counterclockwise motion.
So they switch on as you move across the screen.
So this is actually a very difficult thing to keep track of.
"Now also, you might wonder well, how would I find out how my variance in behavior, how I manage my computers or my"
"lights or my water consumption, or how big a refrigerator I have, how is that going to affect my electric bill?"
It's really hard to figure it out given this kind of a metering system.
"Because if you can decipher what the meter says, you'll only get a total figure for your consumption."
"Now, this has created an opportunity for people to design a variety of smart meters that keep track of energy intake and use and how it's distributed in a house for different purposes."
Rising food prices limits people's access to food.
"And years of intensive chemical farming has destroyed lands, affecting the viability of future harvests."
What can we do to GROW?
Let's GROW our own movement here in Southeast Asia.
We can help women empower themselves so that they can have better access to produce food ... for their families and communities.
The FAO estimates that if women had the same access to productive resources as men ... yields can increase by 20 to 30%.
We can do this by supporting communities and peoples affected by land grabbing ... especially those who are pushed off by giant corporations.
We should call on government and companies to put a stop to land grabbing.
As individuals and groups ... we can push for regulation to help ensure that investments also benefit and do not harm communities.
We can also push for a global climate deal that demand huge emission cuts from developed countries.
Developed countries should also provide technology and finance ... to support adaptation projects of communities in the region.
We can call on governments in the region to invest in sustainable agricultural production using the communities local knowledge.
"We can buy and consume locally produced food ... to also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, normally produced in shipping food."
We can plant and GROW our-own seed now.
"For food, livelihood, community and the planet."
"Dear Athletes, I am glad to welcome you here at the capital city of lower Austria"
Lots of you have been here in the last years the know the awsome track the organizators have done their best - and they invented some new goodies the ironkids and the expo is now situated in the city center
"I hope, that beside the ironman event you will find some time to visit the town center and the whole region"
"I wish all the best, an awsome Im 70.3 and a good time in St. Pölten"
Dear Athletes of the IM 70.3 in St. Pölten
The orga welcomes you we wish a pleasant time and all the best for the race we hope to see you again next year
"Honestly, I didn't expect there will be so many of you, and I don't mean here particularly, I mean here altogether."
"I've been living thinking that there are 6 billion of us on this planet, it turns out there are more than 7 billion of us here already."
"Yet, you know, many surveys and popular sentiment suggest people feel more and more isolated, more and more lonely, more and more depressed, or just bored."
"Which made me wonder: how many people, out of those 7 billion, can one actually have meaningful relationships with?"
"I'm not talking here about the illusion created by Facebook or Twitter,"
I mean like real friendships.
If I can just ask you to think and count: how many real friends do you think you have?
How many people can you have a long and interesting conversation with?
"Or, how many people would you invite and would like to see for your birthday?"
"Or, how many people in unfortunate circumstances would show up in the hospital?"
It turns out there is a number
"What true capitalism does is rewards people who are productive; people who work a lot of hours, people who have a lot of talent, people who come up with good ideas, they get big rewards under capitalism, and people who don't do those sorts of things get less."
The one negative one might be concerned about is that some people have very little skill.
"They are not able to earn very much left on their own, and so very reasonable people support some antipoverty spending."
"But that's completely different than interfering with capitalism, regulating prices, limiting quantities, opposing all sorts of things on businesses."
"Those make the economy less productive, give us a smaller pie, and make it even harder for us to operate programs that help those who are less fortunate and because they were unlucky."
The third myth is that capitalism was responsible for the recent financial crisis and the recession.
"That, again, is almost exactly the opposite of what is true."
"First of all, nobody who's being intellectually honest thinks that we had unbridled, serious capitalism before the crisis hit, before the subprime buildup occurred, before we had all the housing problems."
"We had enormous government interventions that subsidized risk, enormous government interventions that encouraged an over investment in housing."
"If one's going to try to draw any conclusions, it seems to suggest much more clearly that interfering with capitalism generates financial crises, generates recessions, because what we experienced was directly related to the incentives for excessive risk taking, the incentives for over investment of housing that were created by government."
"The private sector responded to those incentives, so of course the private sector can't be completely absolved of being involved."
"But in the sense of causing, it was the bad policies that caused it not what the private sector or capitalism did on its own."
"Most importantly, whenever government bailout people who took excessive risk, they encourage people to do more of that in the future, and we unfortunately went a huge way in that direction via the TARP and via all the federal reserve policies, which helped Wall Street and the risk takers not have to pay the true price for all of the excessive risk taking they engaged in."

The embedded tack was then cut and polished.
"To determine the tack's composition, it was analyzed using an x-ray technique known as X-ray fluorescence or XRF."
The XRF instrument creates a spectrum with each line representing a different chemical element.
"The spectrum showed that the tack was made of brass, but also contained significant traces of other metals."
"Such impure brass was commonplace in the 1500s, but not in more recent times."
"Next, to determine how the tack was made it was examined under an optical microscope."
"Getty scientists observed that the tack had a very even and rounded crystal structure, which indicated that the metal was cast into a mold and then allowed to cool naturally."
A common working method in the 1500s.
"A tack that had been made more recently, would probably have been hammered or stamped resulting in a very different crystal structure."
The microscope also revealed an interesting layer on the surface of the tack.
"To identify the composition of this surface coating, a scanning electron microscope was used."
The upper layer was targeted and analyzed with an electron beam.
The spectrum produced by the microscope showed that the layer was primarily composed of the element tin.
"As you can see in this replica, the thin layer of tin was used to imitate the shiny appearance of silver."
"These discoveries about the manufacture and chemical composition of the tacks, enabled Getty scientists to conclude that they are authentic and date back to the fabrication of the cabinet in 1580."
What's the most important issue  to you this election season?
"You know, the most important issue to me is  really the economic disparity."
"I have a lot of concern that the rich keep getting richer,  and the poor keep getting poorer, and I really think we need a big overhaul  to change what's happening in our country."
Do you think the political system is broken?
"If so, how would you fix it?"
"You know, I do a little bit,"
I think the way that I see it as broken is that we have a lot of political backing by donors who can afford to back the politicians.
"And, so, I don't know that I see it as equal representation, and so I think if there was some way we could make our system be more about an equal - starting at an equal base."
Okay?
So each - each party had an equal amount to spend we would have a little more equality in terms of the voices and the issues that we heard.
Are you hopeful about the future?
I am hopeful.
"I do think we need some changes, and that I don't necessarily mean changes in presidency, but we need some changes in the whole system."
But I'm always hopeful; I'm always hopeful.
"I think we have a great country, and I think people have their hearts in the right places."
"Let's do this again,using once again our election example."
"This time with four parties--A, B, C, and D."

"They come one by one, all seeking answers to puzzling questions and ways of coping with the uncertainties and challenges that life can bring."
"Almost universally, they leave with new optimism and new tools to help them deal with the issues of concern."
They are people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or the parents of children with disabilities and most have felt the frustration and pain of struggling to deal with the system.
These individuals have come to Partners in Policymaking and their needs and circumstances vary.
But all have sought ways to find new answers and to bring about change.
They learn how to make their voices heard to play a role in policy development.
"Wanda Mills has lived with difficult disabilities for much of her life, but persevered and went on to employment with the tax department in the town of Sylva"
"When her parents passed on, she moved to her own residence, cooks all her own meals and maintains the household."
She credits the Partners program with helping her to interact in the community.
It has changed my life completely.
"I have always wanted to be a public speaker. and that was a crazy idea, but Partners helped me realize that I could be a public speaker."
That has always been a life dream of mine.
"From my perspective, it is to help parents of children with disabilities to not put their child in a box, but let them be all they can be, however little though that may be."
That is so important.
[male voice]
Wanda is increasingly speaking out on issues of concern to people with disabilities addressing groups in a number of North Carolina communities.
"The Partners program director,"
"Deborah Whitfield, an attorney who herself is a graduate of the program in Texas understands the growth process and now keeps the proceedings on track in North Carolina."
"There are some challenges, people who believe, that you know they can't do it because many of them haven't left their own communities."
Many have never gotten on public transportation.
Many have not even lived in a hotel room.
"So when you see those individuals who come to this training for the first time, get that experience and soar it is a delight to be a part of that process."
[male voice]
"The creator of the Partners advocacy program, Dr. Colleen Wieck, of Minnesota, said it was prompted by a specific need and then grew from there."
"The last witness at the 3-hour hearing was a young parent from International Falls,"
Minnesota.
"And, everyone was giving her mixed messages about what to do to testify in front of U.S. Senator Dave Durenberger"
"And, after that hearing, two of us got together and we realized, we could teach the skill that was missing."
"And, we could do this in a systematic way, as well as teach best practices about disability services."
"And, as a result, we created this eight weekend program that's designed to teach both- what is best practice in education, assistive technology, living and employment, as well as how to communicate with local, state and federal officials."
"And we can see some increase: you can see in the top that there's some norepinephrine activity, some of the serotonin 2C activity that we highlight could increase some norepinephrine and dopamine."
"So if you think about some of those initial symptom comparisons we talked about,"
"Fluoxetine is a little more activating, may help a little more with concentration, may be helpful in some of the sedated and fatigued patients."
"With its long half-life and active metabolite, though, it might not be great for the elderly."
"There are a lot of drug interactions, though, with Fluoxetine, both with the Fluoxetine and the active metabolite."
"So you have to be careful with using the drug, in terms of drug interaction monitoring."
"The next agent we'll talk about is Paroxetine, and there are multiple formulations, again:"
"Paxil, Paxil CR, and Paroxetine."
Paxil versus Paxil CR: the only difference is that the CR is better upon initiation.
Paxil's a little difficult to start.
It's very hard to get on and off of this drug.
"So, the CR has a little bit different absorption, and so it absorbs lower in the stomach, rather than in the stomach, more in the intestine, so you don't get as much nausea with the drug."
"And so you do some slight dosage adjustments, but there's no benefit of Paxil CR over Paxil or Paroxetine after the first two weeks of treatment."
"So, again, we don't really see anything in terms of the use of this agent."
The dose of Paroxetine is anywhere from ten to eighty milligrams.
"Again, multiple indications:"
"Major Depression,"
"Obsessive-Compulsive, Panic, Social Anxiety Disorder,"
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,"
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder."
"As we talk about some of the other anti-depressants, you may not see as long of lists of indications, which is fine, it doesn't make any one drug more superior to another when they have more indications."
It's just what that particular manufacturer decided to study and gain FDA approval for.
But it doesn't make a drug better or worse than another.
"That doesn't make a drug that's not indicated for something that we can't use it for something, potentially."
"Some of the unique aspects of Paroxetine is it does have a very short half-life, so we have to be careful with withdrawal."
Withdrawal can occur by missing one dose of this medicine.
"And the withdrawal is something like a flu-like symptom, flu-like phenomenon, so people get very nauseous, sweaty, they may feel a little off-balance, they may have some reality distortion, often, too."
"So you have to be careful with this one, with someone with compliance issues and forgetting to take their medicine."
"This is probably the more sedating, calming agent, so it's better with patients who have insomnia, they might see a little actual fatigue."
"We do see some anticholinergic side effects, though with Paroxetine: the dry mouth, sedation, constipation."
"And we can see waking, clinically, with Paroxetine also."
"Across the board, most of the antidepressants are weight-neutral."
We have another question coming in.
"Do we look at ways to talk about our work as place-based, because it often is?"
Arley:
I'll let Mark take that one because I know he's well versed in place-based.
Mark: that's a great question and I think that there's even language in the budget request talking about how we can look at CSBG work as place based.
Let me read you this quote specifically from the budget justification.
"""The purposes and goals of the Community Services Block Grant focus on strengthening communities and reducing poverty by using a broad range of federal, state, and local resources."
"Just as place-based efforts leverage investments by focusing resources in targeted places and draw on the compounding effect of cooperative arrangement""."
So clearly this is the work that Community Action is doing.
Part of it is messaging and talking about our work that is place-based but also looking at how we can collaborate and cooperate with other efforts the administration is specifically picking out as our place-based initiative.
"There are things like Community Action that are ongoing that are place based, but the administration has a couple of favored projects that they're working on."
There's a number of place- based things that they're doing that are even serving the same populations of people that the
Community Action is serving we need to look at how we can collaborate with better.
Brad:
Very good answer.
Let me just remind our audience we're in the final 15 minutes of the webinar.
If you do have any questions or if you have a comment to make on any of the issues that we've discussed please go ahead and enter the little chat function now and send us your question or comment.
We had several people write in about the audio.
It will be available at the end of this week on the NASCSP website.
"It will be prominently noted on the homepage of the website, so you will be able to quickly get to it."
We thank you for your patience.
I apologize to anyone who experienced audio problems.
We understand some folks at the beginning of the webinar did have some audio issues and we hope that they resolved.
"Now we have a question here regarding the performance of the CSBG program, and Arley this gets into a subjective area as to the national performance of the program based on funding received."
Are we performing well in terms of numbers and outcomes recorded on the national level?
"Is the problem quantity of services clients"" outcomes?"
Or is it that we are not reporting on the right things?
Arley:
"I think that that's a very good question, and I'll start it and I'll let Mark finish it."
When CSBG was turned into a block grant it was envisioned to be 50 experiments in the country.
50 programs that all
look different that are based upon the needs of that particular state or that particular area.
And that's M-theory.
M-theory explains how the tiniest... as well as the biggest things in the cosmos work.
It also proposes that we all live on a giant and energetic membrane.
Our universe is tethered to this wall by invisible extra dimensions.
"To make matters crazier, M-theory proposes... that six or seven of these dimensions... the extra ones we don't sense every day... are tiny and right in front of your nose."
"At every point of any one of these people walking by... you pick a point, at that point... there will be an incredibly tiny, curled-up... either six or seven dimensions that you just don't perceive."
These membranes are also very close to each other.
You could have one of these membranes being a universe.
"And then, moving sideways... you have another membrane being a separate universe... and they may be just a millimeter or two away."
The giant walls of energetic matter float side by side...
like humongous sheets in the bulk or in hyperspace.
An entire universe may be attached to a brane... or a universe can occupy the whole of another one.
"Our own universe sits on the skin of one of these giant branes... that, in turn, is adrift in the cosmic sea of space."
And it's floating around in a bigger structure called the bulk.
Our three-dimensional universe is like a membrane... floating around within this larger structure.
"Believing that invisible extra dimensions... that, like an umbilical cord, connect us... to a hyper or bulk space where giant membranes live... demands a huge leap of faith."
Where are these membranes that we're stuck to?
And why can't we see these extra dimensions that connect us?
I'm floating around here on this kayak on the surface of the ocean... and you can think of this as a two-dimensional surface.
"But below me, there's a whole 'nother dimension."
There's the down dimension where all the fish live.
You can think of that as the bulk.
"I'm on a membrane, floating around... and the bulk is the other dimension."
The fish down below the surface of the water... are in a different dimension than I am.
They don't even know that I'm here... unless I happen to splash around and hit one on the head... or something like that.
So they might be completely oblivious to my existence... and I could be oblivious to their existence... because we're in different dimensions.
But can a fleeting thought send you into an extra dimension... and on to a parallel universe?
"According to the latest M-theory, in less than an instant... in the first trillionth of a trillionth of a second... membranes in a pre-universe cosmos, like gigantic cosmic cymbals... smashed together and produced the Big Bang."
Over almost 13.7 billion years... a huge expanding bubble of primordial matter... evolved into the universe we now know and love.
"Can crashing membranes create parallel universes, too?"
"If it happened once, it can happen again... and again and again."
So it's possible that there's a continuous cycle... of branes smashing together to produce universes... and that it never stops.
"It's important to know these things because we need to work with the best energies, but we should never despise any energy generated by any chakra, because they are all always working, with greater intensity or less intensity."
"And you may even know the level of evolution of a person by knowing in which chakra they are working most of time, that means, with their emotions, their feelings, their individual productions."
"It's important to know, but this is not the time to talk about it, which would be exactly the spiritual evolution of the individual. this will not be discussed."
Now I'm just talking about the energies and these energies are catched by our chakras and exteriorized to the environment.
"Well, that's an important thing for us to know, because we can not make up stories about it."
"All people ... there is no one on the planet who does not do this: you receive energy, one part stays with you and the other part you exteriorize in the environment."
"The part that stays with you is exactly the one that makes you perform, work, is your fuel, end the part which you exteriorize in the environment is the surplus of energies, because you are constantly capturing energy and constantly exteriorizing energy, furthermore you are using part of that energy."
"So, think of one thing: for every thought you are emanating, depending on thought, a mental energy."
"If you are, for example, imagining things, you will be working with the energies of the frontal chakra."
"If you are very emotional, you will already be working with the emotional chakras and then you will be producing emotional energies."
That's why we say very frequently:
"""Wow, I got so excited!"
"It was such a happy moment, I was deeply touched! "" gives the impression that we are doing something that is fantastic, but it is not."
Why it is not fantastic?
"Because the moment you get emotional, you work with the lower chakras, you are producing dense and unhealthy energies."
And may you think:
"""Gosh, I'll always have to keep my energy in a higher level?"""
"Look, this thing of keep the energy in a higher level, sounds like an effort, but you simply have to ""be"" and you will not make any effort to produce the best energies."
The best energies are produced when we are enlightened and this enlightenment allows us to make our life a linear life in terms of response to the environment.
"The environmental stimuli can become emotional responses or they can only become responses from the chakra of feeling (heart chakra), this way responses are very different and much more realistic."
So let's learn more about energy.
"And to learn more about energy, you could do some experiments."
"Start by experimenting, for example with plants."
Put your hands near the plants and try to feel what happens.
That's nice.
You will try to feel.
"Any variation of energy you feel, would be a good to note down."
Put your hand on the earth and try to feel earth's energy.
It's another good experiment.
Do you know another great experiment?
Put your hand into the cold water.
"Feel, feel it."
What is this conspiracy?
What is the truth?
There must be a fair account of it.
"It is a stultifying policy if politics is only defined by the powers-that-be, if history is interpreted with only one side of the story given."
Justice must be upheld and the dignity of citizens must be defended.
This is also the basis on which Function 8 was formed.
"Among the founders of F8, a few are ex-detainees of the 87 ""Operation Spectrum""."
"Needless to say, we too would like to close the chapter as far as the 87 incident is concerned."
"However, the one who created the problem should be the one to solve it."
"We might have been treated unfairly, but we are fully aware that we are not the only ones who have become victims of the ISA."
"There have been different magnitudes of arrest involving hundreds of people ever since the notorious ""Operation Cold Store"" in 1963."
The torture and humiliation suffered by those detainees were even more unbearable compared to those endured by us.
Many of them were kept away for decades for defending justice and defying violence unleashed on them.
But they continued to stand their ground and contribute to society in the way they see fit.
These are the citizens deserving our respect and admiration.
"The year 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of ""Operation Cold Store""."
We ought to remember those who symbolize our social conscience and those who live in exile not of their own accord.
We look forward to the day when they can come back to their homeland without any fear or recrimination.
Singapore will be for the richer in terms of vigour and wealth if that happens!
Thank you!
"Thank you very much! and most of the speakers have spoken in English and will be in English, I would like"
"Now that we've laid out the possible role for government as viewed by economists, it's worth looking at some policies that people have thought about and some of which have been tried particularly for adults when it comes to affecting behaviors that are related to obesity."
"And as a brief outline, we're going to talk about policies aimed at adults, We're going to mention policies aimed at children, and then we're going to conclude this lecture talking about some private sector initiatives that also might be influencing the behavior of individuals with respect to food choices and obesity."
So here's a list of different policies that we've thought about and that have been aimed at adults.
A change in the farm subsidy policy.
"Obviously that wouldn't be just adults, that effects everybody who consumes food in the United States."
Food stamps.
"Clearly that would also affect children because there are many families that are on food stamps, not just adults."
"Medicare, that seemed largely in older adults, things about neighborhoods,"
"That would effect children as well potentially, labeling,"
That's going to affect children as much as their behavior is shaped by what their parents choose.
"And fat tax issues again, might affect,"
"The second reason we do it is to impose some structure on the course, including deadlines, to provide you with some additional motivation to work through all the topics."
Deadlines also have a very important side effect that synchronizes a lot of the students in the class.
And this of course makes the course discussion forum a far more effective tool for students to seek and provide help in understanding the course material.
"The final reason that we give homeworks is to satisfy those of you who, on top of learning the course material, are looking to challenge yourself intellectually."
[sound].
"Now, this class has tens of thousands of students."
So it's obviously essential that the assignments can be graded automatically.
"Now, we're currently only in the 1.0 generation of free online courses such as this one."
So the available tools for auto graded assessment are currently rather primitive.
"So, we'll do the best we can, but I have to be honest with you."
"It's difficult, or maybe even impossible to test deep understanding of the design and analysis of algorithms, using the current set of tools."
"Thus, while the lecture content in this online course is in no way watered down from the original Stanford version."
"The required assignments and exams we'll give you, are not as demanding as those that are given in the on campus version of the course."
"To make up for this fact, we'll occasionally propose optional algorithm design problems, either in a video or via supplementary assignment."
"We don't have the ability to grade these, but we hope that you'll find them interesting and challenging, and that you'll discuss possible solutions with other students via the course discussion forum."
So I hope this discussion answered most of the questions you have about the course.
"Lets move on to the real reason that we're all here, to learn more about algorithms."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
GAETJEN:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much for the warm welcome.
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
"My name is Steven Gaetjen, and I will be your host for today's closing keynote of the International IFA Keynote Program."
Great to have you all here.
I hope you're well and are ready to get started.
"This is a very special keynote that we have today, not only because we have one of the most important IT managers worldwide; the Chairman and CEO of Google, Dr. Eric Schmidt here as a guest on stage, but also because we will give you the chance to ask questions at the end of the keynote, an especially designed"
Q&amp;amp;A section for you.
"So, there are a couple of things that I would like you to keep in mind."
"First of all, dear photographers, welcome, great to have you here."
"We know that you want to take the best pictures as possible and we do want you to get the best pictures as possible, but please keep your activity to three to four minutes once Mr. Schmidt has entered the stage."
Thank you very much.
"Number two, just to have a smooth, nice, fun and exciting keynote and Q&amp;amp;A section, please turn off your cell phones."
Letting go of the negative emotions and generating the positive ones.
Compassion is a positive emotion.
"It's not just something you talk about, and just throw that word out ""compassion""."
"Yeah, we all know we should be compassionate."
"And I'm sure at the Dalai Lama's talk everyone's saying ""yeah we should all be compassionate""."
"But then afterwards when somebody cut in front of them in the traffic jam - ""You stupid..!"
"You shouldn't do this!""."
"We have to actually act compassionately, be compassionate, generate this positive emotion."
"This is actually how we do this, you know, through our mindfulness, and our care and our understanding of life, we realise that whatever we're faced with in life, that's result of old kamma, what's the kamma we're doing now?"
"By generating this beautiful allowing this moment to be, respecting this moment, but being kind to it, being gentle, we are actually developing these positive wonderful emotions, of respect, of gratitude, allowing things to be, compassion, even inspiration."
What a beautiful emotion inspiration is.
When somebody says something or does something and it just raises your heart and gives you happiness for hours sometimes days sometimes years.
These are the emotions we should be developing.
"Imagine if we were a nation, a world, which ran more on inspiration rather than its opposite, desperation."
"Inspiration, it uplifts us and gives us energy, because the positive emotions empower you to do something really worthwhile in this world."
"The negative emotions - anger, fear, depression, grief, what does that do - that immobilises you."
"Anger sometimes gives you some energy, but it usually just wears you out after a while."
You can't do anything in this world - you can't do things.
"The positive emotions give you power, and open the path to achievement, achieving something really worthwhile in this world."
"Things like love, compassion, they're not something which is your birthright."
"You develop these, you train for these things."
"Just like an Olympic athlete, you train and train and train, by guarding your mind, changing the outlook, making good kamma, mental kamma, with whatever you have to deal with in life."
Allow it to be.
"Be kind, be gentle."
"When you create this beautiful kindness and gentleness, this wisdom this compassion grows and grows in you."
This is not just in your life.
"Even in that book which I wrote, ""Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond"", I made an important point even in meditation."
"Successful meditators are those who have an understanding of their emotional world, because even the path of meditation is an emotional path."
Very early on you have to suspend your intellectual thinking and feel your way through the path of peace.
To allow that peace to develop into the amazing emotions which sometimes you get in deep meditation.
"There's so much joy and happiness, and why does that come from?"
"Because you're grateful just to be in this moment, no fault-finding, so gentle to every breath, to every mind-moment"
"A couple more things about sick day management for diabetes, if you feel that you are dehydrated, and usually you know you're dehydrated if you look at the color of your urine, the closer it is to dark yellow or orange."
Amber colored urine implies that you're very dehydrated.
"Drink things like water, club soda, diet soda that's caffeine-free or even you can drink salty beverages like tomato juice or chicken broth when you're sick."
"If your blood sugar is low and you're sick, make sure that those drinks that you're drinking include some sugar."
So drink 100 percent juices or sports drinks.
"It's okay to drink regular soda but you want to stay away from the caffeinated ones or try tea with, With honey for a little bit of carbohydrate, plus your fluids."
"If you are interested in learning more about some basic meal planning tips for people that have diabetes, please check out some of these websites and articles that you see listed here."
VlKTORlA KOLESNlKOVA:
"One of the myths, I think, concerns the financial side."
"There is a conception, or a perception, I guess, that"
United States education is quite expensive and is not affordable and out of reach for many students.
"So the two-year college system actually helps to dispel that myth by providing outstanding opportunities to cut the cost of the bachelor's degree in half, at least."
"So most two-year community colleges would cost between $5,000 and $7,000 a year."
"And Foothill and De Anza colleges right now are about $5,300 for a whole year of tuition."
"And while you're studying there for two years, you're completing for same courses of major U.S. Universities, particularly those that are on our articulation agreements -- for example, UC Berkeley -- or even private instutitions,"
"like University of Southern California and Pepperdine, St."
"Mary's, for example, or Santa Clara."
And you're not paying their tuition for the first two years.
"So when you transfer, you receive course credit."
But you've saved the difference on the costs.
And another interesting characteristic is that there are more scholarships available between second and third year while you can already establish your academic performance.
"You participate in extracurricular activites, which are plentiful at many college campuses."
You can build up your resume.
And you already appear as a well-rounded student with significant experience studying in an American insitution.
And you are then able to receive more partial and sometimes full scholarships.
"It actually provides a wonderful opportunity for a student to get a bachelor's degree, sometimes from a very prestigious university, while not having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars."
So that's probably one of the most important myths that I hear.
PAUL McVElGH:
It's true that community colleges in the
United States are both technical and vocational kinds of institutions.
But the big difference from the typical community college in other countries is that they also have the transfer capacity.
"That was one group, then we had this very large engineering group building the Netscape navigator product."
"And in there Chofmann was there,"
"Johnny was there,"
"Jonas was there,"
Dbaron was there...
Dbaron came actually a little later.
But there is a bunch of people here in that engineering group.
That went on for a little while and it turned out to be not stable.
It turned out that the efforts of the Netscape management group to build the product to make money for them came into conflict with how we wanted to manage the code base as a Mozilla open source project.
That conflict simmered for a while and eventually it exploded.
"Yes, please feel free to ask questions at any point."
[Question]
"No, it turned out there are lots of ways to build a browser that makes money that people don't like."
"So in those days, Netscape had been acquired by AOL and AOL was a website property."
"So to that management team, the browser was a tool to drive people to the AOL website."
"You can do that, but it doesn't mean you like the product."
"You can add user interface features to it, you can focus on new buttons and menu items that in those cases were AOL specific, you can put your resources there rather than on security and new features, you might not be interested in features that help people find things across the web, because AOL wanted them going to AOL."
"So we found that there were immense conflicts and also, in an open source project, you have contributors who have an ""ownership stake"", meaning that they put effort in, they are building a product, if they are using the product they have a set of needs that might be different."
"As part of the open source project we were balancing the needs of our employers, Netscape, with various other people."
"And eventually,"
that broke down.
"So for example, we'll take user interface which is always a contentious issue in a product."
"The single most contentious issue, way back in 1999 and 2000, was user interface, because Netscape would want a user interface that drove people to AOL and Mozilla wanted an interface that was good for people using the Web."
I was the General Manager of the small group of people building Mozilla as an open source project.
In those days we called ourselves staff@mozilla.org or mozilla.org staff.
"When the tension exploded over the interface, over really who controlled the code, we had long fights about what would the basic process is by which we build the product."
"So things we take for granted today,"
"like you have to earn the right to be a committer, we fought with Netscape over that."
"Things like code needs code review, it has to be good enough; that being hired as an employee doesn't automatically make your code good enough; that even after you are hired as an employee your peers need to decide your code is good enough."
So basic things like code review were immense fights.
"I was the representative of Mozilla and when those tensions came to a head,"
I was fired.
So you have to cut through the fog.
And this particular publication does a good job of describing how you might do that.
So here are.
"The NlST guidelines and then mapping them to an event that we held here couple of years ago to gain the attention of business and computing and community leaders in the city of Seattle, that really did not know or were aware of cyber-security issues."
"The message that we wanted to get across was the alarming vulnerability of public and private information on networks, if they are compromised."
The outcomes we wanted is to gain attention and to influence legislation.
In fact.
The Attorney General who was brand new to his position at that time.
Actually was enthused about this event and afterwards did quite a bit to make.
Cyber crime.
A factor in his agenda as attorney general.
And he was successful in passing some legislation that was landmark.
"For example, a cyber stalking statute, the first in the country."
As a result of some problems that the city of Seattle had experienced.
"And then you want to make sure that the, there is an awareness of roles and responsibilities."
So at the event summation after we had the training we focused on who is going to do what and what peoples' relative responsibilities were for identity theft.
Largely the care and feeding about own information that's out there on networks and various systems ends up being our responsibility.
Once we turn it over to a third party.
It's their's.
"And there are many agreements you, you might want to look at the service level agreement for Facebook for example, that discusses how your personal information will be managed."
"And so when you give your information to a third party, just assume you've lost control."
"So, as far as security's awareness training is concerned, it's a process of educating people."
"You want to wake them up to the risks and vulnerabilities they face, you want to talk about the tools that can minimize those risks, and you want them to understand that the company has a mechanism in place to keep people's knowledge current."
"So, those are the kinds of things you want to get across."
"So, let's look at this Google hacking event, it was an interesting training experience."
Here's the problem.
"We'll, we recognize as a community at cyber-security experts, when I say we, we have a group that meets on quarterly basis that stays current on trends in cyber-security threats and the vulnerabilities that they attack."
"And so, we are aware that there is a growing problem in the community around identity theft We knew that one in twenty"
Americans suffer from identity theft as victims every year.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are impacted in the economy.
"Most institutions will cover this as a part of doing business, although that is beginning to change."
"So consumers are coping with covering charges if they're not covered by an insurance policy of a certain amount, which can be significant."
Which focuses on educational games and simulation.

"Students in the games and simulation will be able to achieve and get a better knowledge for future career opportunity, such as..."
Some of the required courses you can take include the following...
"In general, this is some of the course you may also be taking by obtaining a degree in IDT..."
Several elective of courses you may also be taking...
All IDT courses take place in Horriban Hall.
"Horriban Hall house some great facilities use by IDT students include computer lab, photo lab, and an electronic classroom."
"The computer lab where most of the IDT cources take place consist of Mac and Windows with the latest technologies and software such as Adobe Creative Master Collection,"
"Final Cut Studio, Strata 3-D Animation, Maya, and Lectora Authoring System."
"The photo lab consist of some of the most entertaining and fun tool for developing, taking and producing pictures."
"The students have the opportunity to develop black and white photography, as well as, color photography."
Within this department students may also check-out professional equipment for their use through the technology resource check-out.
"Hello, Instruction Design and Technology department offers a wide range of different software and media devises that allow us as professors to teach in a much more efficient manor and provide a better education to our students in the classroom, as well as, our students taking online course."
This allows us to teach effectively while introducing the latest in learning technology to our students.

"That's according to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan, who tells Gamereactor that more games would be unveiled at Gamescom in August.\par \par He explains:"
"""At the event in New York on"
"February 20 of this year, we showed a lot of software."
We showed a lot of first-party software.
"What we did at E3 here was really show some updates to those games, and, as you mentioned, introduce The Order:"
1886.
There\rquote s a lot coming.\rdblquote\par \par SCE Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida says his studios have 30 games in development.
"Apparently, 20 of them are going to ship within the first year of the console\rquote s life, and of those, 12 are new IP, or brand new games.\par \par"
Ryan continues:
"""So there\rquote s a lot going on, it\rquote s just that we need to keep stuff back."
"We\rquote ve got Gamescom for us Europeans\emdash we need to have something to show at Gamescom, don\rquote t we?""\par \par"
"While the PlayStation 4 does not have a release date, yet, it is expected to be released later this year.\par \par"
"The first-party exclusives we know of at the moment for the PS4 are DriveClub, Knack, Killzone:"
"Shadow Fall, Infamous:"
"So they, they, they, they are connected to some extent."
"So, that's the baseline approach."
The next one is the detailed analysis approach.
This one is a
little bit more in depth.
"So, what you're going to do here is an in depth analysis and identification of assets, and assessment of the threat levels against those assets, and associated vulnerabilities."
"So, this is more a more comprehensive approach similar to what we talked about earlier with that three step flow."
The security level appropriate for the security need is identified using this approach.
"So, rather than setting a baseline and then comparing everything against the baseline, this focuses on a specific combination of threat, vulnerability, asset, and consequence."
The next one is a combined approach which combines the baseline and detailed analysis.
"What you do here is that, primarily, focus this approach high risk exposures."
"And, you would do a detailed analysis of the high risk areas, and then use the baseline approach on everyth ing else."
"So, rather than do a selective risk analysis where you may, and it certainly wouldn't make economic sense for you to try to do a detailed analysis of everything."
Remember we talked about priority.
"However, by using this combination of detailed for high risk areas and base line for everything else, you were able to touch a pretty wide swath of the organization and do it in a efficient and economical way."
"So that's, that's the benefit of the combination approach."
"And then, the last approach is the informal approach which is sort of the, you know, using your gut, using your heuristics, you know, things that you"
"learned, you know, rules of thumb and its not structured at all."
I would argue against doing the informal approach unless its the only approach you can do.
"And in some organizations, it may be the only approach you can do."
"Like I said, any, any approach is better than no approach."
"But, keep in mind that it's going to be very difficult for you to document that for you to make it repeatable. and if, if, you know, something you'll have to, live with."
"So, you know, think, think in terms of what's going to happen down the road as you make choices with respect to what's the right risk analysis approach for you and your organization."
This is that exhibit I was referring to.
"Basically, what you do with the a, with they baseline approach is you would set a baseline."
"We say, this is where we want our level of protection to be."
"And then, you would look at various assets and say, well, where are we vis-a-vis that level with respect to asset A. We've got a gap."
"And that's why you guys have all heard the term gap analysis, this is also called a gap analysis."
"You know, with asset B, you know, there's still a gap, and it's smaller."
"With asset C, there's no gap."
"In fact, we're higher than the level of protection we specified."
What does that mean?
"In less than a decade, forced evictions have become a reality to over a quarter million Cambodians."
Communities at risk are now documenting injustice and resistance with video.
"By raising their voices above the bulldozers, video is forcing dialogue and accountability."
"In the wake of the Cambodian civil war, Dr. Pong (...) Kek (??) created the organization LlCADHO to promote human rights and monitor violations."
"Since partnering with WlTNESS in 2007, LlCADHO has been working with video to create change for communities at risk of being illegally forced from their homes."
"We have to show to, first of all, our government, to the Cambodian public and to the international community... what is really happening in Cambodia."
And the evidence is taken by the video-camera so this is evidence that nobody can deny.
LlCADHO and WlTNESS are amplifying voices working to provide justice to the families affected country-wide
Right now there are 50 cameras in 18 provinces in the hands of community organizers trained by LlCADHO and WlTNESS.
One of those is the Venerable Luon Sovath... a monk whose village was forcefully evicted in 2009.
He has been documenting the on-going violence and rallying communities to stand up for their rights.
We are trying to teach and train the community to persevere using non-violence to gain justice... in order to claim our land back.
"Video is the source of information, and information is a community's power."
After people see the inustice through picture and video... we believe things will change.
Since exposing the truth of what happened to his village Venerable Sovath continues to produce videos... regardless of on-going threats from the government of being disrobed and imprisoned.
"Now known as the ""multimedia monk,"" the Venerable advocates for non-violent forms of resistance."
LlCADHO's work has resulted in documentation of the forcibly evicted that would otherwise have gone untold.
"Demanding action from audiences in Cambodia and worldwide, these are powerful tools for justice."
Let's go through an example.
In the last lessons you may have noticed our examples have been centered around social science.
"Like social networking, with the cloud example and your engagement in class."
But in this lesson and the next we'll be using a lot of examples from the fields of biology and medicine.
Since statistics is heavily used in those fields as well.
"I drew a finch here, and that's because this next example deals with the beak width of finches."
"Specifically, scientist have looked at finches to make hypotheses about evolution."
"By mapping a trait over time, like beak width."
We can tell if the environment is selecting for a particular size of beak width.
Maybe there's a particular beak size that better help this finch survive.
But sometimes there are random fluctuation in beak width due to variation in the population.
Some finches just have bigger beak widths than others.
Therefore to determine whether there is a significant change in beak width within the population over time.
We need to use statistics.
"The important message is that at the scale of life on the planet, global warming is trivial."
Life has dealt with it and will deal with it just fine.
"There will be extinctions, but life will not go extinct because of global warming."
"There's been plenty of species that could deal with much warmer conditions on the planet, and those kinds of things will increase in abundance as things warm."
However that doesn't mean that global warming is not important.
"Global warming is especially important because of sea level rise, and because of the increase in variation in weather patterns, which means that both periods of drought and floods will become more frequent at intermediate latitudes, and the intensity and the number of major storms will probably increase."
It would be interesting to know what the hurricane strength was
like back in the Silurian.
You know?
"Katrina might have been just a little blip, compared to a"
"Silurian hurricane, but unfortunately we don't know how big they were."
Now the fate of the carbon that was in the original planetary atmosphere can be sketched here.
"And basically what you see is that it's mostly in limestone and in sediment, and there's a huge chunk of it sitting in the ocean as bicarbonate."
So think about that the next time you buy a bottle of soda water or sparkling water.
"That's representative of 37 or 38,000 gigatons of carbon."
"Fossil fuel, organic sediment and so forth, you find that there's dissolved CO_2, which actually is the molecule CO_2, and not as the bicarbonate ion, in the ocean."
"Living biomass, fairly small; methane in the atmosphere pretty small."
"So when you look at that, you wonder well where is the biggest source of carbon that might get mobilized into the atmosphere?"
And in fact it's in methane hydrate.
Okay?
Methane hydrate will be a solid in cold water but it will melt and release methane with just a little increase in temperature.
Okay?
"It turns out there's about 100 trillion cubic meters of methane hydrate stockpiled around the planet, sitting there in sediments, ready to be mobilized."
"So if the world's oceans warm up by a few degrees, there will be a very dramatic positive feedback effect as this methane comes bubbling out."
"And methane is a more efficient greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, by quite a bit."
"So its contribution to global warming could triple and really accelerate, if things warm up."
And this is just a picture showing you that methane hydrate is stored in places like the sediments underneath deep water.
"So you have, say in the Arctic, it will be fairly shallow; off Louisiana it will be fairly deep."
But there's a lot of it.
The phosphorous cycle is different from the carbon and nitrogen cycles because phosphorous doesn't have a gaseous phase.
It's a solid or a liquid.
And it's the scarcest essential element.
"So that, you know, what's going to happen to that"
PVC pipe that exists in your house when your building gets torn down?
What's going to happen to the copper piping that delivers the water?
"Well, the PVC pipe, you can almost be assured is going to be either burned or it's going to be discarded in a"
landfill.
But the copper piping is highly likely to be recycled because of its market value.
So differences in these programs are normally associated with the way that they allocate credits or points to buildings for different purposes.
"But they really are quite similar in their attempt to promote energy conservation, concern for chemical life cycles, as well as human health."
"So the Green Building Council evolved, beginning in 1993."
And this is what I want to focus on now for the remainder of the session.
"And it is a voluntary nonprofit organization that has no government affiliation, although it was started by a grant from the U.S."
Energy Department.
"So this is created with a board of directors that include people that have expertise in architecture and engineering as well as some of the largest development firms, construction firms, in the nation."
There are really not a number of people on this board or on the staff that have deep environmental or health expertise.
And its orientation has predominantly been to promote energy efficiency.
"They claim that the benefits of this leadership in energy and environmental design, which is what the LEED acronym stands for, that it has three predominant purposes."
One is to promote environmental quality.
The second is economic development to basically stimulate a new type of building and new building materials that are more environmentally responsible.
Sorry about the noise.
And also to promote healthy lifestyles within buildings and communities.
"And by healthy lifestyles within a building,"
I'll give you one example.
"A colleague of mine works at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and they have a relatively new building."
"And just as a healthy lifestyle attribute, they decided that instead of putting a staircase in the back of the building and the elevator right near the front door when people walked in, that they would reverse that."
"So the elevator was put in the back and the staircase was surrounded by glass panels that made it really light, sunlight steams through and attractive."
"So that people, when they go into the building, normally walk up the stairs, a seven- or eight- story building."
So that this individual who directed the National Center for
"Environmental Health told me that he and his staff, that nobody uses the elevator, everybody goes up and down the stairs."
"So it saves energy, the elevator is not used much."
"And it also is healthy, it's burning up calories."
So that the purpose of LEED falls into a variety of categories.
"One is sustainable sites, another is water efficiency, another is energy and atmosphere, another is materials and resources."
And that's what we're trying to do.
"You can see here one of my colleagues, fighting off school children as they attempt to classify in an attempt to discover their own planet."
And so the message I want to leave you with is that there is a solution to this problem of big data.
There is a solution to this problem of having more data about the universe than we can possibly use.
"The solution is to invite hundreds of thousands, millions of people to come along, and join us in our scientific adventures."
"And if we can find a way to do that so that they feel they're making a real contribution, we not only educate these volunteers, but we can change their lives, and change their attitudes towards science as well."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
*Moaning and growling*
Library zombies again?
This is getting to be an everyday occurance.
These zombies are going to keep us from the instruction class.
It starts in 10 minutes!
And that zombie wants to eat up all our research.
What can we do?
Maybe....
That's it!
Here's an online course that deals with our research topic!
So we can learn how to use the library without having to run by the hungry undead!
"The library provides several hour-long virtual instruction sessions each semester, so that you can learn how to start your research assignments, and use citation management software without ever leaving home."
"The research classes provide a tour of the library's website, a description of our physical spaces, and help on finding resources that your professors will love, while the Zotero and Endnote classes will teach you basics, tips, and tricks for those programs."
"In this video I'll talk about various aspects of the course, the topics that we'll cover, the kinds of skills you can expect to acquire, the kind of background that I expect, the supporting materials and the available tools for self assessment."
Let's start with the specific topics that this course is going to cover.
The course material corresponds to the first half of the ten week Stanford course.
"It's taken by all computer science undergraduates, as well as many of our graduate students."
"There will be five high level topics, and at times these will overlap."
"The five topics are first of all, the vocabulary for reasoning about algorithm performance, the design and conquer algorithm design paradigm, randomization and algorithm design, primitives for reasoning about graphs, and the use and implementation of basic data structures."
The goal is to provide an introduction to and basic literacy in each of these topics.
"Much, much more could be said about each of them, than we'll have time for here."
"The first topic is the shortest, and probably also the driest."
But it's a prerequisite for thinking seriously about the design and analysis of algorithms.
"The key concept here is big-O notation, which, conceptually, is a modeling choice about the granularity with which we measure a performance metric like the running time of an algorithm."
The wage over the marginal product of labor.
So marginal cost is the wage over the marginal product of labor.
"Marginal product of labor was delta q delta I, so wage over the marginal product of labor is the marginal cost."
So think about this intuitively.
"What we're saying is the cost of the next unit of production is declining with the marginal product of labor, it sort of makes sense."
"The more productive is a worker, the less expensive is producing the next unit."
"The less productive is the next worker, the more expensive is producing the next unit."
So it's an inverse relationship between the marginal cost and the marginal product where the wage is the constant that scales that relationship.
"So basically, when workers are very, very high marginal product, then it's going to be cheap to produce the next unit."
"When workers have a low marginal product, it's going to be expensive to produce the next unit, and that's going to depend on what you actually have to pay the worker."
Questions about that?
"So basically, the first key thing we want to derive here is that the marginal cost is directly related to the marginal product of labor, and the marginal product of labor we saw last time comes out of production function."
"So if you're given a wage, and given a production function, you should be able to derive the short-run marginal cost."
You might someday be asked to do that.
Now what about the long-run?
"The short-run's no fun, what about the long-run?"
"In the long-run, firms can choose their mix of labor and capital."
"Remember, in the short-run the capital is fixed, so fixed costs rk bar."
The only thing they could change was the amount of
"labor, so we could derive their marginal costs."
What about in the long-run?
"Well, the long-run's a little more interesting because in the long-run firms get to choose their input mix to maximize their production efficiency."
So input mix is chosen to maximize production efficiency which equates to minimizing costs.
Maximizing production efficiency equates to minimizing costs.
"So we talked last time about isoquants, and the notion that isoquants were combinations of labor and capital that delivered the same output."
"Just like indifference curves are combinations of pizza and movies that deliver the same utility, isoquants are a combination of labor and capital that deliver the same output."
"The key point is that, technologically, any choice of"
"labor and capital produces the same q, so there's nothing that tells you technologically which of those to use."
"We just know, technologically, there's a set of choices which deliver the same q."
"Well, how do we tell which to use?"
"Well, we want to choose the one which is minimizing costs."
"So to do that, we're going to have to bring in the cost of those inputs."
And that's exactly what a topological ordering will accomplish.
"So, it's reasonable to ask the question, when does the directed graph have a topological ordering and when a graph does have such an ordering, how do we get our grubby little hands on it?"
"Well there's a very clear, necessary condition for a graph to have a topological ordering, which is, it had better be acyclic."
"Put differently, if a directed graph has a directed cycle then there's certainly no way there's going to be a topological ordering."
"So, I hope the reason for this is fairly clear."
Consider any directed graph which does have a directed cycle and consider any purported way of ordering the vertices.
Well now just traverse the edges of the cycle one by one.
So you start somewhere on the cycle.
"And if the first edge goes backwards, well you're already screwed."
You already know that this ordering is not topological; no way it just can go backwards.
"So evidently the first edge of this cycle has to go forward, but now you have to traverse the rest of the edges on this cycle, and eventually you come back to where you started."
"So if you started out by going forward, at some point you have to go backward."
"So that edge goes backward in the ordering, violating the property of the topological ordering."
"That's true for every ordering, so directed cycles exclude the possibility of topological orderings."
"Now the question is, well what if you don't have a cycle?"
Is that a strong enough condition that you're guaranteed to have a topological ordering.
"Is the only obstruction to sequencing jobs without conflicts, the obvious one of having circular precedence constraints?"
"So it turns out that only is the answer yes as long as you don't have any directed cycles, you're guaranteed a topological ordering, but we can even compute one in linear time no less, via depth-first search."
"So before I show you this super slick and super efficient reduction of computing topological orderings to depth first search, let me first go over a pretty good but slightly less slick and slightly"
less efficient solution to help build up your intuition about directed acyclic graphs and their topological orderings.
So for the straightforward solution we're going to begin with a simple observation.
Every directed acyclic graph has what I'm gonna call a sink vertex.
That is a vertex without any outgoing arcs.
"So in the four node, directed acyclic graph we were exploring on the last slide, there is exactly one source vertex and that's, excuse me, sink vertex, that's this right most vertex here."
Right?
That has no outgoing arcs; the other three vertices all have at least one outgoing arc.
"Now, why is it the case that a directed acyclic graph has to have a sink vertex?"
Well suppose it didn't.
Suppose it had no sink vertex.
That would mean every single vertex has at least one outgoing arc.
So what can we do if every vertex has one outgoing arc?
Well we can start in an arbitrary node.
"So why would a programmer, in their right mind, ever write a program that had code in it that wasn't going to be executed?"
"And there's several actually ways in which unreachable code can arise, and it's actually quite common."
"So this is an important optimization, getting rid of the unreachable code is actually fairly important."
"Perhaps the most common situation Is that the code is actually parameterized with, code that is only compiled and used in certain situations."
"So, for example, in C, It would be sorta typical to see some code that looks like this."
"If debug, then, you know, executes something, where debug is a pound defying constant."
"So in C, you can define names for literals."
So you say something like this.
You might define debug.
"To be zero, and so you might see a program that had this piece of code in it, and what this"
"literally means is that this piece of code is equivalent to if zero, then blah, blah, blah."
"Alright, so, so when you're compiling without debugging, you have debug to find the zero, when you're compiling with debugging, you would change this line to define debug to be some non zero constant."
So in this case we are compiling without debugging.
What will happen?
Well we'll see that this predicate is guaranteed to be zero the constant folding will take care of that.
And that will result in an unreachable basic block on the [inaudible] branch and then that code can be deleted And so essentially the compiler is able to go through using the optimizer and strip out all o f the debugging code.
That isn't going to be used since your compiler [inaudible].
Another case where unreachable code comes up is with libraries.
"So, very frequently, programs are written, to use generic"
libraries.
But the program might only use a very small part of the interface.
"So, the library might supply 100 methods, to cover all the situations that various programmers are interested in."
"But for your program, you might only be using three of those methods."
"And the rest of those methods could potentially be removed, from the final binary, to make the code smaller."
"And, finally another way that unreachable basic blocks occur, is as the results of other optimizations."
So as we will see optimizations frequently lead to other to more optimizations.
"And it could be that just through other rearrangements of the code that the compiler makes some basic block redundant and, and able to be deleted."
Now some optimizations are simpler to express if each register occurs only once on the
left-hand side of an assignment.
"So that means if each register is assigned, at most, once then some of these optimizations are easier to talk about."
"So we're gonna rewrite our intermediate code, always to so that it's in single assignment form."
So this is called single assignment form.
[Jorge Osma.
Lecturer of Master at the UJl.]
We monitor these variables in pregnant women on two occasions during the pregnancy and on three occasion after childbirth -up to three months after it-.
We think that a computer tool could be a useful and effective service to monitor and detect the risk of depression in woman during or after pregnancy.
-About a hundred women have already tried the application.
The first information makes possible to advance in the knowledge of which are the variables that have the greatest influence at the time of suffering from depression during pregnancy or postpartum.
"-The first information indicates that, when evaluating women before childbirth, 48 percent of these women might have had depressive symptoms before pregnancy."
This is a very important risk factor.
"Therefore, it justifies that it is necessary to monitor these women in order to control that depression does not appear during pregnancy or after birth."
20 percent of these women start to have depressive symptoms during pregnancy.
"Moreover, 20 percent women feel ambivalence during pregnancy."
"This means that sometimes they have feelings of pleasure because of the phase that they are passing through and feelings of desire of having a child, and sometimes quite the contrary: guilty feelings, feeling of not knowing to look after the child well, and feelings of worry and fear."
"-Some of the factors that may increase the risk of suffering from depression are the presence of psychopathologies in the mother or the family,"
"lack of social support, problems with the partner, increase of stress,"
low incomes or medical problems during pregnancy.
"In the second phase, the computer tool will also offer prevention and intervention treatments."
"The project goes for cybertherapy or online therapy, which is being consolidated as a complement and an alternative to the traditional psychological care."
'Mamá Feliz' deals with a disease suffered by a high percentage of mothers.
"-It is surprising that, although some studies suggest that 8 percent women in Spain get depressed after birth, there are no evaluation systems which detect it and make possible to act previously."
"Moreover, there are factors that indicate which women are more likely to get depressed, but nothing is done to evaluate and detect it."
-Women interested in participating in the study and knowing their emotional state during pregnancy and postpartum may do so through the webpage www.mamafeliz.es.

"In the media, there's a lot of that kond of stuff people don't know about numbers,"
"I'm a numbers guy, I'm a dweeb, all right?"
I apologise.
I'm a bit of a nerd about these kind of things
"I get really pissed off when people give out about, like crime going up, when say, the numbers are definitely going down."
"And then if you go ""The numbers are going down,"" they go,"
"""but the fear of crime is rising."""
"And you're going, ""but so what!?"" You know what I mean?"
This activity highlights only one facet within a vast framework of gender inequality.
The movement resisting this inequality is feminism.
Many people shy away from the term feminism.
"But in reality, the movement purely seeks social, political, and economic equality between men and women."
SPEAKER 35:
The best way to dismantle gender inequality is feminism.
The disparities that men and women experience will cease to exist only when we stop talking about gender equality and start taking action to make it a lived reality.
In children it is possible to see the entire nasal passage and the back of the nose or nasopharynx with routine endoscopic nasal examination.
"Here we looked at the left side of the nose and then through the right side we are going forward with a thin pediatric endoscope, meticulousy touching to the right inferior turbinate at the medial side."
And we begin to see the nasopahrynx at the back.
This thin endoscope does children no harm.
"So we can see the situation of the nasal mucosa, the signs of allergy or infections."
When we reach the nasopharynx as in this child we can see directly an adenoid tissue which is blocking the 3/4 of the posterior part of the nose.

"Hello happy viewers, and welcome to Golden Age Technology on Supreme Master Television."
"Today we present the conclusion of a two-part series introducing The Venus Project, a holistic, resource-based vision of the future, advocated by celebrated American inventor, designer and futurist, Jacque Fresco."
"Mr. Fresco was born in 1916 and grew up in New York city, USA."
He has a background in industrial design and previously worked as a consultant and researcher in the aviation industry.
"He has authored numerous books including ""Designing the Future,"" produced and been featured in documentaries and traveled extensively, promoting his ideas in television and radio interviews and seminars throughout the world."
"The Venus Project is a comprehensive plan to create a world where humans, animals and nature coexist peacefully."
The goal is to resolve all of today's serious world issues such as climate change and hunger through a restructuring of global society.
"Mr. Fresco is confident that this enormous transformation would usher a new age of harmony, prosperity and cultural advancement."
Implementation of The Venus Project would move us away from the current monetary-based economic system to a resource-based economy where our planet's gifts are designated as the heritage of all people.
"Designers and engineers would build holistic, sustainable cities using advanced technology."
We have chapters all over the world of The Venus Project.
We encourage you to look at our website.
We have Venus Project design teams.
"We have over 1,600 people who have signed up so far."
We are going to be working on more detailed brueprints for our city designs.
"We have a Corcen project where in one of Jacque's old books he talks about the Corcen, the centralized computer which is a database and organizes technically everything on a global basis within a resource-based economy."
Under The Venus Project's plan how is energy generated for our cities?
Energy for the city of the future.
Determined physicists believe they are now on the brink... of uncovering the ultimate mysteries of the universe.
Why look for these parallel universes that we can't touch?
Because they hold the secret of secrets.
They hold the secret of the origin of everything there is.
"For the first time, we can imagine where our universe itself came from."
Perhaps when our universe popped into existence... colliding with another parallel universe... perhaps budding from another universe... these are the stuff of modern research today: pre-Big Bang physics.
Physics before Genesis.
But there is a problem.
"For decades, scientists have been searching... for one cohesive theory of everything... one to unite Einstein's theory of general relativity... which explains how gravity works over large scales... with quantum physics, the science of the tiniest matter."
"Together, these two great theories explain... everything humanity knows so far about the cosmos."
But like a cartoon cat and mouse...
They are at war with one another.
These two theories hate each other.
"They're completely inconsistent, incompatible."
No way to understand in today's world... a quantum version of general relativity.
How can we get a shotgun marriage... between these two theories that don't like each other?
"Bringing those together would give you... a theory of everything in the sense... that those are the ingredients you would need, I think... to understand the Big Bang... to understand the origin of the universe."
"When, in the 1980s, scientists came up with... a lyrical-sounding idea, string theory... it promised to solve all the mysteries of the universe... including whether or not parallel universes are real."
The idea is that all particles are not solid points or dots... as science said they were.
"Instead, if you could see up close... particles are, in fact, tiny string-like objects... that individually vibrate in various ways."
"String theory starts out... by taking the idea of a string which vibrates... giving rise to different particles, and doing physics with that."
"That's rather musical, in a way."
It's like using guitar and bass in a band... to generate different notes from vibrations of strings.
As scientists explored string theory more closely... they made a remarkable discovery.
We found that it wasn't just strings... that were involved in the physics... but also membranes and other extended objects... which could vibrate.
And that's rather like enlarging the band... to have drums and other instruments... which enrich the sound... and really broaden the repertoire of things that could be played.
String theory has now evolved into what is called...
"""M"" or membrane theory."
"So now we realize that the particles we see in nature, the universe itself... consists of vibrating membranes and vibrating strings."
"The crowning achievement of M-theory came... when scientists realized that, to make sense of everything... you need to think of the universe as existing in 11 dimensions."
"If you're sitting on a mountaintop... and you look down, you can see all the separate little villages... that are not unified at all."
"But from a mountaintop, you look at a coherent, whole, beautiful picture."
"As I said I just couldn't be more impressed both in terms of what it's doing for my partner Isaac, but for how I'm getting some of my old high school math back."
Let's begin lesson six.
We're going to look at human factors this week.
A couple of things involving managing people in organizations and how to maintain information assurance.
We're also going to be talking about.
Good security awareness training programs and what they consists of.
"So, when you finish this lesson, you'll be able to describe how the human element factors in the information insurance planning."
"Additionally, you understand the role of security awareness in successful programs, and then you're going to be able to identify and describe the key principles that should drive security awareness programs, and we'll have a few other tidbits about people along the way."
"So, the people problem, and its impacts on IA planning."
"Well, we're the weakest link, for certain."
How do we control the people factor?
"Well, we can vet them, we can train them and we can monitor them."
"So, as far as vetting is concerned, what we're attempting to do is to keep out the bad apples."
"So,"
The federal governments in the United States does have a process by which they give security clearances to people.
"Especially when they're in sensitive positions, whether they're designated managers."
This affects their access and their clearance levels depending on the vetting process.
And the depth of the background check varies depending on the sensitivity of the person's position.
So here are the kinds of categories that might exist.
"Different government agencies have different names for these categories but we have non-sensitive, non-critical sensitive, critical sensitive, and special sensitive."
"Now industry, at large, doesn't have such a formal structure."
"However, they do have categories for information and for positions in organizations that are informally described."
"So you'll have things like company proprietary or company confidential, as opposed to public information."
"So some of the people controls that you can implement at an organization, is where do you place the Chief Information Security Officer?"
"Obviously if the ClSO is in the C-Suite, they're in a better position to influence information assurance planning and get the other executives aboard who support, are needed, to do a successful program."
"And, you can also look at hiring."
"You have sight security plans from the Federal government, that deal with hiring policies and background investigations, you might even find that in the industry as well."
"As far as managing people is concerned, one of the key ideas is separation of duties."
"So that, if you have a sensitive function, there is never just one person responsible, for example writing a check to vendor From beginning to end of the paperwork series, you'd want to have more than one person, to ensure that someone is not tempted to write the check and divert money into their own account."
There's access administration.
How do you control passwords and who has access physically to certain systems.
And there may be data destruction policies.
I know that records officers experiences in agencies with the level of access they're granted is highly variable.
So that may be something to discuss at your agency.
If that would be appropriate.
"And if it's determined that they should, that could be incorporated into the policy."
"So that doesn't answer the question, but I don't know that I can make that assessment."
"If that doesn't answer your question, go ahead and ask a followup on that and I can try again."
So the last one on here is to document the lessons learned from the pilot.
From this experience you can identify ways to improve for your next steps in conducting the project.
A successful organization and maintenance of shared drives is going to involve many stakeholders.
Senior management are key to serve as champions for the project.
"Records management staff ensure that the policies and procedures are maintained, and then followed."
"Information technology staff manage the network operations, information security, and help desk services."
"The subject matter experts, those end users that actually create and use content, can provide information about what's there and can tell you what's actually on the shared drive."
Staff responsible for litigation holds and pending information requests.
For FOlA or Privacy Act.
They can be helpful to prevent the deletion of any responsive content.
Organization of the shared drive involves analysis of the current state.
The current shared drive structure and any practices.
"This involves reviewing any IT requirements, IT platforms, enterprise architecture, security requirements."
All of these help to understand the impacts on the project or that the project may have on the systems.
To collect data regarding the current status.
"This could be the number of shared drives within an organization, the volume of content on each of those shared drives, the current directory structures, the file types and formats that exist, and file dates such as when the file was created or last modified."
"And then it's also helpful to evaluate any pending IT plans that could impact the project, such as a planned migration to a new shared drive or a consolidation."
Or any other technology issues or refreshes that might be happening or planned for the near future.
And then identifying and reviewing any controls that are currently in place.
"Such as certain offices may have their own naming conventions, version management, file plans, or ways they apply metadata to files."
And then the last one on here is to interview SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) and any other stakeholders to understand how they're using shared drives.
"So in identifying and removing unwanted content, think about using rules and queries to identify unwanted content."
"Some of this could include system-generated backup files, temp files, old applications, old install files, multiple copies of files that contain identical content in different formats."
In our experience we found that we often had a word document and the associated PDF.
"And they were the same document, but there were multiple copies in different places."
"This could include digital photos and videos that could be stored in another, more appropriate location."
Awkward.
"I am so tried of hearing this bullsh*t, Venus and Mars,"
"Men and women are just wired differently, ""logic"","
"The reason that there are fewer female comedians in the popular imagination than there are male ones, is because the comedy scene is really misogynistic."
Most popular male comedians taking cheap shots at women all the frigging time in their sets.
"Sure, we're talked a lot about in comedy, like we're the long and suffering house-wives, or we're the sluts,"
"Or we're the victims of rape jokes, or we are the , you know, ohh, women are just so crazy, like, I'll never understand their silly little brains,"
"And our experiences, no matter how varied and vast, are always marginalised into this really horrible little category, of niche, or women's comedy,"
"The moment that you don't make a fart joke, which, coincidently, a lot of women are kind of shamed out of at a very young age,"
"And instead want to talk about what you're going to do with your old wedding dress, post divorce,"
Is the moment that you're going to be quite ruthlessly heckled by the audience.
"The patriarchy is rigged so that we would believe that the universal experiences, white, able-bodied, cis, straight, middle-aged, are unquestionably logical."
Man:
"And don't try trying to prove us wrong ladies,"
"And of course, male."
"And you only have to look at the panel of many comedy shows on the telly,"
"Like, 'Mock the Week', or 'Ql', just to see this demographic reflected back onto us,"
"Hours and hours of prime-time telly, just dedicated to lines of white, middle-class men, just telling us about, well, their own experiences of the world,"
It's a social status thing.
"People with the most power will promote the comedy that most reflects their own, personal experience,"
"And ignore the things that they don't identify with,"
"And so any comedy that deviates from that very narrow experience of life is going to be put in a kind of, neatly labelled box,"
With it's appropriate viewing hours and it's sanctions.
"And so women comedians are entering an arena where if the talk about their own personal experiences that don't match up with this kind of,"
"Hierarchical, masculine, view of the world, then they're going to be dismissed as 'women's' comedy, and will be used in a degrading way,"
"And it's really cisexist to boot, because often, you know, men dismiss female comedians saying like,"
"""Oh, well, you know, it's all just period jokes and diets."
"Ergh!"""
"And ultimately if a woman f*cks up her comedy on the stage, then her entire gender is smeared."
"You're not just a woman who isn't funny, believe me, there are plenty of us, like, just ask me what my favourite joke is sometime, it's pretty dire,"
"And no, you serve us this, lazy, short-hand kind of 'proof', that all women aren't funny,"
"And this is only something that can be changed through socialisation, by encouraging children of all genders,"
"Yonkers, New York"
Yonkers is the 4th largest city in the American state of New York. It is the southwestern part of Westchester County
"Yonkers borders the New York City borough of The Bronx and is 2 miles (3 km) north of Manhattan. Broadway runs through all three, and railroads also connect them to Grand Central Terminal. The Bronx River separates Yonkers from Mount Vernon, New York on the east. The Hudson River is on the west. The city's best-known attraction is Yonkers Raceway, a harness racing track. There is a large shopping area along Central Park Avenue. It is sometimes called ""Central Avenue"" by area residents."
Louisa Adams
"Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams (February 12, 1775 – May 15, 1852) was the wife of the 6th President of the United States, John Quincy Adams. As the wife of the president of the United States, she was the First Lady of the United States from 1825 to 1829."
"She was born in London. Her mother, Catherine Nuth Johnson was an English lady. Her father, Joshua Johnson, was from the US and a citizen of the USA. Louisa Adams was then the only First Lady not born in the United States. John Adams, the second president of the US, was her father-in-law."
"In 1794, John Quincy Adams met Louisa in London. At that time, Adams was a US diplomat. After about three years, they married. The couple also lived in Berlin where Adams got a posting. Louisa along with her husband arrived to the US in 1801. They lived in different places before her husband became the President.She went to school in London and France."
"She died in 1852, aged 77. She is buried in the United States Parish Church, Quincy, Massachusetts."
Angelica Van Buren
"Angelica Singleton Van Buren (February 13, 1818 - December 29, 1877) acted as the First Lady of the United States. She was the daughter-in-law of Martin Van Buren, the 8th president of the USA. Angelica Singleton had married the President's son, Abraham Van Buren. She took over the role of the First Lady, as the president's wife had died 17 years earlier."
"Angelica Singleton belonged to a high society. She was also related to Dolley Madison, wife of US President James Madison. Angelica brought a special style to her role as the First Lady."
"She and Abraham Van Buren married in 1838. After marriage they took a long tour of Europe. When they came back to the US in 1839, she took up the role of the First Lady during the presidency of her father-in-law. In 1841, Martin Van Buren was defeated, she and her husband shifted to Kinderhook, Lindenwald. During the winter, they lived in their family home in South Carolina. From 1848 until her death in 1877, she lived in New York City."
"Angelica was from the cream of southern society and was the great-granddaughter of Gen. Richard Richardson and Mary Cantey (Richardson). Gen. Richardson was the progenitor of six South Carolina governors, three Manning and three Richardson governors. One descendant, Elizabeth Peyre Richardson, was so closely related to all of these governors that she appears in Ripley's Believe it or Not. Angelica's sister, Marion, has a bio that, although sad, is actually more interesting than hers. See ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" by Joseph C. Elliott, Sandlapper: The Magazine of South Carolina."
Jane Irwin Harrison
"Jane Irwin Harrison (July 23, 1804 – May 11, 1846) was the First Lady of the United States for a very brief period. She was married to William Henry Harrison Jr. William was the son of William Henry Harrison, ninth President of the United States. As the daughter-in-law of the president, she acted as the First Lady for about a month in 1841. She acted as his official hostess during his brief tenure in office, which lasted for a month in 1841. President’s wife Anna Harrison was very ill, and she could not go out of their home in Ohio, when her husband moved to take up the presidency."

Gameplay.
"Two players competed. At the start, a computer image of the ""Scrabble"" board was shown. A letter would be given in the center space. The host told the players the number of letters in the word, and then read a clue to the word. The player would take two numbered tiles. These tiles were placed in a slot, giving the player two letters. The player would then choose a letter to place in the word. If the letter was in the word, it was placed into the word. The player then made a guess to the word or placed the other tile. If the player could not guess the word after placing the tile, they took two more tiles. Play continued until the player guessed the word (done by the player hitting their buzzer) or there was only one letter left in the word. If a correct guess was made, the player won the word. If an incorrect guess was made, play passed to the other player. Three words won the game. Two games were played with two different players."
"Three of the letters were ""Stoppers,"" a letter that was not in the word. If one of those letters were chosen, the player lost their turn."
"Some of the letters were placed into blue and pink squares. If the player guessed the word after placing a letter into one of these squares, they won a bonus. A blue square was worth $500, while a pink square was worth $1,000 to Count Money"
"If all three stoppers were chosen, there was a 2-2 tie, or time was running short, Speedword was played. In Speedword, each letter in the word was revealed one at a time. The first player to buzz in with a correct guess won the word. 3 Stoopers 1 or 2"
Scrabble Sprint.
"The two winning players of the main game played in the Scrabble Sprint. Here, the winners of the two games competed to guess four words in the fastest time. The four words were six, seven, eight, and nine letters long. The winner of the first game played first. For each word, the player was told the number of letters in the word, and then was given a clue. When the host said to start, the clock started counting up. The player was given two letters, and selected one to place in the word. When the player wanted to guess the word, they hit a buzzer and made their guess. If correct, they moved on to the next word. If incorrect, ten seconds was added to their time, and they had to play another word of the same length. Once the player guessed all four words, the clock stopped. This set the time for the second player to beat."

Inverted roller coaster
"Inverted Coaster (""sometimes known as Inverts by Coaster enthusiasts"") is a roller coaster designed by Bolliger and Mabillard and was first conceived in 1992. Unlike the other coaster which above the track, This coaster sits you by the bottom of the track. making a flying sensation."
Development.
"The inverted coaster was coined by the Swiss roller coaster designers Bolliger &amp; Mabillard (B&amp;M) In 1991/92. The first installation of the Inverts came at Six Flags Great America in 1992. Batman: The Ride opened to much fanfare and was ""cloned"" many times at other parks. The inverted coaster quickly became an favorite with custom designs installed nearly every year. The tallest and fastest inverted coaster is Wicked Twister at Cedar Point at 215 feet (66 m) tall and reaching speeds up to 72 miles per hour. Although, it was not built by B&amp;M. The longest inverted coaster is Banshee at Kings Island which travels along 4,124 feet of track."
"In the 11th century, Richard II of Normandy chose an Italian architect called William de Volpiano to build the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. Volpiano had already built the Abbey of Fécamp, in Normandy. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey. He chose to place the transept crossing at the top of the mount. He also built a lot of crypts and chapels below the ground. These are to support building above, because it is very heavy. Today, Mont-Saint-Michel has a church of Romanesque style."
"Robert de Thorigny was a great supporter of Henry II of England. Henry was also Duke of Normandy at this time. Thorigny made the structure of the buildings stronger. He also built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, the Breton ""Guy de Thouars"", a friend of the King of France, attacked the mount with an army. He set fire to the village and killed lots of people. However, he had to retreat (leave) under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire extended to the buildings, and the roofs burnt. Philip Augustus, Thorigny's friend, was unhappy about the cruel actions and the destruction. He offered Abbot Jourdain some money to build a new Gothic-style architectural set. The abbot added the refectory (""dining room"") and cloister."
"Charles VI added big fortifications to the abbey-mount. He also added building towers and courtyards, and he made the ramparts stronger."
Administration.
"The islet is part of the French commune of Mont-Saint-Michel. It is in the department of Manche, in Normandy. As of 2009, 44 people live there. The nearest large town, with a train station, is Pontorson. Mont-Saint-Michel is part of the Organization of World Heritage Cities."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is also the subject of a traditional rivalry between Normans and Bretons. Bretons say that the Couesnon River marks the limit between Normandy and Brittany. It is only because the river has changed its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side. This legend amuses the area's inhabitants. They state that the border is not located on the Couesnon river. They say it is on the mainland, to the west, at the foot of the solid mass of Saint-Brelade."
Population.
"Up to 20,000 people a day visit the city in July and August. Among the 43 inhabitants (2006), 5 were monks and 7 nuns."
Twin towns – Sister cities.
"Mont-Saint-Michel has historical links with St Michael's Mount in Cornwall, UK. Edward the Confessor gave it to the Benedictines of Mont-Saint-Michel in the 11th century."
Historical monument.
61 buildings of Mont-Saint-Michel are on the list of historical monuments. They were added from 1928 to today.
Spring 1945 offensive in Italy
The Spring 1945 offensive in Italy was given the code name Operation Grapeshot. It was the Allied attack by Fifth United States Army and British 8th Army into the Lombardy Plain. It started on 6 April 1945 and ended on 2 May with the surrender of German forces in Italy.
Background.
The Allies had done their previous major attack on the Gothic Line in August 1944. The British 8th Army attacked up the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The U.S. 5th Army attacked through the central Apennine Mountains.
They managed to break through the Gothic Line defences. But they failed to get into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather stopped them.
They had a hard time in the cold winter weather. They planned to attack again in the spring.
Command changes.
Harold Alexander was promoted to Field Marshal. He was made the Allied Supreme Commander Mediterranean on 12 December.
"On 23 March, Albert Kesselring was appointed Commander-in-Chief Army Group West."
Orders of battle.
"In the spring, the problems of getting troops continued. The 15th Army Group had 1,334,000 men with Eighth Army having 632,980 men and Fifth Army 266,883. Against them were 21 much weaker German divisions and 4 Italian divisions, a total of 25."
Plan of attack.
"Clark made his plan on 18 March. He wanted destroy the maximum number of enemy forces, cross the Po and capture Verona."
"The Eighth Army was to go north west to capture Ferrara and Bondeno. The U.S. Fifth Army was to go past Bologna to surround German forces south of the Po. The Fifth Army was to go west towards Ostiglia. Next, the Allies would capture bridge across the Po and go north."
"The Fifth Army plan (Operation ""Craftsman"") aimed to pull German reserves away from Route 65. II Corps would then attack."
Battle.
"In the first week of April, attacks were launched on the right and left of the Allied lines. The goal was to draw German reserves away from the main attacks to come. Axis forces had to use sea, canal and river routes for supply. Axis shipping was being attacked in bombing raids."
"The main attack started on 6 April with an artillery bombing of the Senio defenses. On 9 April, 825 heavy bombers dropped bombs near the Senio. From 15:20 to 19:10, artillery was fired. As well, 28 Churchill Crocodiles and 127 Wasp flamethrower vehicles were sent out. By 12 April, the 8th Indian Division was on the far side of the Santerno. The British 78th Division moved to attack Argenta."
"The U.S. 5th Army began its attack on 14 April. First, there was a bombing by 2,000 heavy bombers and 2,000 artillery pieces. Then troops attacked. By 20 April both corps had broken through the German defences and reached the Po valley. 10th Mountain Division went north. By 19 April, the British 6th Armoured Division was moving to surround the German armies defending Bologna. Bondeno was captured on 23 April. Bologna was entered on 21 April.

Partisans had captured the German garrison of 5,000."
Three Kingdoms.
"Between 57 BC and the year 668 there were three kingdoms in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. The names of the kingdoms were: Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje. In the year 372, the religion Buddhism came from China to Korea. Buddhism was very important in Korea."
"In the year 660, the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Baekje. In the year 668 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Goguryeo. The people of Goguryeo ran away and made a new kingdom with the name Balhae. After a little time, the kingdom of Balhae was invaded by Liao Dynasty."
"When Silla was the only country, it had the name Unified Silla. In the Silla kingdom Buddhism was very important."
The northern and southern kingdoms.
"In the year 698, Balhae was founded by allies of Goguryeo. We call the time when united Silla and Balhae were existing together (698∼926) ""The northern and southern kingdoms period""."
Goryeo.
In the year 918 the kingdom of Goryeo began. The name Korea comes from Goryeo. The kingdom of Goryeo had power until the year 1392.
"The kingdom of Goryeo wrote the law in books, and had a big government. Buddhism was very important in the kingdom of Goryeo. Bronze-type printing technology was invented in Goryeo Dynasty. This is known as the world's oldest bronze-type printing technology."
"The Mongol empire conquered Goryeo and forced Korea to pay a tribute in Korean girls and eunuchs to the Mongol court with about 500,000 Korean girls and eunuchs taken to Yuan China. Mongol and Central Asian Semu Hui Tammachi army officials in Korea itself also took Korean women as concubines and Korea officials complained about it, begging the Mongol court to withdraw them from Korea. Koreans wrote erotic songs about how Korean women were seduced by Central Asian Muslims in their bakeries."
"An amusing incident is reported as having occurred about this time. A courtier named Pa-gyu observed to the king, “The male population of the country has been decimated but there are still plenty of women. For this reason it is that the Mongols take so many of them. There is danger that the pure Koryŭ stock will become vitiated by the intermixture of wild blood. The king should let each man take several wives and should remove the restrictions under which the sons of concubines labor."" When the news of this came to the ears of the women they were up in arms, as least the married portion ; and each one read to her spouse such a lecture that the subject was soon dropped as being too warm to handle. When the king passed through the streets with Pa-gyu in his retinue the women would point to the latter and say “There goes the man who would make concubines of us all."""
Joseon.
"In the year 1392 a man from the military of Korea went to China. His name was Yi Seonggye. His job was to attack Yuan China. But he returned without doing it. When he came back to Korea, he changed the kingdom. He became king."
"The name of the kingdom was Joseon. In the year 1394, the people of Joseon moved the capital to Seoul. The religion of Buddhism was not important. A new religion, Confucianism was important. Confucianism came from China."
In the year 1443 King Sejong ruled Joseon. He invented the Korean alphabet Hangeul.
"In the year 1592 and the year 1598 the people from Japan fought Korea. A man from the military made very strong ships, including the famous turtle ship. The name of the man was Yi Sun-sin. With the strong ships, the people of Korea won."
The people of Joseon were friends with the people of China.
"Today, North Koreans use the name Joseon (officially Chosŏn) to mean Korea."
19th century.
In the 19th century the people of Korea did not want to trade with other people. People called Korea Hermit Kingdom.
"The people of the United States and Japan wanted to trade with Korea. Before 1876, people failed when they tried to use force to trade with Korea. In the year 1876 the military of Japan fought Korea. Korea and Japan made a contract to trade."
"In 1895 Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War in the Korean peninsula. This ended Chinese influence in Korea. Empress Myeongseong, also called Queen Min, wanted the Russian Empire as a friend, to help Korea against Japan. Agents of the Ambassador of Japan killed her in October 1895."
"In 1905 Japan won the Russo-Japanese War. In the year 1910, the emperor of Japan made Korea a colony of Japan."
Colony of Japan to today.
Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 to 1945.
"When World War II started, the policy of the Japanese government changed. The government made the religion of Japan (Shinto) the religion of Korea."
In 1945 Japan lost World War II. The United States and Soviet Union made a contract. United States occupied the south of Korea and Soviet Union occupied the north of Korea.
The people of Korea wanted to be independent. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed the people of Korea would be free and independent. But soon the United States and Soviet Union were not friends and the Cold War started. United States and Soviet Union refused to settle a deal. In 1948 the people in the south made an independent country called South Korea (also called the Republic of Korea). The United States helped them. In 1948 the people in the north also made a country North Korea (also called the DPRK or Democratic People's Republic of Korea). The Soviet Union helped North Korea.
"In 1950 a war started in Korea. The name of the war was the Korean War. The war ended in 1953, but no peace treaty was signed. The border line between North and South was almost the same in the end as it was before the war."

Floppy disk
"The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored."
Floppy disks store much less data than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents.
"A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 MB of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega."
"Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock."
The floppy drive.
"A floppy drive (often called drives “A” and “B” on a computer running DOS or Windows) can be connected to or installed in a personal computer (PC). It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ""floppy disk"", is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the files saved on the disk."
Nat King Cole
"Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music."
Early years.
"When Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years."
His interest in jazz.
"Cole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano."
Well-known popular singer.
"By the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records."
"The first song he recorded for Capitol was “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies."
"Nat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include “Sweet Lorraine,” “Nature Boy,” “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,” “When I Fall in Love,” and “Mona Lisa.” In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of “Mona Lisa.” That song made him famous as a singer."
"Nat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is ""Saint Louis Blues"". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called ""The Nat King Cole Story""."
"In the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time."
He received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
His success as a black man.
"By 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada."
Cole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.
"Cole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems."
"Cole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support ""The Nat King Cole Show"" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year."
His family.
"Nat King Cole was married two times. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children."
"When his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered parts of his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's arm enshrined in his royal centre at Bamburgh and his head was taken to Lindisfarne."
"Oswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia."
Easter controversy.
"When Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church."
"To resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colmán argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English."
"Bede, in his ""Ecclesiastical History"", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died ."
Family.
"Based on Nennius' ""Historia Brittonum"" Oswiu's first wife was a Briton named Reinmelth. She was the daughter of Royth, King of Rheged. Together they had a son:"
&lt;br&gt;
"By Fina, daughter of the Irish High King Coleman, he had:"
&lt;br&gt;
"Oswiu married Eanflaed, daughter of King Edwin of Deira. Together they had:"

Indian music
"There are lots of different varieties of Indian music. Most of the different types of music are similar to Western music types. Pop, classical, and folk are all included. India’s classical music has a history originating hundreds of years back and is still popular in India today, as religious inspiration or pure entertainment. Like Africa, India has many different ethnic groups, speaking their own languages, and having very distinct cultural traditions."
"The tal, or tala, is a repeating rhythm pattern usually played by the tabla. It usually has between six and sixteen beats. The beats are grouped into small sections in the pattern. The first note in the pattern is called a ‘sam’. It shows the beginnings and ends of improvisation, so it is often emphasized."
"The Raga is also a pattern, but it differs from Western scales or melodies. Ragas are sort of a mix of scales and melodies. They have particular ascending and descending patterns. Ragas are used to symbolize the time of day, season, mood or special occasion."
"A drone is a note that’s either held or repeated throughout a piece of music. It’s usually the tonic note, the starting note. Nowadays, the drone is played by an electrical box, but traditionally, it is played using the tanpura, which is also known as the Tambura."
"Improvisation is when the player does not have a prepared piece or an incomplete piece of music, and they make up notes as they play. Improvisation is recognized as a form of composition."
"There are 4 types of structure in Indian Music, Alap, Jhor, Jhala and Gat/Bandish. Each of these has different roles in a piece of Indian music."
Alap is the name for the opening part of a piece of classical music from North India. It is a type of melodic improvisation that includes a Raga in it. Only the singer and the drone can be heard at this point.
Jhor is a more elaborate version of the Raga that is included in the Alap. It forms the beginning of the performance. This comes after Alap and before Jhala.
Jhala indicates the fast-paced ending of the Raga. It is often distinguished by the overcoming of the melodic component by the rhythm.
"The Gat, or Bandish is a permanent composition set in a specific Raga. It is accompanied by the Tabla, a drone and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonica."
"One story is one of Hemingway's best. The story, called ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", tells of Hemingway's fears about himself. It is about a writer who betrays his art for money and is unable to remain true to himself."
For Whom the Bell Tolls.
"In 1936, the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again. He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization."
"It was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that ""bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. """
"The trip to Spain resulted in two works: a play called ""The Fifth Column"", and a novel called ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side. During the fighting, he escapes his fear of death and of being alone. He decides that ""he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years."""
Later days and his married life.
"The book was a great success. Hemingway enjoyed being famous. His second marriage was ending. He divorced Pauline and married reporter Martha Gellhorn. He had met her while they were working in Spain. They decided to live in Cuba, near the city of Havana. Their house looked out over the Caribbean Sea."
But this marriage did not last long. Hemingway was changing. He began to feel that whatever he said was right. Martha went on long trips to be away from him. He drank heavily to forget his loneliness.
"When America entered World War Two, Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter. Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris."
"During the war, Hemingway met another reporter, Mary Walsh. In 1945, when his marriage to Martha was legally over, he married Mary."
"After the war, Hemingway began work on his last important book, ""The Old Man and the Sea"". It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature."
"Hemingway said, ""I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the reader's experience."""
"In 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature. But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony."
"Ernest Hemingway was 60 years old, but he said he felt like he was 86. Even worse, he felt that he no longer was able to write. He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money."
"In 1961, Ernest Hemingway shot himself dead. Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best:"
"""To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want."""
"Ernest Hemingway owned many cats, especially cats with extra toes. Today these cats are sometimes called ""Hemingway cats"" in his honor. His house in Key West, Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens."

Reed (instrument)
"A reed is a piece of dry bamboo that is used in some musical instruments such as saxophones, clarinets and oboes. The musician blows air through the mouthpiece where the reed is firmly placed, and the air makes the reed vibrate; this vibration in the mouthpiece produces sound all along the instrument, which is changed into specific musical notes depending on the physical nature of the instrument."
"Musical instruments that use reeds are members of the woodwind family, because many years ago the instruments were all made of wood. Today the instruments can be made of metal (brass, silver, gold), wood, or a hard plastic made to look like wood."
"The bassoon family of instruments and the oboe family of instruments play with a double reed. Players play through blowing air through the double reed, making the reeds vibrate. A mouthpiece is not needed."

Irai Leima
Irai Leima () or Ireima () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess and the divine female personification of water and aquatic life. She is also considered to be the incharge of the diseases.
"She is the consort of Irai Ningthou (literally, ""king of water""). Both are regarded as the divine spirits of water bodies."
Mythology.
"Irai Leima is the daughter of King Heibok Ningthou and the princess of Heibok Ching. Her father was an expert in witchcraft and black magic. Irai Leima is known for her exceptional beauty. One day, she was fishing in the Liwa river. King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw her and fell in love with her. He proposed her. She replied that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa consulted his subjects. They presented Heibok Ningthou many presents. King Kwakpa planned to marry Irai Leima if her father agreed or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the arrogance of Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the gifts into stone. At this, followers of Kwakpa fled the place. Kwakpa returned home disappointed."
"One day, King Kwakpa got intoxicated after drinking a juice of the roots of Tera plant (""Bambax malabaricum""). He wanted to meet Irai Leima. So, he went to her place riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore."
"Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess."
"The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast (""Chaklen Katpa"") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi."
Worship.
"When a person gets ill after bathing in a spring, pool, stream, people believed that the water spirits (Irai Leima and Irai Ningthou) had caught the person. To get well again, people worship the two deities. For this, the maibas perform the rites and rituals. The offerings include 2 eggs and 7 bamboo vessels filled up with rice paste."
"The also highly respect the deities. They offer many wild sacrifices. The sacrifices maybe a white fowl, a pig, a dog or a he-goat."
Identification with other deities.
"Irai Leima (""Ireima"") is considered as one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimaren), the supreme mother earth goddess. She is also described as a form of goddess Imoinu."
"Irai Leima is also known as Hiyangthang Lairembi. During the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias ""Pamheiba""), goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is observed as the ""Bor Numit"" (literally, Boon Day)."
Panthoibi
"Panthoibi () or Panthoipi () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of civilization, courage, fertility, handicraft, love, victory, warfare and wisdom. She is married to Nongpok Ningthou."

Panthoibi is frequently associated with Leimarel Sidabi. She is regarded as one of the representations of Leimarel.

Ice candle is a kind of candle made from water. It is fantastical and looks like a lamp-shade. It has been made in cold areas in winter. It melts in a few days so we can enjoy it for a moment.
History.
"The Ice candle was first made in Shimokawa, Hokkaido. In Shimokawa, there are few days in a year when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees below freezing. So this town is known as extreme cold. The members of “Egg of Columbus”, which is a Town Development Idea Semester in Shimokawa, had thought about some ideas on how people enjoy a cold winter with snow. In 1985, they found a sentence, “...the flame moves in the ice block, it changes to the natural lamp-shade quickly, the flame in the natural and pale clear glass lights up in the garden fantastically...” This is from “Live in north literary calendar, Northern area column (Kita no kurashi saiziki, Hoppo-ken column)” written by Ryuichi Ito who was a professor of Hokkaido university of education. He wrote about the candle which is made by Scandinavian Finland children. The Egg of Columbus got some hints to create the Ice candle from that sentence. In 1986, the Ice candle was created. They put a wish for people to be able to spend winter happily in it. In 1987, the Ice candle was introduced on TV. From around that time, townspeople have made it at their own home. Now, the Ice candle is known by Japanese nationwide and loved by people living in cold areas."
How to make.
"To make the Ice candle, you need a bucket, water and a cold environment to freeze water."
"At night the temperature is under -16 degrees, put water into the bucket, then get it outside and through the night. Next morning, turn it upside down and take out the ice if the water has almost frozen. Flow outside the water which couldn’t freeze. Put a candle into the hole of the ice. Not to break it, treat it carefully."
"We can make it with our own original ideas. For example, the colors and the shapes. If you want to color it, you can use a food coloring or paints. If you want to make it differently, you can use a milk carton or a balloon instead of a bucket."
Ice candle festival.
"The Ice Candle Festival is one of the festivals which is held in winter. In this festival, the venue is illuminated by many Ice candles. The place of origin is also Shimokawa in Hokkaido. Two years later after the Ice candle appeared, the name of Shimokawa Winter Festival, which was already there, was changed to Ice Candle Festival. In this festival, the Ice candle was put not only at the venue but also at each house in the town. In total, about 7000 Ice candles were put in the town. In addition, people who go to the festival enjoy eating food outside while seeing the Ice candles. Now, the Ice Candle Festival is held in various places in Japan.

Molière
"Molière (1622 – 17 February 1673) was a French actor, director and writer. His real name was Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, Molière was his stage name. He wrote some of the most important comedies in human history."
"He was born in Paris where his father owned a carpet shop. As a young person, Molière decided to live an artist's life. At the age of 21, he founded a theatre company that soon went bankrupt. From 1645 to 1658, he toured France with some of his friends."
"Later, King Louis XIV made Molière responsible for the entertainment at the court of Versailles near Paris. Molière was happy to have the king among his friends, because he had many enemies, especially important people in the Roman Catholic church. Molière's comedies deal with human weaknesses: jealousy, meanness, hypocrisy, fear of death. By putting his characters in ridiculous situations, Molière wants to entertain and educate his audience."
"One of his most important plays is ""Tartuffe"", showing a bigoted man stealing his way into a rich family. Molière's last play was ""Le Malade Imaginaire"", called in English ""The Hypochondriac"". As in many of his comedies, Molière played the main role. He died on stage during the fourth performance. Because of his problems with the church, he was not allowed to be buried in a church cemetery."
Principality of Sealand
"The Principality of Sealand is an unrecognized micronation that claims HM Fort Roughs (also known as Roughs Tower) as its territory. Roughs Tower is an offshore platform in the North Sea around off the coast of Suffolk. Roughs Tower was used as a sea fort in international waters during World War II. Since 1987, the tower has been occupied by the family and associates of Paddy Roy Bates, a former British Army major. Bates took the tower from pirate radio broadcasters in 1967. Sealand was invaded by mercenaries in 1978. Sealand was able to defeat the attack. The platform has been in British territory since 1987, when the United Kingdom made its territorial waters larger."
History.
"In 1943, during World War II, HM Fort Roughs (sometimes called Roughs Tower) was built by the United Kingdom as one of the Maunsell Forts. Its main goal was to protect the nearby shipping lanes from German mine-laying vehicles. It held 150–300 Royal Navy personnel throughout World War II. The last time it was used by the Royal Navy was in 1956."
Occupation and creation.
Roughs Tower was used in February and August 1965 by Jack Moore and his daughter Jane. They used it as a base for Wonderful Radio London.
"Major Paddy Roy Bates took the fort on 2 September 1967 to use it for his own pirate radio station (Radio Essex). However, he never starting broadcasting. Instead, he declared the independence Roughs Tower as the Principality of Sealand."
"In 1968, British workmen entered the claimed territorial waters of the Principality of Sealand to fix a buoy near the platform. Michael Bates (son of Patty Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the platform. As Bates was a British subject at the time, he was called to court on firearm charges after the incident. However, the court said that the platform was outside of British waters and the case could not continue."
"In 1975, Bates introduced a constitution for Sealand, followed by a national flag, a national anthem, a currency and passports."
1978 attack.
"In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who said he was the prime minister of Sealand, hired many Dutch and German mercenaries to attack Sealand while Bates and his wife were in Austria. They took the platform and took Bates' son Michael hostage. Michael was able to escape and take back Roughs Tower using weapons stored on the platform. Achenbach was charged with treason. He was held there unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000). Germany sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. He was released after many weeks of negotiation. Roy Bates claimed that the diplomat's visit meant that Germany had ""de facto"" recognized Sealand."
2006 fire.
"On the afternoon of 23 June 2006, the top platform of Roughs Tower caught fire because of an electrical fault. A Royal Air Force helicopter took one person to Ipswich Hospital. The Harwich lifeboat stayed nearby Roughs Tower until a local fire tug extinguished the fire. All damage was repaired by November 2006."
Attempted sale.
"In January 2007, The Pirate Bay, an online media index founded by the Swedish think tank Piratbyrån, tried to buy Sealand after harsher copyright laws forced them to look for a new headquarters. Between 2007 and 2010, Sealand was offered for sale through the Spanish estate company ImmoNaranja at a price of €750 million (£600 million, US$906 million)."
Death of founder.
"Roy Bates died at the age of 91 on 9 October 2012. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for many years. He was succeeded by his son Michael. Michael Bates lives in Suffolk, where he and his sons run a family fishing business called Fruits of the Sea. Joan Bates, Roy Bates's wife, died in an Essex nursing home at the age of 86 on 10 March 2016."
Legal status.
"In 1987, the UK increased its territorial waters from . Sealand is now in British territorial waters."
Administration.
"Sealand is ruled by the Bates family as its royal family. Roy Bates called himself ""Prince Roy"" and his wife ""Princess Joan""."
"As part of the creation of the Muni Metro system, streetcar operation switched to light rail operation in 1981 – the last line to do so. While many streetcar lines switched to bus lines after World War II, the J Church avoided this due to the private right-of-way it uses between 18th Street and 22nd Street."
Extension to Balboa Park.
"The outer end of the line was originally at Church and 30th Streets. It was where streetcars used a triangle of railroad track to turn back. Studies to further the line from its southern terminus had been made in the 1920s and 1970's. In 1990–91, the tracks were extended to the Balboa Park BART station and the Metro Center (Muni light-rail base), giving J-line cars a much shorter connection to the yard than before. The extension opened on August 31, 1991. But the new section was used only by light rail cars starting or ending their runs; all-day J-line service was not use the new tracks until June 19, 1993."
K Ingleside
"The K Ingleside is a light rail line of the Muni Metro system in San Francisco, California. It mostly serves the West Portal and Ingleside neighborhoods. Opened on February 3, 1918, it was the first line to use the Twin Peaks Tunnel."
Route description.
"The K Ingleside line stops at concrete boarding islands in the middle of the street next to the tracks. Some stops have raised platforms for accessibility. Stations between West Portal and Embarcadero is only served by the outbound K. But, not the inbound K, as it switches to T at West Portal."
Operation.
"The K Ingleside begins service at 5 a.m. weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays, with the end of service around 12:30 a.m. each night. Trains on the weekdays are scheduled to come every 10 minutes. Trains on the weekends are scheduled to come every 12 minutes."
History.
Municipal Railway.
"The San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) opened its K line along with the Twin Peaks Tunnel on February 3, 1918. The line ran from St. Francis Circle station along West Portal Avenue, through the tunnel, along Market Street to Van Ness Avenue (joining the J Church at Church Street). And along existing tracks on Van Ness Avenue to Pine Street. On June 1, 1918, the J and K lines were removed from Van Ness Avenue and went further along Market Street to a loop at the Ferry Building."
Changes in 1980s.
"More changes to the service route followed until finally on December 17, 1980. It was when the K line was light rail operated, with service from Embarcadero Station to Balboa Park, on weekdays only. Weekend service continued to use PCC cars until September 1982. This was when the Muni Metro became fully operational."
Changes in 2000s.
"From February 2001 to June 7, 2003, K Ingleside service was cut back to St. Francis Circle. It was also replaced by buses on Ocean Avenue for street repaving, and route reconstruction along Ocean Avenue."
"Following service changes on June 30, 2007, the K Ingleside and the T Third Street lines were combined inside the Market Street subway tunnel. Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."
L Taraval
"The L Taraval is a light rail line of the Muni Metro system in San Francisco, California. The line is currently not operating and replaced by buses through the end of 2024 for reconstruction along Taraval Street."
Route description.
"The line begins at Wawona and 46th Avenue station (near the San Francisco Zoo), which is on a one-way loop on Vicente Street, 47th Avenue, Wawona Street, and 46th Avenue. It runs north on 46th Avenue to Taraval Street, then runs east on Taraval Street to 15th Avenue. The line then runs south one block on 15th Avenue, then east on Ulloa Street to West Portal station, where it tags along with all the other Muni Metro lines towards Embarcadero station."
Operation.
"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the L Taraval operates 7 days a week, with train service beginning at 5 a.m. weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays and running until 12:30 a.m."
History.
"Muni's L Taraval line opened as a shuttle from West Portal to 33rd Avenue on April 12, 1919. It went further west along Taraval Street to 48th Avenue at Ocean Beach on January 14, 1923; that October 15, the shuttle service was replaced with larger streetcars running through to the Ferry Building. The L Taraval went south (turning off Taraval at 46th) to the San Francisco Zoo, the line's current outer terminus, on September 15, 1937. Every other streetcar line was routed to the new Transbay Terminal on January 15, 1939; they went back to the Ferry Building on January 1, 1941, but the Transbay Terminal became the inner terminal for all streetcars on June 6, 1948."
Light rail operation.
"The L switched to light rail operations as part of the opening of the Muni Metro system in 1980. While many streetcar lines switched to buses operations after World War II, the L Taraval remained a streetcar line due to its use of the Twin Peaks Tunnel."
L Taraval Improvement Project.
"The L Taraval Improvement Project, originally called the L Taraval Rapid project, was to improve street safety and speed up trains."
"L Taraval Improvement Project construction began in August 2019. In September 2019, construction on the first phase of the project began. It took place between Sunset Blvd and 46th Avenue. The first phase was completed in July 2021. The second phase began in January 2022, with the second phase of the construction project taking place from Sunset Blvd to Ulloa St near West Portal station. This phase is expected to last through 2024."

Soundtrack.
"Singer and songwriter Adam Duritz from Counting Crows said that his band's song, ""Accidentally in Love"", ""fits into the movie because it's the story of people who fall in love who weren't supposed to fall in love."" Composer James Horner operated the sound of the score on different levels which James said as ""Fun"". His score came out as an Eels song into a romantic scene with Shrek and Fiona, or a funny scene with Donkey. George Bruns did not compose the film score with Horner, due to a conflict."
Automobili Turismo e Sport
"ATS (Automobili Turismo e Sport, which roughly translates in English to ""Tourism and Sports Cars"") was an Italian car maker and briefly, a constructor in Formula One. The team ran in F1 in 1963, and made cars from 1963 to 1965. The company was founded by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, intended to compete directly with Ferrari."
"The two most well-known cars were the ATS 2500 GT, a sports car, and The Tipo 100, a Formula One car, which was a virtual copy of the Ferrari 156, which was a Formula One car in 1961. Unfortunately, with the cars being frequently withdrawn and technical problems through the season, the F1 team was shut down after 1963. In fact, out of the 10 entries ATS qualified for (Five races, two cars per race), only two cars were classified at the end of the race, albeit very slow, with Giancarlo Baghetti being classified at 23 laps down (23 laps behind the eventual race winner, Jim Clark). By contract, Phil Hill (with no relation to Graham Hill) finished seven laps down."

Framlingham
"Framlingham is a small town in the Suffolk Coastal local government district of Suffolk, England."
"Framlingham Castle is a large hill-top castle found in the town. It has a population of 3,114 at the 2001 census. There used to be a railway station there but it is now closed."
Westerfield
"Westerfield is a small village near Ipswich in Suffolk. It is about two miles north of the centre of Iswich. The village is served by Westerfield railway station on the Ipswich-Lowestoft East Suffolk Line. The village is home to two pubs, as well as the church, shown adjacent."
"The area of the Village south of the railway is inside the borough of Ipswich, although the area North of the railway is inside Suffolk coastal. The railway is around 500 metres from the centre of the village The railway service provides Ipswich, Felixstowe and Woodbridge, and further afield."
"The village holds a Scout fete, and a church fete, each year. These fetes include traditional games, incorporating many locals from in and around the local area."
"The Village used to be home to a local primary school, as well as a small post office. Despite this the village is still home to a nice village hall, that is home to the 1st Westerfield scout group, as well as a Beaver and Cub group."
"Despite this there are speeding issues along Westerfield road, driving through the centre of the village."
Cocculus carolinus
"Cocculus carolinus otherwise known as ""Carolina Coralbead"", ""Redberry Moonseed"" or the ""Carolina snailseed"". It is indigenous to several states along the South to Midwest. It gets its name from the bright red color of the marble like berry that protrudes from the leaves of the plant."
Description.
"The Carolina Coralbead is a deciduous, woody vine that can twines along the trunks of several trees or along the ground. It occurs in timberline areas, rocky woods, glades, fence rows and ponds. Carolina Coralbead can grow 10–12 ft (3–3.6 m) and usually spaced within 3–4 ft (90–120 cm) of one another. If ingested in large amounts, the berry on Cocculus carolinus can be poisonous, but the overall toxicity of its berries do not prove to be fatal. In areas in Little Rock, Arkansas, the Carolina Coralbead is referred to as an invasive weed system which seedlings have been spread by birds. Once a root system has been established, it is hard to remove the plant, so planting in new areas has been a point of concern for this plant. The best ornamental features of the plant are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall. ""Cocculus carolinus"" can grow in temperatures between from -3.8 °C (25 °F) to -28.8 °C (-20 °F). Its leaves are covered in short hairs and should not be confused with the species ""Smilax bona-nox"",which has tendrils and prickles."
Description.
The house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14–18 centimeters (5.5–7.1 in) long. It weighs between 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.4 oz). Females are smaller than males.
"Male and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings."
Habitat.
"The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year."
"Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines."
Conservation.
"The number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."
Sparrows in Mao's China.
"Sparrows eat some grain. So Mao decided that sparrows should be eliminated in China. The result was a disastrous famine, with grain yields a fraction of what went before. Apparently no-one knew enough about sparrows. They are major predators of locusts. With few sparrows, locusts thrived and ate much of the wheat. It is difficult in an autocracy to tell leaders they are wrong."
Couch
"A couch, sofa or settee is a kind of furniture that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest."
"Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age."
Expression.
"Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a ""couch potato"". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word ""couche"", which means, ""a bed, lair,"" or from the word ""coucher"", which means ""to lie down."""
Types.
"The most common types of couches in homes are the ""love seats"" for two, or the ""sofa"" for more than two. Other couches include the ""divan"" or the ""fainting couch"", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch."
Jena Lee
"Jena Lee (born 29 July, 1987 in Chile) is a French singer."
"She was adopted by a French family at the age of nine months. In 2007, Jena Lee met Sulee B Wax, who was interested in her work. At this point in time Lee wrote the song ""Some Share"". The song was used in an album by Sherifa Luna. Jena Lee wrote six out of the thirteen songs that are on Sherifa Luna's album."
"In 2008, Jena Lee won the Urban Music Nation contest by Skyrock. Her first single ""J'aimerais Tellement"" was released in April 2009 along with a music video. It was at the top of the French single charts for eleven weeks. It had the highest number of downloads in November 2009."
Sinik
Sinik (real name Thomas Gerard Idir; born on 26 June 1980) is a famous French rapper. His parents are Algerian. Thomas was four years old when his parents moved to Bergères in France.
Porridge
"Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats. The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish. Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added."
"Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe. It is usually eaten for breakfast. In some countries barley or other grains may be used. Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave. Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons. This is why in English there is a slang expression ""doing porridge"" which means ""being in prison"". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest."
"Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat."
"After some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults."
Species.
"How fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."
Zeulenroda-Triebes
Zeulenroda-Triebes is a German town in the rural district of Greiz in Thuringia.
"It has about 18,000 inhabitants. Most famous sight of the town is the beautiful town hall."
Harry Nilsson
"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 - January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter."
"Nilsson was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City. His paternal grandparents were Swedish."
"""Without her"" is one of his early hits. This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include ""Me And My Arrow"", ""Coconut"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Spaceman"", and ""One"". ""One"" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were ""Without You"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"". These songs were written by other people. ""Without You"" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was used in the 1969 movie ""Midnight Cowboy"". The song was written by Fred Neil."
"Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of ""You Can't Do That"". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music."
"Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named ""The Point!"". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. ""The Point!"" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, ""Cuddly Toy"" and ""Daddy's Song"", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas."
"Nilsson died of heart failure in Agoura Hills, California."
"The movie ""You've Got Mail"" uses several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack."
Acoustic guitar
"An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (""pick""), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles."
How the guitar became a popular instrument.
"The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar."
Guitar and ukulele compared.
"The guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."

Coral fungi
"Coral fungi or clavarioid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs. They are rubbery and at times are brightly coloured."
"Originally, such fungi were put in the genus ""Clavaria"", and called ""clavarioid"", which means ""Clavaria""-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of ""clavarioid fungi"", and it is frequently used in research papers."

"He knew that Cook was not ugly and that audiences would have to accept the idea and pretend: ""You either go along with it or you don't go along with it."" He compared it to how Clark Kent changes into Superman. Instead of making a real change from ugly to pretty, he said it was more important to find an actress who could show the different changes in her personality and feelings."
"Filming took place in various places in California. The highschool scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Beverly Hills, 90210 had also filmed."
"Iscove was also a choreographer before he was a director and wanted to include dancing in the movie. He wanted show his bosses the Weinsteins, that musical numbers could work in modern movies.

Muhammad
"Muhammad ( – 8 June 632) was an Arab religious, political and social leader. He founded the religion of Islam."
"Born in Mecca, Muhammad's parents died in his childhood and he grew as an orphan. At the age of six, his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib took care of him, though he died just two years later. In young life, Muhammad accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on trade trips. In 610 AD, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was praying, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Quran. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. He started preaching monotheism publicly where he received opposition from the Meccan polytheists. The polytheists boycotted Muhammad for three years, in which Muhammad could barely eat or drink. He was attacked with stones, ridiculed while praying, and eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca."
"While Muhammad was traveling towards Medina, he came across Taif and preached there where polytheists threw stones, causing Muhammad to bleed and almost collapse. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and made a mosque there."
"He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (""the seal of the prophets""). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow."
Life.
Childhood.
"Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life."
Beginning of the prophethood.
"In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:"
"""Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."""
"Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ""down"" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam."
The Hijrah.
"After Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ""Hijrah"". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely."
"As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr."
His stay in Medina.
"Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house."
The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.
Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.
The wars.
"The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed."
"But, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured."
"No one lives in the town, the closest people live at Farina station, a farm, west of the town. A bush camping area has been set up by the owners of Farina station."
Volunteers have repaired the bakery and put up information signs.
Cemeteries.
"The town's cemetery is a few kilometres from the town. It has an Afghan corner with several headstones, some with both English and Arabic writing. These mark the graves of former Farina residents of Afghan origin who were part of the Afghan camel trains which used to provide transport services before the railway. All the gravestones face Mecca in the Islamic tradition."

Early life and career.
"Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (née Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played ""dance band music"". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician."
"In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed ""Moonlight Serenade"". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, ""Room 1411"", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook."
"In the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs ""Annie's Cousin Fannie"", ""Dese Dem Dose"", ""Harlem Chapel Chimes"", and ""Tomorrow's Another Day"" in 1934 and 1935.

Success from 1938 to 1942.
"Miller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a ""sound"" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands."
"Miller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams."

Kona coffee
"Kona Coffee is one of the kinds of coffee that is made in Kona, Hawaii. And it is famous for being the second most expensive coffee in the world following the Blue Mountains. It is too rare and accounts for only less than 0.1% of all coffee production all over the world."
History.
"In 1825, the person who was one of the royal family of Hawaii went to Britain with the king of Hawaii and brought coffee plants on the way home. Those plants spread to many regions of Hawaii. In 1828, coffee plants were planted in the Kona region. After that, many farms were made there. But, because of pest damage and the price decline of coffee, most farmers quit their jobs. In this situation, Japanese immigrants moved to the Kona region and started to grow coffee to pay their land cost by coffee. This is the beginning of kona coffee. Now, Kona coffee is drunk at the dinner party in White House because this is the only coffee that is grown in America and the quality is quite high."
Distribution.
"Kona is one of the districts of Hawaii, and it is located western. Also,it is the only place which grows coffee in the U.S. states. It has a good natural environment for growing coffee thanks to some volcanoes that give soil many nutrients. Also, the unique oceanic climate of the Kona region, which is cooler and rains a lot more than that of flat ground, is good for growing coffee. Furthermore, there is a terroir that is called “ Kona coffee belt” that is around 32 km long and 3.2 wide area. In this territory, there are many farms and shops that sell Kona coffee directly from the farms and as much as 900,000 kg of coffee beans are harvested annually."
Kona blends and Flavor coffee.
"There are some blended Kona coffees that are made by mixing some kinds of coffee beans because 100% Kona coffee is quite expensive because of labor and land cost. In the Hawaii-grow coffee law, blended coffee that accounted for 10% of Kona coffee beans can be called Kona blended coffee. The coffees that have extra flavor like macadamia nut, vanilla and so on are also famous. Those flavor coffees are made by adding flavor during roasting."
Taste.
"This coffee has a less bitter taste and softly sourness. Because of its great sourness, this coffee is called “Queen of sourness”. You can feel the sweet and fresh smell like tropical fruits. Also Kona coffee is graded 5 stages according to the size of the beans. The bigger beans are graded better and those coffee beans have better taste. The biggest coffee beans are called “extra fancy” and there are only 15 % of Kona coffee. Following “fancy”, “No 1”, “select”, “prime”. Other coffee beans are called “ Hawaiian coffee”. Also, there are coffee beans which are called Peaberry. It is round beans although originally one is half round. Those coffee beans contain more nutrition."

She is the daughter of Lairen Humchouba. She is one of the divine incarnations of Leimarel Sidabi. She is one of the most important Umang Lais. Her pantheon is maintained particularly by the Taibungjam clan of Meitei ethnicity.
Etymology.
"In Meitei language (Manipuri language), the female first name ""Laikhurembi"" can be split up into three parts, ""Lai"", ""Khu"" and ""-rembi"". The Meitei language word ""Lai"" has multiple meanings. It may mean a god or a deity or a spirit or a disease or a picture or a painting in noun form. ""Lai"" may mean in adjective form in Meitei language. The Meitei language term ""Khu"" also has many meanings. It may mean """" or ""not "" in adjective form. It may mean a knee in noun form. It may mean ""to "" or ""to "" in verbal form. According to ""The History Of Manipur"" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" are the names of tribes. The last part ""-rembi"" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form."
History and Origin.
"According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on."
"Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" people in it. Other scholars think ""Laikhurembi"" is just her title and not her name."
"Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, : Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Lai-ren"" means ""Chief of Lai"". In Meitei language, the word ""Lai"" has many meanings."
"Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"" and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Description.
"The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was ""Yungyatnaba"" (lit. ""erect and sharp"") which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (""things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement"")."
"No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden."
"In 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60–65, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as ""Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease""."
Famous cases.
"Anyone can get Alzheimer's disease, rich people or poor famous people and unfamous people. Some of the famous people who have gotten Alzheimer's disease are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities got worse with the disease."
"Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskás, the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Suárez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the Nobel Prize-winner Raymond Davis, Jr., the actors Charlton Heston and Gene Wilder, the novelist Terry Pratchett, politician and activist Sargent Shriver, the Blues musician B.B. King, director Jacques Rivette, Indian politician George Fernandes,"
"and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao. In 2012, Nobel Prize writer Gabriel García Márquez was diagnosed with the disease. Former Finnish President Mauno Koivisto died of the disease in May 2017. Country singer Glen Campbell died of the disease in August 2017."
Elaine Paige
"Elaine Paige OBE (born Elaine Jill Bickerstaff, 5 March 1948) is an English actress and singer. She was born and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, in 1948. She is known for her roles in musical theater."
Life.
"She worked in the theatre from a young age. She quickly became famous in the role of Eva Perón in the musical ""Evita"" in 1978. She studied acting at the Aida Foster stage school in London and then played roles in the British tour of the show ""The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd"" and the first London production of ""Hair"". She played Sandy in the London production of ""Grease"" and appeared as one of Michael Crawford's girlfriends in ""Billy"". She has since said she was about to leave the world of acting, possibly to become a teacher, but then the role in ""Evita"" was offered to her."
"After ""Evita"", she did not have any work for a period. She thought that her musical career had seen its best. When the actress Judi Dench had an injury during rehearsals for ""Cats"", the producers asked Paige play the role in stead of Dench. They stated that the role ""was not another ""Evita"""" and that her role only had one and a half songs. Fortunately, the song was ""Memory"", which was a top 10 hit for Paige and has become her signature song."
"After ""Cats"", she appeared in ""Abbacadbra"", an ABBA compilation, and ""Chess"", also written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA but with lyrics by Tim Rice, co-writer of ""Evita"". Paige then scored a number 1 single, ""I Know Him So Well"", a song from ""Chess"", as a duet with Barbara Dickson."
"In 1989, she co-produced and starred in a production of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" in London, which made a star of John Barrowman. In the early 1990s, her term relationship with the lyricist Tim Rice stopped and Paige tried an image change by recording an album with a California-based producer in the Bette Midler torch singer vein entitled ""Love Can Do That"". Her solo albums had so far been a variety of songs, including the very successful ""Stages"" in 1983, with songs from musical theatre. In 1993, she returned to the United States to work with Peter Matz on an album called ""Romance and the Stage"" featuring songs from earlier days of musical theatre. The following year, she recorded, ""Piaf"", which had music from the role she was playing in the Pam Gems play, also called ""Piaf"". Critics were impressed by her acting skills in that play."
"However, in 1995 she had a role in another musical, playing Norma Desmond in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Sunset Boulevard"". She had always wanted to perform on Broadway and ""Sunset Boulevard"" now made this possible. For more than a year she played the role. She later had another role in 2000 with the ""King and I"". She has recently moved more into television and radio work."
Paige was awarded an OBE in 1995. Now she is hosting a Sunday afternoon BBC Radio 2 show which plays music from the stage and film.

"The dance is thought to have come from about 5,000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the world. The people (almost always girls in hanboks) would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring a good harvest."
"In the 16th century, when the Japanese were attacking Korea, Korea's Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance. He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into overestimating them. The women were said to have worn military uniforms and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산)."
"On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was included in the list of the ""Important Cultural Properties of Korea"" #8."
Description.
"Traditionally, this dance performed without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, hold hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line. Then, the rest of the people all sing, 'ganggangsullae'. Then the lead singer sings another line, and the rest of the people reply, 'ganggangsullae'. This is probably where the name of the song came from. As the dance continues, the tempo of the song can get faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and wants. During the dance, the women also play some games. The ganggangsullae can last until dawn."
Easter Bilby
The Easter Bilby is an Australian alternative to the Easter Bunny. Bilbies are an endangered species of Australian marsupials. Bilby shaped chocolates are sold in many Australian shops to raise money to help protect the bilbies.
"Author Rose-Marie Dusting wrote a book in 1979 called ""Billy, the Aussie Easter Bilby"". Some of the money from each book sold goes to helping the bilbies."
"The Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia began to use the Easter Bilby concept in 1991. They wanted to show the damage that rabbits do to the Australian environment. The ideas was taken up by an Easter egg company, Darrell Lea. They give a portion of their profits to the foundation."
"Australian children's book author and illustrator Irena Sibley produced three Easter Bilby books between 1994 and 2000 including the best selling ""The Bilbies' First Easter""."
John Richard Hicks
"Sir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist. He contributed to the fields of consumer demand theory in microeconomics. In 1937, he developed the IS/LM model which summarizes a Keynesian view of macroeconomics. His book ""Value and Capital"" (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory. The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him."
He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1964.
In 1972 he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly) for his pioneering contribution to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory.

History.
"God Panam Ningthou has his major cult center in Andro village. The Andro village in Imphal East district of present day Manipur is an ancient village. People of this village worship fire that is kept burning from the time of Poireiton Khunthokpa (34 BC-18 BC). The fire is kept in the Chakpa Panam Ningthou Meihoupirol (lit. ""Panam Ningthou sacred burning fireplace"")."

"According to Thomas Callan Hodson (T.C. Hodson), Panam Ningthou is a rain and weather God of the Meitei people of Manipur. He recorded his description in his monograph The Meitheis published in 1908."
Mythology.
"When it was one or two days before the Lai Haraoba festival of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou begins, the God came to his temple in the form of a ball of light. He came flying from the east. He landed at a part of the Nongmaiching Hill. Sometimes, some people of Andro claimed to see that ball of light, even at other times of the year."
"God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou has a wife named Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi. Some people believed that she might be of Burmese origin. So, the God went to Burma () to meet her from time to time."
Festival and worship.
God Panam Ningthou is mainly worshipped by the people of Loi caste of Meitei ethnicity in Manipur. He has his major cult center in Andro village of Imphal East district of Manipur.
"Shakespeare noted that the Loi people regarded God Panam Ningthou as a special deity of the Meitei king. He further noted that the King himself provided sacrificial animals to the God. Buffalo was one among the sacrificial animals used to be sacrificed during the Lai Haraoba festival. Pigs were sacrificed when there was no Lai Haraoba festival. Whenever there was any suspicion of danger to the Meitei king, the King would send a pig and a cock to be sacrificed to God Panam Ningthou of Andro."
"The Chakpa Haraoba (one of the 4 types of Lai Haraoba festival) is annually celebrated in honor of God Panam Ningthou. The festive occasion falls in the Meitei lunar month of Lamta (""March-April interface month""). The festival starts from the first Sunday of the ""Lamta"" month."
"During the 9 day long festival, no outsiders of Andro are allowed to stay at the village. In modern times, notice is issued one month before the festival begins through mass media like television, newspaper and radio. The notice informs outsiders to leave the place as it is about to begin the festival. Natives of Andro may come to Andro before the festival starts. Once the festival begins, no one is allowed to either leave from or come to the village. People who have converted into another religion are not allowed to participate in the religious festival even if they are native of Andro. There are some Christian converts and Hindu converts in Andro."
"During the festival, people of ""Andro village"" wear black clothes as a custom. Besides Panam Ningthou, there are twelve other deities worshipped in Andro. During the Lai Haraoba festivals of these deities, outsiders of Andro can witness the event. The festivals in their honor are done separately from that of Panam Ningthou. But the festival of Pureiromba can be done together with that of Panam Ningthou. At this too, outsiders can witness the event but the place of worship is different from the exclusive one of Panam Ningthou."
"During the Haraoba of Panam Ningthou, there is no shortage of meat and wine. Boys and girls play important role in the festival."

Association with other gods.
"According to the Thalon text, Panam Ningthou was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill. The cults of these five gods were integrated into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom clan."

Bassoon
"The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instruments of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a ""crook"" or ""bocal"" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef."
"Some bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called ‘Heckel’). French bassoons (called ‘Buffet’) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system."
"The Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra. In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra."
Playing the bassoon.
"To play the bassoon, it is very important to have lots of breathing support. Like with the oboe, fast passages can be played using double tonguing (single tonguing is like saying “tu-tu-tu-tu-tu”, double tonguing is like saying “te-ke-te-ke-te-ke”). In most music, the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line, perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba. It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an “um-cha-um-cha” accompaniment like in the “Dance of the Cygnets” from Tchaikovsky’s ""Swan Lake"". It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakov’s ""Sheherazade"". Listen to the opening of Stravinsky’s ""Rite of Spring"" where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais or the English Horn. Even a famous composer, Saint Saëns, did not know what the instrument was. Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfather’s tune in ""Peter and the Wolf"". Also, to play the bassoon, a player needs big hands because the bassoon's keys and holes are quite wide."
"New Mills most known employer is Swizzels Matlow, who make children's sweets. The company transferred to New Mills from London during the Blitz. Famous brands include ""Parma Violets"", ""Refresher"" chews, ""Drumstick"" lollies and - perhaps most famously - ""Love Hearts"""

"Vancouver, Washington"
"Vancouver, Washington is a United States city, just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington. It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. The city of Vancouver includes Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington State."
History.
"The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area ""land of the mud turtles"" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver."
"Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway."
"Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon."
Geography and Climate.
"Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011)."
"Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver."
"Vancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west."
Architecture and Buildings.
"The National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit. Because it is the oldest city in the area, Vancouver has a wide variety of buildings, including:"
"Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures, rebuilt as they were in the 1830s."
Radiant heating
"Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas."
History of Radiant Heating.
"The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them."
"In Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means ""warm stone,"" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems."
Types of Radiant Heating.
Underfloor heating.
"The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems."
Culture.
"The way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures. Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls. It is their job to do work which is physically hard, including fighting in the army when they are grown up. However, people’s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers (pants) while girls wear dresses or skirts. However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally. Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions."
"Traditionally boys like rough games (such as soccer or rugby) and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains. People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way society expects them to behave."
"The traditional colour for a boy is blue. For girls it is pink. When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle, according to whether it is a boy or a girl."
Names.
"Some names are boys’ names, others are girls’ names. There are some names which can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelt differently, e.g. “Lesley” for a boy and “Leslie” for a girl)."
"In some countries such as Britain an “old boy” means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. “He is an old boy of Cransbury High School”). The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. “Nice to see you, old boy!”."
Company clerk
"Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assists executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, scheduling meetings, and restocking supplies."
Paul McCartney
"Sir James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and composer. He is internationally known as a singer and bassist of the Beatles. With singer and guitarist John Lennon, he contributed music and lyrics to a lot of the band's songs."
Early Life.
"Paul was born at Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery (Past is Walton Hospital) in Walton, Liverpool, England, He was son of Jim and Mary McCartney, He had one brother is Michael McCartney and stepsister is called Ruth."
The Beatles (1962–1970).
"McCartney began writing songs before he was sixteen, and has written well over two hundred. His most famous song is ""Yesterday"", recorded by the Beatles in 1965. Since then around 2000 artists have recorded the song. Other songs written by McCartney for The Beatles include ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Penny Lane"", ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Let It Be""."
"Often, Beatles songs would have ""Lennon/McCartney"" written on the record, and it would look like that they had written it together. In fact, most Lennon/McCartney songs were written by only one of them, or with one adding only small parts to the other's work. Each counted on the other to help make their songs better, so they agreed to share the credit equally."
Solo music.
"Since the Beatles had stopped working together in 1971, McCartney started a new band called Wings with his wife Linda. Wings also had many hit records, including ""Band On The Run"" and ""Mull Of Kintyre"". McCartney wrote ""Live and Let Die"", which became the theme song to a James Bond film with the same title. Wings disbanded in 1981."
"Later McCartney recorded a single called ""Ebony and Ivory"" with Stevie Wonder, then ""The Girl is Mine"" and ""Say, Say, Say"" with Michael Jackson. A song with Jackson called ""The Man"" was released on McCartney's fifth solo album ""Pipes of Peace"". He and Jackson became friends, but this ended after Jackson outbid McCartney for ownership of the publishing company which owned most of the Beatles's music."
"McCartney had other hit songs, and also wrote and starred in the movie, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"", with Linda. The theme song from the movie, ""No More Lonely Nights"", was also a hit, but the movie did poorly, and McCartney's popularity suffered. He had to work hard to prove his talent was still strong. He co-wrote new songs with Elvis Costello, and began touring more often than he had in years."
"Along with popular music, McCartney also began composing classical music, including an oratorio about Liverpool. McCartney was knighted for his contributions to music and to British culture, and for his charity work. He bought John Lennon's former school, Quarry Bank, which he then turned into a performing arts school."
"In 1990, the minor planet 4148 was named ""McCartney"" in his honour. In 2010, he was honoured by President Barack Obama with the Gershwin Prize for his contributions to popular music. He returned to the White House later that year as a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2012, he became the last Beatle to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
Personal life.
"McCartney married Linda Eastman, a photographer, in 1969. She had a daughter, Heather, whom he adopted. McCartney and Linda had three more children together, named Mary, Stella and James. Stella became a popular fashion designer after she grew up."
"Linda died in 1998 of breast cancer (McCartney's mother also died from the same disease in 1956). He married model Heather Mills in 2002; the couple's child Beatrice was born in 2003. McCartney and Mills separated in 2006, and, after a long battle over a settlement, McCartney and Mills divorced in March 2008."
"McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell, 51, in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The couple had been dating since November 2007."
Paul is dead.
There was an urban legend that said that McCartney died in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike.
Discography.
Solo
"The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements."
"The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow-paced and lacked character development. ""Sleeping Beauty"" earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were laid off."

Gilles de Rais
"Gilles de Rais (1405 ?–26 October 1440) was a Marshal of France, Joan of Arc's comrade in arms, and a murderer. He was the son of Guy de Laval/Rais and Marie de Craon. He became rich when a relative died. He was made a Marshal of France in 1429. He spent much of his money putting on a play that he wrote. He dabbled in alchemy. His criminal career began in 1434. In 1440, he was arrested, tried, and hanged. De Rais may have killed 140 people. Most of his victims were young boys. He may have been the inspiration for the 1697 fairy tale ""Bluebeard"" by Charles Perrault."
Ligeia
"""Ligeia"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in ""The American Museum"" in 1838. It was revised and reprinted many times during Poe's lifetime."
"The story tells of an unnamed narrator's beautiful wife Ligeia. She composes the poem ""The Conqueror Worm"" before dying. The narrator then marries the Lady Rowena. She shortly sickens and dies. The narrator stays with her body overnight. She comes back from the dead as Ligeia."
"Criticism was positive. Charles Eames of ""The New World"" wrote, ""The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable."" Thomas Dunn English wrote in October 1845 that ""Ligeia"" was ""the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions""."
"In 1964, director Roger Corman adapted the story to a movie, ""The Tomb of Ligeia"", starring Vincent Price."
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar
"""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1845. The tale tells of a dying, mesmerized man whose body disintegrates once the trance is lifted. Poe was inspired to write the tale after reading a description of an operation performed upon a mesmerized patient. The tale has a great deal of gore, leading to the speculation that Poe had studied medical texts. ""Valdemar"" has been adapted to the movies and to radio drama."
Plot.
"The narrator mesmerizes an ill friend, M. Valdemar. Valdemar reports first that he is dying and then that he is dead. The narrator leaves him in a mesmeric state for seven months. During this time Valdemar is without pulse, heartbeat, or breath. His skin is cold and pale. Finally, the narrator tries to wake him. Valdemar's swollen black tongue begs to be returned to sleep or to be fully wakened. He shouts ""dead! dead!"" repeatedly. The narrator takes Valdemar out of the trance and his body immediately disintegrates into a ""nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."""
Publication history.
"Poe was inspired to write ""Valdemar"" after reading a letter about an operation on a mesmerized patient. The tale was published in December 1845 in two different New York journals. One used the title ""The Facts in M. Valdemar's Case"". In England, the tale was published first as ""Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis"" and later as ""The Last Days of M. Valdemar""."
Style.
"Poe employs detailed descriptions and high levels of gore in ""Valdemar"". He may have studied medical texts. Valdemar's eyes at one point leak a ""profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor"", for example. The tale's imagery is summed up in the final lines: ""...his whole frame at once — within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."" The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft. Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe's work, incorporating shock, disgust, and uneasiness into one moment. This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and, therefore, ultimately will be unsuccessful."
Adaptations.
"Movie adaptations include a segment in Roger Corman's ""Tales of Terror"" (1962) and George A. Romero's ""Two Evil Eyes"" (1990). ""Edgar Allan Poe's Valdemar"" (2000) was a dramatic adaptation for National Public Radio."

Freddy West Tjakamarra
"Freddy West Tjakamarra (previously Tjukurti Tjakamarra; born around 1932 – died 1994) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the very first painters of the Papunya Tula school."
Early life.
"Freddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert – most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping."
"At Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994."
Painting.
"West did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (""Tingari""), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide."
Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka
"Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka (late 1920s – 1999) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was one of the very first members of the Papunya Tula art movement. He is a well-known painter of Western Desert art. He belonged to the Pintupi community, and painted stories from the Pintupi Dreaming (""Tingari""). He painted mythological events that happened around his homeland, including around Winparrku, Lake MacDonald and Lake Mackay."
"Pinta Pinta was from Western Australia. He was born at Yumari, a place in the Great Sandy Desert. He was probably born sometime in the late 1920s (around 1927 or 1928). Before contact with White society, he lived a nomadic way of life in the desert. In the 1950s, he walked with his family to stay at Haasts Bluff, a government rations outpost. This was his first contact with modern Australian civilisation. His was one of the last groups in the country to come out of the desert."
"Pinta Pinta began painting in the mid-1970s, at Papunya. He moved to Kintore after it was founded in 1981. In 1984, Pinta Pinta and his family set up an outstation at Winparrku (Mount Webb), between Kintore and Kiwirrkurra. The family moved here shortly after. In 1988, he had a small part in the move ""Evil Angels""."
"His paintings mostly stick to black, white and ochre in colour. The most obvious motif seen in them is the circles and lines, which depict dreaming tracks. Some of his works are in the Australian Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory."
"He had two sons, Matthew (born early 1960s) and Nyilyari (born about 1965). Nyilyari also became a famous artist."
Coast
The coast is where land meets the sea.
"The coast also means the land next to the sea, which can also be called the shore, or sea-shore. However, coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land - it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land."
"If a house is near to the coast we say it is ""on the coast"". When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it ""the coast-line""."
"Sometimes, 'coast' can be part of a place name or the description of a large area. For instance, the East Coast of the United States describes the all of the Eastern side of the United States that is next to the Atlantic Ocean."
In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast.
Coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants.
An example of a coast in Great Britain is the Holderness Coast near Bridlington. This is one of Europe's fast eroding coasts.
George Harrison
"George Harold Harrison, MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. After the group broke up in 1970, he had a solo career. He made many albums and worked with other musicians including Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Ravi Shankar. He was also interested in Eastern mysticism and charitable causes."
Early life.
"Harrison was born in 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, He was youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison and Louise Harrison, He had one sister and two brothers."
Solo music.
"George's best-known album was ""All Things Must Pass,"" which he made just after the Beatles broke up. Harrison owned a mansion in England called Friar Park, where he lived from 1970 until he died. He built his own recording studio inside the mansion, which for a time was better than Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles had made their records. Having a private studio meant Harrison could work on songs and recordings anytime he wanted."
"Ravi Shankar came to Harrison during 1971 with news about a war in Bangladesh, where thousands of people had died and millions more were refugees and starving. Shankar asked for Harrison's help to give a benefit show to buy food for them. Harrison called on many of his musician friends, who put together a charity concert with famous people to help the refugees. The ""Concert for Bangla Desh"", a live recording, became a best-selling album, raised money for the refugees, and brought worldwide attention to the problems in their country. It also inspired later benefits, including Live Aid in the 1980s."
"Harrison found a new musical partner in the 1980s, when Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra began to write and record songs with him. The two men worked well together and became close friends. Harrison and Lynne formed another band, the Traveling Wilburys, with fellow musicians Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. The Traveling Wilburys recorded two albums, which became hits."
Personal life.
"In 1966, Harrison married a model, Pattie Boyd, but they were divorced in 1971, and had no children. Boyd left Harrison to be with his friend, guitarist Eric Clapton, but all three remained friends. Harrison married again in 1978, to American-born Olivia Trinidad Arias, who had worked for his record company. Arias became the mother of Harrison's son Dhani, whose name is comprised of the names of two notes in the Indian music scale. Dhani grew up to be a musician like his father, fronting the band thenewno2. He went to Brown University in the United States."
"In the late 1970s Harrison formed a movie production company, Handmade Films, which produced movies including Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" and Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits""."
"The grounds of Harrison's home, Friar Park, had been more or less open to the public, until the murder of his former bandmate John Lennon late in 1980. Harrison was very hurt and shocked by Lennon's death, and was afraid someone might try to harm him or his family. Afterwards, the gates were locked, and no-entry notices were posted. In December, 1999, an intruder broke into his home, stabbing him with a knife. Harrison and his wife Olivia stopped the intruder and called the police. Harrison recovered. The man who attacked him is schizophrenic and was acquitted of attempted murder by reason of insanity in November 2000 at Oxford Crown Court. He was sent to a mental hospital and released in 2002."
Death.
"In the 1990s, decades of smoking cigarettes caused Harrison to develop throat cancer. He later developed lung cancer, which caused his death in 2001. His family issued a last statement from him: ""Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another."" Even music was not as important to Harrison as his wanting people to learn to get along with each other, and to make the world a better place."
"A year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, the two remaining Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr), and other musicians held the ""Concert for George"", which remembered Harrison's music, his life, and his gifts to humanity. All the profits from the concert were given to charity."
Note (disambiguation)
Note has several meanings.
Ravi Shankar
"Ravi Shankar (7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012) was one of India's most famous musicians. Shankar was one of the first to bring aspects of traditional Indian music into Europe and United States|American culture in the 1960s. He was a major influence on George Harrison, who was a member of The Beatles. Shankar is famous for playing the sitar, an Indian stringed instrument. He performed until his death. In 2005 he played at The Proms. His daughters Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar are also well-known musicians."
Sentence
Producing output.
"Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages: Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page description language describes what a page should look like. The program in a page description language is sent to the printer, which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower level than Page description languages, they contain information that is specific to the printer model."
Common programming languages for printers include:
Cost of printers.
"When comparing the cost of a printer, people often talk about how expensive it is to print one page. This cost usually has three components:"
"Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers, but are not as expensive to use over a long period of time. Inkjet printers on the other hand cost more to use because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer."
"Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white. Some expensive printers can do other things such as print on both sides of the paper, automatically sort the output, or staple the pages."
Chasing Vermeer
Chasing Vermeer is a children's novel. It is about two children noticing strange coincidences relating to art. The book was written by Blue Balliett and published (printed) by Scholastic in 2003. It says many things about the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
"The sequel to the book is ""The Wright 3""."
Great Wall of China
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals."
"Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226–200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty."
History.
Great Wall of Qi was started in 685 BC. The state of Qi made a fortified wall for protection against the Southern states Ju og Lu and later from the kingdom Chu.
The state of Yan built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).
"The state of Zhao built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao."
"Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Hong, during his rule (221–206 BC)."
"The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China."
"By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria."
"Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place. Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth. It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall."
"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. It is made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old."
"The wall was built to help keep out northern invaders like the Mongols. Smaller walls had been built over the years, but the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, decided that he wanted a single giant wall to protect his northern borders. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by Ming Dynasty. Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was the only one who breached the Great Wall of China in its"

The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The Great Wall was declared as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall.
"Builders used materials that were nearby. Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. Workers dying and being buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth."
Visibility from space.
"Rumours about astronauts being able to see the Great Wall from the moon are scientifically not proven. The Great Wall has shown up in radar images taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall with a naked eye. One astronaut who spoke about the visibility of the Great Wall from space was Neil Armstrong. He said that on the moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. However, astronaut William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit distance (300-530 km height), but only with binoculars and with lots of practice."
"Genetic changes in bacteria might result in antibiotic resistance. They might be acquired through spontaneous mutations (vertical gene transfer) or through other bacteria passing their genes (horizontal gene transfer). Self-medications or improper medication use can result in the emergence of resistant bacteria. It is difficult to obtain new antibiotics, that is why researchers seek to improve existing ones, as well as working to discover new drugs."

Randy Rhoads
"Randall William ""Randy"" Rhoads (December 6, 1956 – March 19, 1982) was an American heavy metal guitarist. He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot."
Career.
Rhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.
"Dana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept ""an offer like this one"" and Rhodes replied ""Of course!"""
"He went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, ""I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'""."
"Rhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979. He stayed with Osbourne, his wife at the time Thelma, and their two children. After a short while, Lee Kerslake joined the band, which was at the time called The Blizzard of Ozz. The band recorded their debut album ""Blizzard of Ozz"" which was released on September 20, 1980 and became a success. ""Diary of a Madman"", their second studio album, was recorded between February and March 1981. It was released on November 7, 1981."
Death.
"Rhoads died on March 19, 1982. He was touring with his band at the time. While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane. The only person to witness the accident was keyboardist Don Airey."

Iran–Contra affair
"The Iran-Contra affair was a scandal that happened from August 1985 to March 1987. The scandal involved the United States Government selling weapons to Iran in exchange for hostages and to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. It happened under President Ronald Reagan's government. When 1,500 missiles were shipped three hostages were released but those three hostages were soon replaced with three more hostages. Secretary of State George Shultz called it “a hostage Bazaar”"
Oliver North was tried in court for the affair because he took the blame instead of Reagan. The court found North to be not guilty.
"On March 4, 1987, Reagan himself apologized to the American people and said it was all his fault. George H. W. Bush later pardoned anyone who was involved in the affair."
"While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause, the evidence is unclear as to whether he knew about the scandal."

"The club colours are blue and white. The combination of these has varied over time. It has led to their nickname ""The Bluebirds"". Attendances at the club's Holker Street field vary - the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954. But during the 1990s and 2000s, the average remained between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 1,590 during the 2008-09 season."

Notes
Eyre Coote (British Army officer)
Eyre Coote (20 May 1762 – 10 December 1823) was a British soldier and politician who was born in Ireland.
He was known as General Sir Eyre Coote until 1816; GCB 1815 - 1816.
Background.
"He was the second son of the Very Rev. Charles Coote (1713 - 12 February 1776), DD, Dean of Kilfenora. After studying at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, Coote bought a commission in the 34th Regiment of Foot - of which his uncle was colonel - in 1774."
"He was soon sent to North America to fight in the Revolutionary War. He fought in the Brooklyn in August 1776, as well as at Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth Court House before finally being taken prisoner at the final Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Between 1790 and 1798, he represented Ballynakill in the Irish House of Commons. Then he sat for Maryborough until 1800."
"He served in England and Ireland when they were threatened by French invasion and against the French on the Continent. He went on to serve in Holland, Egypt and eventually became Governor-General of Jamaica (1806–1808) where he possibly sired an ancestor of Colin Powell."
Scandal and death.
"Sir Eyre was removed from the service on the 21 May 1816 because of the scandal he caused in the Christ's Hospital school for boys. On 25 November 1815 he entered the school and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them. After that he asked them to flog him and gave them money. He was caught by the school nurse, and charged with indecent conduct before the Lord Mayor of London. He was acquitted after giving £1000 to the school: after that there was a military inquiry in April 1816 which stripped him of his rank and honours. He was appointed GCB 1815 and stripped of it 1816."
Pilum
A pilum was a type of spear. It was used by the Roman army. Pila were generally 2 metres long. They were made up of a wooden shaft and an soft iron point.
Tree frog
Tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees.
"There are several lines of Neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs. These groups are only distantly related, but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions. The result is that now there are species from different groups which look very much like each other. This is convergent evolution. It goes so far that in almost all cases, where one group occurs, another does not. Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of the groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared."
"The frogs do not normally come down to the ground, except to mate and spawn. Some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees as adults. In some species the eggs develop directly into adults; in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf."
"Many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage. Others are poisonous (poison dart frog), and display warning colouration."
"Blanc was born on May 30, 1908 in San Francisco, California. He studied at Lincoln High School in San Francisco. He was married to Estelle Rosenbaum from 1933 until his death in 1989. He has one son. Blanc died on July 10, 1989 from heart disease, at age 81."

IPod
"The iPod is a range of portable music players designed by the company Apple Inc. in California. The iPod comes with computer cables so that the user can put music from their computer onto the iPod, and play music from it using headphones. Newer iPods allow a user to play games, view pictures, watch videos and use the internet, too."
"The first iPod was named the iPod Classic. This iPod was released on October 23, 2001. Apple Inc. made the iPod like this until September 9, 2014."
"Apple made a smaller iPod called the iPod mini. It was much smaller than the iPod Classic, but did not hold as many songs. It used flash memory, a special kind of memory for very small electronics, instead of a hard drive. It was replaced by a version of the iPod called the iPod nano."
"Another type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, was very small, and it used flash memory, like the iPod mini but it had no screen. It was the least expensive iPod."
"The most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. It's very similar to the IPhone, but it's not a smartphone. The first generation of iPod touch was released on September 5, 2007 and was discontinued on May 10, 2022."
"iPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.) Songs are sold in AAC file format, not MP3 or WMA. These are popular formats for compressing (making smaller) music until it does not take up much space and can easily be put on a media player such as the iPod."
"The App Store is an online shop that is run by Apple Inc. where people can buy software for their iPhone or iPod Touch. It opened on July 11, 2008. Over 2 million applications (or apps for short) are available for people to buy. Some apps are available for free."
Costa Rica
"Costa Rica (officially called Republic of Costa Rica), is a country in Central America. It is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish. The official currency is the colón. It has enjoyed a long period of peace since the 1863 civil war. Because of its natural beauty and political stability, it is nicknamed the ""Switzerland of Latin America"". Costa Rica has had no army since December 1, 1948. Instead of spending money on the military, the government spends money on education and health."
"5,094,118 people live in Costa Rica. The capital city is San José. The current President is Carlos Alvarado Quesada. He was elected in 2018"
History.
Pre-Columbian period.
The indigenous people of Costa Rica belong to the Intermediate Area. This Intermediate Area is where the Mesoamerican and Andean indigenous cultures mixed together. The country was influenced by various Chibcha speaking indigenous people.
The impact of indigenous peoples' culture on modern Costa Rica has been small. The country did not have a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the indigenous population was absorbed into the Spanish colony. There are still some small indigenous groups. The largest is the Bribri and Boruca tribes in south Costa Rica.
Spanish colonization.
Christopher Columbus sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his last trip in 1502. He reported large amounts of gold jewelry among the indigenous people.
"During the colonial period, Costa Rica was the most southern province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. But it mostly ruled itself as a part of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition to trade with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the lack of gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor, little populated region of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was called ""the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America"" by a Spanish governor in 1719."
"Costa Rica's poverty was also because there were not enough indigenous people available for slavery. Most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land. There were no large ""haciendas"" (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was unappreciated and forgotten by the Spanish Crown. It had to develop on its own."
"Costa Rica became a ""rural democracy"" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a better climate."
Independence.
"Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the last Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica."
"Costa Rica joined the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide. After its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America. it existed from 1823 to 1839. It had a very loose authority over its provinces, especially the poor and remote Costa Rica."
"In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San José. This led to a brief battle with the old capital, Cartago."
"While civil wars were common in the Federal Republic of Central America, Costa Rica was largely peaceful."
"In 1838, Costa Rica formally proclaimed itself an independent country. The local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration."
Carolina parakeet
The Carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot.
"It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old woods along rivers."
"The last wild Carolina parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male bird called ""Incas"", who died within a year of his mate ""Lady Jane"". It was not until 1939, however, that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died."
"At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets. Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s."
Reasons for extinction.
"The Carolina parakeet died out for a number of reasons. To make space for more farms, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds were bred easily in captivity, little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests."
"Another reason that led to their extinction was that, unfortunately, they liked to return in large flocks to places where some of them had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock."
Match Game
"Match Game was a game show that ran from 1962 to 1999. Hosted Premierie on 1973 Present CBS GSN &amp; More Premierie June 26 2016 on ABC During $100,000 Pyramid Match Game The Hollywood Squares (1983) Like The Price is Right in Wheel of Fortune October 31 1983 on 1962-2016 Present Finale Until of 1979 in 1980-1982 in 1990 Theme in 1960s-2010s Like Pyramid"
Contestant Competition.
"First the challenging contestant would pick a question, A or B. Host Gene Rayburn would read it to the contestant. Then the contestant and the six celebrities would write their answer to the question on a piece of paper. Then after the contestant and the celebrities got done with their answer, Gene would ask for the contestant's answer. They would tell it to him. Then he would ask the celebrities for their answers. If the contestant's and a celebrity's answer are the same the contestant would get a point, and a green triangle would light up."
"Then the defending contestant would take the remaining question. Then the process was the same as above, except red circles lit up."
Whoever had the most points at after two rounds of the above procedures would win $100 and go on to the Big Money Super Match.
Big Money Super Match.
Audience Match.
"Before the game show, the audience would be surveyed. Their top 3 answers to the question (e.g. Road ___) would be worth (3rd most popular) $100, (2nd most popular) $250, and (most popular) $500. The contestant would pick 3 celebrities to give them answers they thought would be under the $500 slot. Then the contestant would choose one of those answers or make up their own. The answers were revealed one at a time."
Head-to-Head Match.
"If the contestant won the Audience Match, they would get a chance to win 10 times that money. They had to match a celebrity's answer exactly to questions like ____ Bee. At first, the contestant chose the celebrity they wanted to play with. In 1978, the Star Wheel was introduced. The contestant spun a wheel to determine which celebrity they would be playing with. If the wheel stopped on a gold star section, the money the contestant would be playing for was doubled."
Other versions.
"The first ""Match Game"" had different rules from this one and was shown on the NBC network starting in 1962 and ending in 1969. Then, this ""Match Game"" was introduced on the CBS network in 1973. That version ended in 1979. In 1975, a syndicated version titled ""Match Game PM"" started. It had three rounds of gameplay, and two Audience Matches in the Big Money Super Match. It ended in 1981. A second syndicated version with the same gameplay as ""Match Game PM"" started in 1979, and ended in 1982. In 1983, it was combined with another game show, ""Hollywood Squares"", to form the ""Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour"", which was on television for one year. Six years later, in 1990, it was brought back for the ABC network with a new host, Ross Shafer. In this version, contestants played for cash. It also featured a new round called the ""Match Up"" round. It was played at the end of both rounds. To start, a contestant chose one of the celebrities. The contestant had 30 seconds (45 in the second round) to match the celebrity in Super Match-style questions. Each question had two choices. Matches were worth $50 in the first round and $100 in the second. This version ended in 1991, but in 1998 it returned with Michael Burger as host. It featured five celebrities instead of six. This version was not very famous, however, and ended in 1999."

Euromaidan
"Euromaidan () was a period of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine. It began on the night of 21 November 2013 with protests demanding that Ukraine become part of the European Union. On 30 November 2013 riot police attacked protestors, violently putting a stop to the protests. The protesters then demanded the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. Many people were killed in the riots."
"Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the western part of the country, wanted to be part of the European Union. But President Yanukovych wanted to maintain close relationships with Russia. This angered pro-EU civilians. They started Euromaidan. On 30 November, the police intervened, sometimes violently. As a result, more people came out to protest. Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called ""Automaidan""."
The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued. In March 2014 the Russian Federation captured Crimea which angered many other nations. Some people feared this might lead to a global war.
Riots/revolution.
"As the riots continued, the protesters were attacked. Hundreds were killed or injured. Ukrainians got the freedom they wanted and a new government, although they have not yet entered into the European Union. Meanwhile Ukraine lost Crimea to Russia."
"Russia did not like that the Ukrainian government was overthrown as the new more nationalist and anti-Russian government did not favor them. Some of the people in the east, in the Donbas, preferred the old President, and declared independence and wanted to join Russia. Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the east, suffered in fighting."

Carbapenem
"Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics which act against a wide range of bacteria. Their structure is difficult for bacterial enzymes to break down. They were originally developed from a product of ""Streptomyces cattleya""."
"Carbapenems are one of the ""antibiotics of last resort"" for many bacterial infections, such as ""Escherichia coli"" (""E. coli"") and ""Klebsiella pneumoniae""."
"Recently, alarm has been raised about an ""Indian superbug"". This is a strain resistant to Carapenems, which was discovered in Delhi. This strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule."
"At present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems. However, some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems."
French Wars of Religion
"The French Wars of Religion were a total of eight wars that were fought in France in the 16th century. between Catholics and Protestants (also known as ""Huguenots""). In all of the wars until 1585, the Catholics were supported by the French kings."
First war.
"The first war started in 1562, when the Protestant Prince of Condé, Louis de Bourbon, fled Paris with his supporters and captured the city of Orléans. His army was defeated by the Catholics at the Battle of Dreux in December, and the Catholics placed Orléans under siege. During the siege, a Huguenot killed the Catholic leader, Duke Francis of Guise. A peace treaty was signed in March, ending the first war."
Second war.
"The second war began in 1567, when the Prince of Condé tried to kidnap King Charles IX in an incident known as the ""Surprise at Meaux."" Condé put Paris under siege, but the Catholics attacked his army and defeated him. The Protestants and the Catholics raised large armies, but there were no more major battles. In March 1568, another peace treaty was signed."
Third war.
"The third war began in 1568, when Condé and his ally, Gaspard de Coligny, suspected that the Catholics would try to murder them. They went south and raised an army. A Catholic army, led by the king's brother, Henry of Valois, who would later become Henry III of France, attacked them and won a victory at Jarnac. At the Battle of Jarnac, Condé was captured and executed. Coligny, now the leader of the main Protestant army, fought another battle against the Catholics at Moncontour. This battle, one of the deadliest of the era, was another Protestant defeat. Many of the Protestants withdrew into the fortress town of Saint Jean d'Angély, and the Catholics besieged them there. While the Catholics besieged Saint Jean d'Angély and lost thousands of troops, Coligny joined forces with the Protestant Count of Montgomery and his army. The Protestants marched across France and, in June 1570, defeated the Catholics at the Battle of Arnay-le-Duc. The Catholics, running out of money, made a peace treaty with the Protestants."
Fourth war.
"In 1572, the fourth war broke out when the Catholics, led by Henry of Valois and Henry of Guise, the son of Duke Francis, who was killed during the first war, killed Coligny and thousands of other Protestants during the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Many Protestant survivors fled to La Rochelle, one of the main centres of Protestantism in France. The Catholic army put La Rochelle under siege but could not conquer the city. After losing thousands of soldiers, the Catholics agreed to a peace treaty. Between the fourth and the fifth wars, King Charles IX died, and his younger brother, Henry, became King Henry III."

History.
"In 1891, William Henry Harris asked the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to build a railroad depot on a portion of his farm in order to create a village. A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in ""Harristown"". Harris owned every other lot in Harristown. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes were built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, people in the town created a local government as ""Ayden."" Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant. In 1922, the Mutual Building and Loan Association of Ayden was organized to help families obtain mortgages (or loan) to build homes in Ayden."

Megaron
"The megaron (, , plural ""megara"") is the rectangular great hall in Mycenaean and ancient Greek palace architecture. The hall was: 1) surrounded by four columns, 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open hearth venting through an oculus, or opening, in the roof."
"The megaron also had the throne-room of the ""wanax"", or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Near East but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the Aegean region. Megara are sometimes called ""long-rooms"" because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and rooms storing wine, oil and wheat."
"The megaron was used for sacrifices, royal events, and court meetings."
Structure.
"Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated from the ""megaroid"", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a ""pronaos"", a central ""naos"" (or ""cella""), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof was supported by wooden beams. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls were built with bricks of mud, and were decorated with frescoes. There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's ""Odyssey"" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks."
Examples.
"A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of Tiryns where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. The Cretan elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic images of bulls, a common animal motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this."

Saving Private Ryan
"Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American war movie directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat. Set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, the movie is known for its graphic portrayal of war and for the intensity of its second scene of 24 minutes, a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy landings.

"In 1996, producer Mark Gordon pitched Rodat's idea, which was inspired by the Niland brothers, to Paramount, which eventually began development on the project. Spielberg, who at the time was forming DreamWorks, came on board to direct the project, and Hanks joined the cast. After the cast went through training supervised by Marine veteran Dale Dye, the movie's photography started in June 1997 and lasted two months. The movie's D-Day scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland and used members of the Irish Army as infantry for the D-Day landing."
"Released on July 24, 1998, ""Saving Private Ryan"" received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances (particularly from Hanks), realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's direction, and was placed on many movie critics' 1998 top ten lists.

Additionally, it grossed $44 million from its release on home video in May 1999. The movie won several accolades, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Golden Globes, Producers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, and Critics' Choice Awards. The movie was nominated for eleven Academy Awards at the 71st Academy Awards, where it won five: Best Director (Spielberg's second), Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though it lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to ""Shakespeare in Love"" in a controversial Oscars upset."

Andes
The Andes are a mountain range along the western coast of South America.
"They stretch over 7,000 km / 4,400 miles from the south of Argentina and Chile to the north of Colombia. They are also found in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador."
The Amazon river system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes.
"The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world, and the second-highest after the Himalayas. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia."
"Aconcagua, the highest peak, rises to 6,962 m (22,841 ft) above sea level. The top of Mount Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center. Mount Chimborazo is an inactive volcano in Ecuador, which last erupted over a thousand years ago."
Geography.
The Andes has three sections:
"The northern part has two parallel ranges. They are the ""Cordillera Occidental"" (western) and the ""Cordillera Oriental"" (eastern). The term ""cordillera"" comes from the Spanish word meaning 'rope'."
"In Colombia, north to the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, western, central and eastern."
"In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Snowy Mountain Range of Saint Martha) is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,700 metres above sea level just 42 km from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range."
The western range of the eastern Cordillia Oriental is the only one which reaches Colombia .
"The Andes range is about wide throughout its length, except in Bolivia where it is wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, which lie in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela, represent the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range."
Geology.
The Andes are a Mesozoic–Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
"The Andes are the result of plate tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the South American continental plate. South America, like North America, has been moving west since the Cretaceous period. Thus the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate formed the Andes. This was caused by the westward movement of South America."
"The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic and Jurassic when Pangea begun to break up and several rifts developed. It was during the Cretaceous period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rock of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and weathering."
Climate.
"The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area, the altitude, and how close it is to the sea. The southern section is rainy and cool. The central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm, with an average temperature of in Colombia. The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The snow line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800–15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, going up to 4,800–5,200 m (15,800–17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then going down to on Aconcagua at 32°S, at 40°S, at 50°S, and only in Tierra del Fuego at 55°S; from 50°S, many of the bigger glaciers go down to sea level."
The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes.
Plants.
"Rainforests used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now reduced, especially in the Chocó and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. Farming, deforestation, illegal crops, and population growth has done this."
"A direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. That area, and many Interandean Valles, normally have deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric (dry) vegetation, up to the mostly lifeless Atacama Desert."
"About 30,000 species of vascular plants live in the Andes. About half of those are endemic to the region: it is a hotspot. The small tree ""Cinchona pubescens"" is a source of quinine used to treat malaria. It is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that came from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes."
"The play has been made into movies on numerous occasions. One movie stars Mickey Rooney as the fairy Puck. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera based on the play, George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton have both made ballets about it, and Felix Mendelssohn wrote many pieces of music for the play which include an ""Overture"" and a ""Wedding March""."

Vodka
"Vodka is a Russian alcoholic drink that is usually about 40% alcohol. It is clear (but can be flavoured), though it is sometimes mixed with other liquids before people drink it. It was first popular in the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe and former republics of the Soviet Union."
Things that are made into vodka.
Vodka can be made from different things:
The process to make vodka is:
"Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called ""akvavit"" (Latin ""aqua vitae"", ""water of life"") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled. When the vodka is bottled, it is ready for drinking."
History.
"Most people think the name ""vodka"" comes from the Slavic word for water in its diminutive form, ""little water"". The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405. The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8, 1751. It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka, as sources provide various views on this topic (though it's important to remember that the first mention of the word ""vodka"" in Cyrillic refers to a medicinal drink bought by the merchants of Kievan Rus from Poland). It is also worth noting that vodka was first used as medicine. When it became a popular drink, it was first known in Polish as ""gorzałka"" - from the Old Polish word ""gorzeć"", meaning burn. At first, gorzałka was a people's drink, but in the Slavic countries it soon became common among the nobility as well. it is worth noting that the common Ukrainian word for vodka is ""horilka"" which bears an extremely close resemblance to the Polish gorzalka. Both words roots have the same meaning (""hority"" - to burn; ""gorzeć"", also to burn)"
Different kinds of vodka.
"There are two basic kinds of Vodka: clear vodka and flavored vodka. Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better. Contrary to popular belief, flavoured vodka is not new - it has been a part of Polish drinking tradition for centuries. It is only relatively recently in history that clear and flavoured vodkas have found their way to Western countries such as the UK or US."
How vodka is consumed.
"Vodka is either drunk pure, or cocktails are made with it. The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice. Usually, vodka is drunk during a longer meal. Usually salty or sour things (not sweets) are served. In Poland and Russia (as well as some of their neighbours, such as Ukraine or Lithuania), vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams (0,1 litres) of vodka. The glass is usually emptied in one draught, while holding the breath. Directly afterwards something small is eaten. In most Eastern European countries it is consumed with pickled cucumbers. Before drinking, a toast is given."
Cultural.
"Vodka is a key element of Slavic tradition in some countries of Eastern Europe (especially Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). It has also spread to become a part of national culture in Baltic countries like Lithuania and Nordic countries like Sweden. It's traditional in Russia and other Slavic countries (as well as some Roma communities in Eastern Europe) to put a glass of vodka with a slice of bread (usually black bread) on top on graves or near photos of the deceased in their memory. This is similar to what people in Western countries do with flowers."
Sexual reproduction
Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.
"In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process."

Khumalo was promoted to the senior team by coach Ted Dumitru the following year, when he started a game against arch rivals Orlando Pirates."
Club career.
"Khumalo went on to become a star player for Kaizer Chiefs and did not play for any other South African soccer club, only leaving them for short overseas playing periods – he signed with FIFA agent Marcelo Houseman who first took him to Argentinian club Ferro Carril Oeste for six months in 1995, while in 1996 and 1997 he played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer."
"The high-point of Khumalo's soccer career was the 1990s; he was part of the Kaizer Chiefs teams that won three South African league championship titles and five knockout trophies and he was also voted South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. During his career at the club, he played in a total of 397 league and cup games, scoring 75 goals."
International career.
"After the re-admission of South Africa to FIFA in 1992, Khumalo was selected to be a member of the South African squad for its first official international match in July of the same year, against Cameroon. South Africa won the match 1–0, due to a penalty scored by Khumalo. He was also a leading member of the winning South African national team at the 1996 African Cup of Nations . He also represented South Africa in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Throughout his whole international career, he played for South Africa 50 times (twice as captain), scoring nine goals making him the 13th most capped South African footballer. Khumalo turned down a chance to play for the 1998 and 2000 African Cup of Nations. He made his international farewell in 2001."
"One of Doctor Khumalo's most memorable games was perhaps the 1996 Mandela Cup match, where South Africa played against Brazil. Phil Masinga scored the first goal from Doctor Khumalo's corner kick. Khumalo then scored the second goal to make the score 2–0 in favour of the South Africans. Unfortunately for Bafana, Brazil came back in the second half, scoring three goals, to win the encounter 3–2."

"He retired in 2002 and then in 2004 as a player-coach. Although he was a winning co-coach (with Donald ""Ace"" Khuse) of Kaizer Chiefs in the 2002–2003 season (guiding the club to a 12-game unbeaten record and earning themselves a joint Coach of the Month PSL award), Khumalo has stated that his aim is to become a soccer administrator. Since 2004, Khumalo served as a television soccer commentator and presenter, being named afterwards South African Under-17 national coach."

Mandalay in writing.
There are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.
"Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called ""Mandalay."" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: ""on the road to Mandalay."""
"In 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song ""On the Road to Mandalay."" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it ""Come Fly with Me""."
"George Orwell wrote a novel called ""Burmese Days"". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are ""A Hanging"" (1931) and ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936)."
Twin towns.
Mandalay has three twin towns:
Act of Congress
"An Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a ""Congress,"" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days."
Bills.
"Senators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated."
"A bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered ""dead"". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures."
Resolutions.
"In addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions."
Simple resolutions.
"These are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated ""H.Res."" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated ""S. Res."" followed by a number."
Joint resolutions.
"A joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated ""H.J.Res."" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated ""S.J.Res."", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills."
Concurrent resolutions.
"Concurrent resolutions start with either ""S.Con.Res."" (Senate) or ""H.Con.Res."" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law."
Jeff Weaver (political staffer)
"Jeffrey ""Jeff"" P. Weaver (born 1966) is an American political adviser. He was the campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver served as the campaign manager during Bernie Sanders' successful Senate run in 2006. Weaver also served as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices."
"Weaver was born in St. Albans, Vermont. He studied at Boston University, the University of Vermont, and Georgetown University."
Asta Nielsen
"Asta Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent movie actress. She was very popular in the 1910s. She was one of the first international movie stars. Nielsen was in 74 movies. 70 were in Germany where she was known simply as ""Die Asta"" (""The Asta""). She had large dark eyes, a face like a mask and a figure like a boy. Nielsen most often played strong and passionate women trapped by tragic lives. Her performances were erotic so Nielsen's movies were heavily censored in the United States. Therefore, she was not very famous there. Nielsen started her own movie studio in Berlin in the 1920s. She went back to Denmark in 1937 after Nazism became a problem. Later in life, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author."
F. Lee Bailey
"Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (June 10, 1933 – June 3, 2021) was an American criminal-defense lawyer. Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He worked in Massachusetts and Florida."
"The construction of this cultural hall began in 1903. The chief builder was J. Kreml from Litomysl. The foundation stone was laid on April 4, 1903. Smetana’s house is named after a famous composer Bedřich Smetana. He was born in Litomyšl in 1824. Smetana’s house is a theater and a cultural centre. Smetana’s house consists of a big auditorium, a small auditorium and a lounge. Its style is the Art Nouveau. You can visit concerts, balls and theatre performances there."
Regional Museum.
"The building of the museum was originally the piaristic grammar school. Alois Jirásek taught there. It is situated next to the Piaristic Church and opposite the castle. There was a big reconstruction of the building from 2012 to 2014. Today you can visit a new interactive display show of the history of the town, smaller displays of the Cabinet ancient history or Guild of shooters to target. Other contemporary exhibitions often take place there."
Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral college, as if it were a state. The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961."
"According to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors. Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election."
Background.
"When the Constitution was ratified, the nation's capital was New York City. However, Article one, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution states:"
"Selecting the site for the new capital was a political compromise. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury and bankers, mainly from the northeast, got the Bank of the United States located in Philadelphia. In exchange, a special District of Columbia would be located on the Potomac River, closer to the southern states and controlled by Congress."
"Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790 on a site selected by George Washington. He appointed three commissioners to prepare the city for the new government, scheduled for 1800. While this was taking place, from 1790 until 1800, the capital was Philadelphia."
"In 1800, as planned, the District of Columbia became the nation's capital. At the time the population was only about 5,000 residents. As a district and federal territory, the population did not have a local or state government. They also could not vote in federal elections."
"Passed by Congress on June 17, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961, Amendment XXIII, for the purposes of the Electoral College, treats the District of Columbia the same as if it were a state. This gives the citizens of the District the right to vote in presidential elections. The Amendment does not make the district a state, it gives the residents the same number of electors the same number as if it were a state. But, per the amendment, no more than the smallest state. The Amendment does not give district citizens any representation in Congress. Congress continues to govern the district."
Political impact.
"While the District of Columbia is considered politically neutral at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party since. African-Americans have voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the 1970 census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump. As a result, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964. However, the District's electoral votes have yet to prove decisive in a presidential election. The smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment's ratification was the 56 vote majority achieved by Jimmy Carter in 1976."
Paul Daniels
"Newton Edward Daniels (6 April 1938 – 17 March 2016), known by his stage name Paul Daniels, was an English magician and television performer."
"He was known for his show ""The Paul Daniels Magic Show"". It ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994. He was known for his catchphrase of ""You'll like this ... not a lot, but you'll like it"". He also hosted three game shows on the BBC, Odd One Out from 1982 to 1985, Every Second Counts from 1986 to 1993 and Wipeout from 1994 to 1997."
"He was born in South Bank, Middlesbrough. He married Jacqueline Skipworth in 1960. The couple had three sons: Gary, Paul and Martin. Daniels was married to his assistant Debbie McGee from 1988 until his death."
"Daniels died of a brain tumor in Wargrave, Berkshire, aged 77."

Notes
The Ugly Duckling
"""The Ugly Duckling"" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Andersen lavished great care on this story, spending a year perfecting it. It was first published in 1844 with ""The Angel"", ""The Sweethearts"", and ""The Nightingale"" in ""New Fairy Tales"". The critics liked these stories. Andersen considered the story ""a reflection of my own life."" The moral of the tale: ""it does not matter if you were born in a duck yard if you have lain in a swan's egg."" The tale has been adapted to various media such as animated movies."
Story.
"A mother duck hatches six pretty little ducklings. A seventh bird is hatched. He is homely. The other ducks abuse him. He runs away. He is given a home by an old woman. Her cat and hen do not like him. He runs away again. Winter comes and a kind farmer gives him a home. The little bird almost dies. Spring comes. The ""ugly duckling"" has grown into a beautiful swan. The other swans welcome him as their own. They bow to him. He is happy for the first time in his life."
General relativity
"General relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is matter, energy, and momentum resulting in what we perceive as gravity. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations. In general relativity, gravity has no force as Newton put forward. According to Einstein it is a curvature that warps not only space, but also time. (Time dilation)"
Idea.
"A central idea in general relativity is the ""principle of equivalence."" An example is that two people, one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth, and the other in an elevator in outer space but accelerating upwards at the speed of 9.8 m/s2 (every second the object picks up speed of 9.8 m/s), will each observe the same behavior of an object they drop from their hands. The object will accelerate to the floor at 9.8 m/s2 in either case, making it impossible for either to distinguish whether or not they are at rest in a gravitational field or accelerating upward creating the same effect as gravity would on Earth. Other versions of this type of ""thought experiment"" were used to show that light would curve in an accelerating frame of reference (perspective). There are several forms of the equivalence principle. These include: Newton's equivalence principle, the weak equivalence principle, the gravitational weak equivalence principle, Einstein's equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle."
"The Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime, and one of the other objects in the valley (i.e, spacetime) is the Earth. The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun (or ball) because it is moving too fast. The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force. This second force is called the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways. This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase. Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time, it stays at about the same distance. This is also how the Moon orbits the earth. In this second case, Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object. However, this valley example to demonstrate Gravity is insufficient because spacetime fabric is actually Four Dimensional, whereas valley's example implies two dimensional spacetime. Sun and other objects with mass curves four dimensional spacetime fabric. Valley example is just analogy and not 100% reality."
Predictions.
General relativity has predicted many things which were later seen. These include:
Rutland
"Rutland is the smallest county of England. It is surrounded by the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire."
The main towns of Rutland are Oakham and Uppingham.
"In the mid-1970s, it was the inspiration for Eric Idle's TV show, Rutland Weekend Television."
Adlai Stevenson I
"Adlai Ewing Stevenson (October 23, 1835 – June 14, 1914) was an American politician. He was vice president of the United States under Grover Cleveland, and ran for President and several other political offices, but lost. He was also first assistant Postmaster General and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois, as well. His grandson of the same name also was a notable politician and writer. Another grandson, McLean Stevenson was an actor. His other grandson was Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III."
"Toledo, Ohio"
"Toledo is a city in Ohio, USA. It was named after Toledo, Spain. It is a large industrial city, and has many factories that make things like car parts and glass. In 1835 and 1836, Ohio and Michigan both claimed to own the city and surrounding territory. Michigan gave up its claim and got the Upper Peninsula in exchange. Toledo is about an hour from Detroit, Michigan. The main highways in and out of Toledo are Interstate 75, Interstate 90, and U.S. 24 (Detroit Boulevard, Telegraph Road). It is the 59th largest city in the United States."
Toledo's manufacturing industry concentrates on automobiles and glass.
"Toledo has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
Similar movies.
"""The Magnificent Seven"" was an American movie Western with a similar story. This is called a remake."
"The movie was also adapted into an Japanese anime series in 2004 by GONZO, entitled Samurai 7. The anime series takes a more futuristic and fantasy take at the original story, replacing robots for thieves and bestowing superhuman abilities to the 7 samurais."
Vacuum tube
"A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating."
History.
"Although the vacuum tube was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904, it was Thomas Edison who discovered the ""Edison effect"" in 1883 which states that electricity does not necessarily need a solid material to move through; it can move through gas or vacuums as well."
"John Ambrose Fleming invented the first vacuum tube, the diode, in 1904. Lee De Forest invented the ""audion"" in 1906 (which was improved by others as the triode in 1908) and used in the first telephone amplifiers. Many other kinds were invented for various purposes."
"The transistor became cheaper in the 1960s and was much smaller, worked on lower voltages, and used less power. In addition, unlike vacuum tubes, they were much less likely to be damaged by being dropped and had extremely long life. Eventually, they were also much cheaper than glass vacuum tubes. At this time, most radios, television sets, and amplifiers began using transistors instead. High powered electronics such as broadcasting transmitters were transistorized more slowly. Television receivers continued using the cathode ray tube until the mid-2000s."
Current uses.
"In the 21st century, vacuum tubes are rarely used in common electronic equipment. Many devices today rely on the transistor over the vacuum tube. Some devices that still use the vacuum tube, however, include:"
Tupac Shakur
"Tupac Amaru Shakur (June 16, 1971 - September 13, 1996) was an American rapper and sometimes actor, also known as 2Pac and Makaveli, who sold many records.

His family was struggling with poverty. They moved homes often, sometimes they even had to stay in shelters."
"Tupac was involved in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died six days later from respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest due to his gunshot injuries he sustained. Since Shakur's death, seven more albums have been released. They have all been certified platinum."
Shakur acted in eight movies.
"He holds the Guinness World Record for the highest selling rap/hip hop artist, selling 165 million worldwide and 43 million in the US alone. Shakur was convicted of assault and sexual assault in separate incidents."
His work of music had very big influences on the Hip-hop/rap industry in the US.
"In 2014, a biographical movie about Tupac was announced. The movie, titled ""All Eyez on Me"", was released on June 16, 2017."
Early life.
"He was born as Lesane Crooks in East Harlem, New York. Crooks was later renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur after Túpac Amaru II, a ruler in Peru. His family later moved to Marin City, California, when Tupac was 17. Tupac went to Baltimore school for Arts, where he found it interesting to read Shakespeare's poems. He got very affected by the beauty of rhyming, choosing the word and expression. He studied poetry, acting, jazz, and ballet."
Music career.
"In 1990, Shakur joined with the Oakland, California-based alternative hip hop group Digital Underground. He appeared on two of the group's albums in 1991, ""This Is an EP Release"" and ""Sons of the P"". Later that year he produced and released his first solo album, 2Pacalypse Now. The album gained him national attention and featured protest content including racism."
"His second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. was released in 1993. It contained the hit singles ""I Get Around"" and ""Keep Ya Head Up."""
"His third album, Me Against the World was released in 1995. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. He was incarcerated (in prison) at the time."
"His fourth album, All Eyez on Me (1996), was the last album released during his lifetime. All Eyez on Me included the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles ""How Do U Want It?"" and ""California Love."""
Shakur won the Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap Album in 1996 for ‘Me Against the World’. He received the American Music Award for the Favorite Rap/Hip Hop artist posthumously in 1997.
Several of Shakur's albums were released posthumously. It contained previously recorded material from when he was alive.
Assassination.
"On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting by someone in a Cadillac car at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died six days later at the Southern Nevada University Medical Center. His murder is still unsolved."

The Last of Us
The Last of Us is a third person survival horror action-adventure video game made by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It released for the PlayStation 3 on 14th June 2013 and a version of the game with updated graphics called was released for the PlayStation 4 on 29th July 2014. This version also has a downloadable content called Left Behind. The story is about two people named Joel and Ellie trying to survive different dangers.
Story.
"The Last of Us takes place twenty years in an alternate future where a deadly fungus outbreak has occurred in the United States, spreading throughout earth, creating zombie like creatures from the corpses of the dead. The story focuses on Joel and Ellie, two survivors that have escaped the soldier patrolled quarantine zones, in hopes to find the cure to the disease that Ellie may be the beginning of. Throughout their trip, they encounter a variety of different people that sometimes help them, and other times try to hurt them."
"Joel lives with Sarah (his 12 years old daughter) in America. One night, sounds of explosions broke the silence. It seems that a kind of mushroom sick goes to the human body and changes their genetics and make them to ""Wild people eater"". Joel, his brother Tommy, and Sarah want to escape from the city but the city was surrounded by Armed Soldiers and in the middle of the way, Sarah is shot by one of the soldiers and dies in her father's arms."
"20 years later, when many people have died by this disease, the survivors live in a quarantine area. Joel, with his friend Tess, do smuggle in that area but a person named Robert has stolen their weapons."
"After the fights that they do with Robert, Robert tells them that he has gave the weapons to a group called Fireflies. Marlin is the head of this group and promises to Joel and Tess that he will give back their weapons if they give a girl called Ellie to the Fireflies."
Reception.
"The game got great reception, getting over 120 awards and receiving the title of 2013's game of the year. IGN rated the game 10 out of 10, along with many other national game raters, that all rated the game highest any game has ever received. During the first week, the game sold over 3.4 million copies, second only to Grand Theft Auto in sales records ."
"The Last of Us is the most awarded game of all time, winning over 200 game of the year awards.This game has applauded by the critics and took over than 50 complete numbers and the average of the numbers is 95 from 100."
Game Play.
"The Last of Us is a third-person perspective game. The first characters of the game are Joel and Ellie. For most of the game, players control Joel, and Ellie is controlled by the game's Artificial Intelligence. Players also control Ellie and Sarah in a few parts of the game. In this game you can use different guns and other things which you find in the environment like knifes to kill your enemies."
Multiplayer.
"The game includes a multiplayer side, where the player can choose to be a Hunter or a Firefly, with the objective of completing twelve weeks (84 days/games) on each side. It comes with multiple different modes and maps."
Mugello is a landscape in northern Italy. Mugello is north of Florence. The Santerno River's valley is nearby. The two valleys are separated by the Futa Pass (a path or way to cross over the mountain between those two valleys).
"In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (also called the Magelli tribe), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left very few signs behind because the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to many castles. Later on, Mugello was taken over by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built villas (large houses) there. They were similar to ones built by the Medici royal family."
Friar
"Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life, rather than living like ascets in a monastery."
Orders.
"There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four ""great orders"" and the so-called ""lesser orders""."
Four great orders.
"The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and are:"
Lesser orders.
The lesser orders are:
Carmelites
"The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel; ) is a Roman Catholic religious order. It was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel, from which the order receives its name. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. The order of Carmelite nuns was made official in 1452."
Samael
"Samael () (also Sammael and Şamil) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic beliefs and stories, as well as Christian tradition and demonology. There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome."
"Samael is often accorded with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven."
Powers.
"The website Catholic.org says Samael is a ""Power"", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels."
"Powers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness."
In Judaism and Christianity.
"In Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. ""Yalkut I, 110"" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In ""Sotah 10b"", Samael is Esau's guardian angel."
"In the ""Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer"", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent."
"Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son."
"According to ""The Ascension of Moses"" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:"
"""In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, ""Anger,"" and Hemah, ""Wrath,"" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, ""Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,"" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. ""This one,"" said Metatron, addressing Moses, ""is Samael, who takes the soul away from man."" ""Whither goes he now?"" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, ""To fetch the soul of Job the pious."" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, ""O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel."""
"In ""The Holy Kabbalah"" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the ""severity of God"", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution."
"Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means ""He who sees God""."
Popular culture.
Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana.
"In the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat."
"Modern Turkey's varied climate lets many kinds of food crops grow, and livestock and forestry are important industries. Turkey makes enough food to feed itself. Turkish manufactures include aeroplanes, electronics, cars, clothing and textiles for home and for other countries."
"Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beaches on its Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, and many important historical places."
History.
Ancient Anatolia.
"The first major empire in the area was the Hittites (from the 18th century to the 13th century BCE). The Hittites, who spoke one of the Indo-European languages, developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the Sea People in the 11th century BCE and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia."
"From 1950 BCE, Armenians and Assyrians inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BCE). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until their empire was conquered by Babylonia in 612 BCE. Then Anatolia became home for various kingdoms including the Achaemenid Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), Seljuk Empire, and Mongol Empire."
The Ottoman Empire.
"During the 14th century, after the fall of the Mongol Empire, Gazi Osman built a new empire named after himself: the Ottoman Empire. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the Balkans, (Yugoslavia and Bulgaria) in Europe. The Empire was ruled by Islamic law, but other religions had certain minority rights."
"In World War I the Ottoman Empire was one of the Central Powers. During the war, 500,000 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called Armenian genocide. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that Atatürk led the newly formed Turkish army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks and ousted the imperial Ottoman family from Anatolia."
Republic of Türkiye.
"Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the first President of Turkey. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatürk felt that he weakened Islam in the country. Later political disputes led to Coup d'état in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts."
"In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and later established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş became the first Turkish Cypriot president."
"On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted."
"In 2022, the government of Turkey started to use the Turkish spelling of Türkiye in both Turkish and English. However, Turkey remains the more common name."
People.
About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are ethnic Turks. About 15% are ethnic Kurds. Many refugees from Syria (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the Syrian civil war. Many Romani live in Istanbul and Edirne (European part of Turkey).
The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. Much of the population in Turkey is made up of young adults and adults.
"According to religiosity poll conducted in Turkey in 2019 by OPTİMAR, 89.5% of the population identifies as Muslim, 4.5% believed in God but did not belong to an organized religion, 2.7% were agnostic, 1.7% were atheist, 0.5% were belonged to the other religions, and 1.1% did not answer. Another poll conducted by Gezici Araştırma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and found that 28.5% of the Generation Z in Turkey identify as irreligious."
"Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as mantı (Turkish ravioli), döner, kebap, Turkish delight (lokum), baklava, lahmacun, börek, köfte, and other foods."
"According to a study, Anatolia is genetically more closely related to the Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of Anatolia (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from Central Asia."
Majority and minorities.
"Most people in Turkey are Turks. The largest minority is Kurds. Kurds live mostly in Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are the Romani, mostly live in East Thrace, the European side of Turkey."
Economy.
Turkey is in the OECD and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.
"In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey."
"Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's international trade is mostly with the EU, the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey."
Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion United States dollars.
"Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no petroleum and not much natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"Rich cities in Turkey include Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Edirne, Konya, Mersin (also known as İçel), and Antalya."
Culture.
Language.
"Most people in Turkey speak Turkish. It is written in Latin script and it belongs to the Turkic language group, which also includes many other languages spoken across Asia, such as Azerbaijani and Tatar. The Turkish language came from Central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in Central Asia. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents."
John Shaft
John Shaft is a fictional character. He is played by Richard Roundtree in the 1971 movie that goes by his last name. He was also in the movie's four sequels. Samuel L. Jackson plays John Shaft II in the 2000 remake of Shaft and the 2019 sequel.
There was also a television series in 1973-74 on CBS.
"In February 2015, the New Line Cinema got the rights to the reboot of ""Shaft"". The movie is titled ""Son of Shaft"". It will be released in June 2019."
2018 Little Village fire
"On August 26, 2018, a fire broke out in Chicago's Mexican-American Little Village neighborhood. The fire killed 10 children, including six under the age of 12. Investigators stated that the fire started in the back of the building in a ground-floor apartment, which was vacant."
"The fire is the deadliest residential fire to have occurred in Chicago since 1958. In the aftermath of the fire, multiple violations were found in the apartment. Apartment owner, Merced Gutierrez, appearing in court for the 40 violations found at the site of the fire."
Jun-ichi Nishizawa
"was a Japanese engineer and inventor. He was known for his electronic inventions beginning in the 1950s, including the PIN diode, static induction transistor, and static induction thyristor. He was a professor at Sophia University. Many called him the ""Father of Japanese Microelectronics""."
"Nishizawa died on October 21, 2018 in Sendai, Japan at the age of 92."

The Australian men's para ice hockey team (also known as Aussie Ice Roos) is the ice sledge hockey team representing Australia. The team will make it's debut at the 2018 World Para Ice Hockey Championships in Pool C in Finland.
Statue of Unity
"The Statue of Unity is a tribute to the Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, unveiled on 31 October 2018. This statue is a patriotic symbol of the legacy of a man who spent his life in the struggle for freedom. As a mark of respect the government built the statue of sardar vallabhbhai naming it a statue of unity.this statue is located at his birthplace in Gujarat. The statue is designed by Ram V. Sutar. The total amount for the project is US $430 million. The statue stands 182 metres high, making it one of the tallest monuments in the world, second to the St. Louis Arch."
"The Statue of Unity is at Sadhu Bet Island. A 12 km square lake will create the atmosphere of equality and diversity. A special trust called as “Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust” has been created for to manage the place. The statue is made with steel frame and reinforced concrete. For durability, the statue has been given bronze plating. The statue has a 153 m high viewing deck able to hold 200 visitors. It has a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar Dam."
"It has been designed to withstand winds of velocity of 60 metres/second, and is also claimed to be earthquake resistant. A total of 22,500 tons of cement forms the core structure of this monument. The iron used in the construction was collected from old farm equipment throughout India. A team of 700 Indian workers worked on the cementing and casting."
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (31 October 1875 — 15 December 1950) was a lawyer and influential political leader in the Indian independence movement. After independence, he played an important role in the integration of over 500 princely states into the Indian Union. He was deeply influenced by Gandhi’s ideology and principles, having worked very closely with the leader. Despite being the choice of the people, on the request of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel stepped down from the candidacy of Congress President, which ultimately turned out to be the election to choose the first Prime Minister of independent India. He was the first Home Minister of Independent India and his uncompromising efforts towards consolidation of the country earned him the title ""Iron Man of India""."
Childhood.
"Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Zaverbai and Ladbai. He belongs to rich class agriculturist Patidar (leva patidar patel) community and Vallabhbhai’s father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi, and his mother was a very spiritual woman."
"Starting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British."
"In 1891, he married Zaverbai and the couple had two children. His daughter, Maniben Patel (1903-1990), was an activist while his son, Dahyabhai Patel (1905-1973) was a member of the parliament of India."
Patel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s words deeply affected Vallabhbhai and he soon adopted Gandhi’s principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader. That is how deeply Gandhi’s words had affected him. He didn’t know that he would change India and start a successful career.
"Lao has mainly native Lao words. Because of Buddhism, however, it has been influenced by other languages that contributed mostly religious terms. Lao has influenced Khmer and Thai and . The writing has many foreign loanwords, very similar to how Latin and Greek have influenced other European languages."
"For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, as well as ending statements with ແດ່ (dè ) or ເດີ້ (deu ). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with ດອກ (dok ). The following are formal register examples."
Sukiyaki
"Sukiyaki is a very popular one-pot meal in Japan. The main ingredient (or stuff) is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word ""yaki"" means ""sautee"" or ""grill"" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet."
History.
"In Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This custom was publicly decided by the then emperor on April 1, 675. But it is said that the real intention of this custom was to raise cultivation of rice product. This is a commandment (or rule) of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly."
"The first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment."
Preparation.
"Each Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between ""Kansai"" (western Japan) and ""Kanto"" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on ""Gyunabe"" that was in fashion in ""Meiji"" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, ""sake"" and ""mirin"") together. They then stew beef in it."
"In the ""Kansai"" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the"" Kansai"" style of cooking sukiyaki."
"The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear."
Poplar DLR station
"Poplar DLR station serves Poplar, London. It is a station on the Docklands Light Railway in Travelcard Zone 2. It is a served by four of the five routes of the DLR. Thus it is the busiest station on the network in terms of services."
Shawm
"The shawm was a musical instrument of the woodwind family that was played in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The modern oboe was developed from the shawm. Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double reed. It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a trumpet). It sounded very loud, and was mostly used outdoors."
"In German the shawm is called ""Schalmei"" or ""Pommer"". The first word may have come from the Latin word ""calamus"" meaning ""reed or stalk"". There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names. There were also several different sizes."
Westferry DLR station
"Westferry DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), in the Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. To the west is Limehouse station, whilst to the east the DLR splits, with one branch going to Poplar station and the other to West India Quay station"
"The DLR station was built midway between the site of the old Limehouse and West India Docks stations on the disused London and Blackwall Railway. Limehouse Police Station is nearby, as is St Anne's Church, built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and boasting London's tallest church clock tower."
Limehouse station
"Limehouse station is a railway station in Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is served by Docklands Light Railway (DLR) services and by National Rail services. The National Rail services are operated by c2c out of Fenchurch Street station. On the c2c route, Limehouse is between Fenchurch Street and West Ham stations. On the Docklands Light Railway, Limehouse is between Shadwell and Westferry stations."
History.
"The station was opened on 3 August 1840 as part of the London and Blackwall Railway. The area used to be known as Ratcliffe, whilst the station has been previously known as Stepney, Stepney Junction and later Stepney East station. Another station some distance to the east on the London and Blackwall Railway, open between 1840 and 1926, had previously been called Limehouse."
Limehouse station today.
"The current Limehouse station is to the west of Limehouse Basin, a marina and residential complex, and the Regent's Canal. Nearby is the north end of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, and the western end of the Limehouse Link tunnel. The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation."
"According to train operators c2c, ""Limehouse is a bustling commuter station in the rush hour with passengers changing onto the Docklands Light Railway. At quieter times of day, it's an ideal stop-off point for Limehouse Basin and Thames-side walks through London's Docklands""."

Types of retaining wall are:
Main type of walls.
"Load Bearing Wall is a structural element. It carries the weight of a house from the roof and upper floors, all the way to the foundation. It supports structural members like beams, slab and walls on above floors."
Non-Load Bearing Wall doesn't help the structure to stand up and holds up only itself. It doesn't support floor roof loads above. It is a framed structure. Most are interior walls whose purpose is to divide the structure into rooms.
"Partition Wall separates spaces from buildings. It can be solid, constructed from brick or stone. It is a framed construction. The partition wall is secured to the floor, ceiling, and walls. It is enough strong to carry its own load. It resists impact. It is stable and strong to support wall fixtures. The partition wall works as a sound barrier and it is fire resistant."
"Cavity Wall A cavity wall or hollow wall consists of two separate walls, called leaves or skins, with a cavity or gap in-between. The two leaves of the cavity wall may be of equal thickness if it a non-load-bearing wall or the internal leaf may be thicker than the external leaf, to meet the structural requirements."
Veneered Wall holds up the material. It can be made of brick or stone. The most famous veneered wall is made of brick. The wall is only one wythe thick. It became the norm when building codes began to require insulation in interior walls. It is light weighted. Veneered walls can be built quickly.
Coordinated Universal Time
"Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the standard time system of the world. It is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude."
"The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people."
"Some websites, for example Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the Internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world)."
"Time zones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC−5 (United States east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in New York (UTC−5) and 10:00 in Moscow (UTC+3)."
07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).
"Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock. That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'. For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600. UTC also does not use daylight savings time - that way the time stays consistent the entire year."

Television
"A television set (also known as a television receiver or televisor or simply a television, TV set, TV receiver or TV) is a machine with a screen or set of lenses. Televisions receive broadcasting signals and change them into pictures and sound. The word ""television"" comes from the words tele (Greek for ""far away"") and vision (""sight"")."
Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
A TV can show pictures from many television networks. Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs.
"The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread."
"At first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor."
"All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1950s these were usually ""black and white"", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors. Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners. That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen."
"Today flat panel displays are the usual kind. These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges. This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape."
The early 21st century is also when digital television transmission became more common than analog television.
Sociology
"Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups. Sociology is a social science. People who study sociology are called sociologists. A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations."
"Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780 was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology. Auguste Comte, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena. Themes included: community, authority, status, alienation and lack of power."
"In the 2000s, some sociologists look at such things as: race, ethnicity, class, gender, the family and social interaction. They also study the breakdown of social structures; crime and divorce."

"Uozu, Toyama"
"is a city in Toyama Prefecture, Japan."
History.
Uozu developed as a castle town.
"In 1582, the forces of Oda Nobunaga forced the Uesugi clan to give up control of Uozu Castle."
"In 1918, riots started in Uozo because of increases in rice prices."
"In 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu."
Geography.
"Several rivers run through Uozu—the Fuse River, the Katakai River, the Kado River, and the Hayatsuki River."
Gold was discovered in the mountains of near Uozu.
Demography.
"According to Japanese census data,"
Lake Mungo remains
"The Lake Mungo remains are three sets of human fossils. They are Lake Mungo 1 (""LM1"", or ""Mungo Lady""), Lake Mungo 2 (""LM2""), and Lake Mungo 3 (""LM3"", or ""Mungo Man""). The sites are located near Lake Mungo, in New South Wales, Australia, in the World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes Region. Pieces of skeletons have been found in this region. These pieces have been attributed to over forty human skeletons. The Lake Mungo remains are the most significant of these."
Mungo Lady (LM1).
"LM1 are the fossilised, cremated remains of a young woman. They were found in 1969 by James Bowler with the University of Melbourne. Radiocarbon dating of pieces of bone from the burial put LM1 between 24,700 and 19,030 years old. Charcoal from a hearth 15 cm above the burial was dated at 26,250 years old (plus or minus 1,120 years). Reconstruction and study of the remains were mainly done by Alan Thorne at the Australian National University. The patterns of burn marks on the bones suggest that the body was first burned, then smashed, then burned a second time, before being buried."
"Research published by Bowler in 2003 rejected previous estimates for all of remains at the site. Optical dating concluded that both LM1 and LM3 were buried around 40,000 years ago (plus or minus 2,000 years). This makes it the earliest evidence of human cremation that has been found. It suggests that ancient indigenous Australians in this region had their own complicated burial rituals."
"The bones were returned in 1992 to the area's traditional owners: the Paakantji (Barkindji), the Mathi Mathi and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park visitor centre."
Mungo Man (LM3).
"LM3 was found by James Bowler on 26 February 1974, when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. It is located 500 m east of the LM1 site. The body was covered with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a complicated and artistic burial practice. Like the cremation of LM1, this indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought."
Description.
"The skeleton was of a slender individual, quite different to the build of modern indigenous Australians. The skeleton was badly preserved: large pieces of the skull were missing, and most of the bones in the limbs were damaged. Usually, the gender of a skeleton is determined using the bones in the skull and the pelvis. The problem is that these bones are in a very bad state in LM3, or they are missing altogether; in other words, the ""normal"" method of gender determination cannot be used with LM3. Since LM3 was discovered, other features were studied; most of these studies agree that LM3 was probably a male."
"LM3 was buried lying on his back, with his hands joined together covering the groin. Some of the bones show evidence of osteoarthritis and eburnation, and the teeth are well worn. Based on this, it is likely that LM3 was quite old (around 50 years old) when he died. New studies show that, using the length of his limb bones, it is possible to estimate LM3's height at 196 centimetres (77 inches or 6 ft 5 in), unusually tall for an Aboriginal."
Age.
"The first estimate of LM3's age was made in 1976 by the team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) who excavated LM3. They estimated that LM3 was between 28,000 and 32,000 years old. They did not test LM3's remains directly; instead, they made their estimate through stratigraphic comparison with LM1. In 1987, an electron spin resonance test was done on pieces of bone from LM3's skeleton. This gave an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999, optical dating work was done on quartz from the LM3 burial site. The results indicated a burial older than 24,600 years (± 2,400) and younger than 43,300 years (± 3,800)."
"Later in the same year, research led by Alan Thorne gave a new estimate of 62,000 years old (plus or minus 6,000 years). This estimate was made by combining data from uranium-thorium dating, electron spin resonance dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the remains and the soil in the grave. This estimate was very controversial, and some of the techniques used to get this estimate were criticised."
"In 2003, several Australian groups came to an agreement that LM3 is about 40,000 years old. A team led by Bowler did 25 more OSL tests that suggested that LM3 can not be older than 50,000 years. This age roughly agrees with stratigraphic evidence using four different dating methods. The age of 40,000 years is now the most widely accepted age for the LM3. This makes it the second oldest human fossil east of India, and the oldest in Australia. In addition to this, the study published in 2003 found that LM1 and LM3 are similar in age, and that humans were present at Lake Mungo as early as 50,000 to 46,000 years ago."
Other discoveries of remains.
"In 1998, the remains of a child were discovered. These are believed to have roughly the same age as Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. In 2005, erosion exposed another adult skeleton. Because it was not protected, this skeleton was destroyed by wind and rain about a year later."
Individual identity.
"A lifestyle is a way of living or doing things. Lifestyle is doing things, living your life and making decisions in your own unique way. Lifestyle can be political, social, economical and personal way of seeing, doing and understanding things. Not all parts of a lifestyle are our decisions. Surrounding social and technical systems, like economical situation and people around us, can limit the lifestyle choices available to the individual."

"Barbara Bates (August 6, 1925 – March 18, 1969) was an American actress. She acted mostly in movies. She played Phoebe in the 1950 movie ""All about Eve"" and acted in many other movies in her career. She was born in Denver, Colorado. She killed herself with carbon monoxide poisoning, also in Denver. She was age 43."
Seven Bridges of Königsberg
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically famous problem in mathematics. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735. This led to the beginning of graph theory. This then led to the development of topology.
"The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River. It included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges."
The problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges. Every bridge must have been crossed completely every time. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Euler proved that the problem has no solution.
Euler's analysis.
"First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter. The only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed. So, he changed the problem to abstract terms. This laid the foundations of graph theory. He removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In the language of graph theory, he replaced each land mass with an abstract ""vertex"" or node. Then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection, an ""edge"". An edge (road) recorded which two vertices (land masses) were connected. In this way, he formed a graph."
→
"The graph drawn is an abstract picture of the problem. So, the edges can be joined in any way. Only whether two points are connected or not are important. Changing the picture of the graph does not change the graph itself."
"Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In any walk of the graph, the number of times one enters a vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. If every bridge has been crossed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ""even"". This is because if there are n bridges, it is crossed exactly 2n times. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ""odd"" number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three are touched by 3). There are at most two masses which can be the endpoints of a walk. So the proposition of a walk crossing each bridge once leads to a contradiction."
"In modern language, Euler shows that whether a walk through a graph crossing each edge once is possible or not depends on the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler shows that a necessary condition for the walk is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This result stated by Euler was later proved by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an ""Eulerian path"" or ""Euler walk"". If there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph representing the historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path."
"Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735. It was published as ""Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis"" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ""Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae"" in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics."
Importance in the history of mathematics.
"In the history of mathematics, Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics."
Present state of the bridges.
"Two of the seven original bridges were destroyed during the bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Two others were later demolished. They were replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935). Thus, as of 2000, there were five bridges in Kaliningrad."
"In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but since it must begin on one island and end on the other, it is impractical for tourists."
The Heat
The Heat is a 2013 police comedy which stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. Bullock plays a Special Agent and the latter plays a detective. This comedy is set in Boston.
San (river)
San is a river in southeastern Poland. It is 443.3 km long.
"Sir John Shakespeare II (c. 1530-September 1601) was an English nobleman, politician, and knight. He was Sir William Shakespeare's father and husband of Mary Arden."
"Sir John Shakespeare II was the son of English nobleman Sir Richard Shakespeare I (1490-1561) and Abigail Webb (1493-1565), John II was named after his paternal grandfather the English politician Sir John Shakespeare I (1460-1521), John II great-grandfather was the English politician Sir Thomas Shakespeare (1430-1511)."
Norwegian Elkhound
"The Norwegian Elkhound is a type of dog that was bred in Norway, where most of them are found. They are fluffy and are working dogs."
"They have been living and working with humans since the stone age and served as a hunter, herder, guard and companion."
"A spitz, type with curled tale and pricked ears, the are friendly,playful and also great with kids.They are a great family dog, but needs a large garden and daily walks. They enjoy an active family that will play with them but are more than happy to live a less strenuous life but,they must not be allowed to get lazy because as with all hounds, will put on weight in excess."
Kim Dae-jung
"Kim Dae-jung (January 6, 1924 – August 18, 2009) was a South Korean president. In 2000, he got the Nobel Peace Prize. He is the first person from Korea to get a Nobel prize. A Roman Catholic since 1957, he has been called the ""Nelson Mandela"" of Asia Kim Dae Jung was the President (succeeding Kim Young-sam) from 1998 to 2003. He was born in Haui-do, South Jeolla Province, an island off the South Korean Coast in 1924."
"Kim died on August 18, 2009 at a hospital in Seoul from cardiac arrest caused by multiple organ failure and pneumonia, aged 85."
Tagalog language
Tagalog is one of the main languages spoken in the Philippines and is the national language of the country. More than 22 million people speak it as their first language.
"It was originally spoken by the Tagalog people in the Philippines, who were mainly in Bulacan, Cavite, and some parts of Luzon. Now, Tagalog is spoken nationwide and used by Filipinos from different parts of the country to understand each other."
"It originally was used with an abugida, the Baybayin script, but the Latin alphabet is now used."
Basso continuo
"Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means ""continuous bass""."
"Basso continuo, sometimes just called ""continuo"", was played by an instrument providing chordal accompaniment such as a keyboard instrument or plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ, such as a small portative instrument."
It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player. The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and doubled on the other bass instrument. The composer would indicate what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.
Diwali
"Diwali (also: Deepawali) is one of India's biggest festivals. The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy. During this festival, people light up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay). They worship the Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom."
"This festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Kartikamasam which falls sometime during October or November. It is celebrated to mark the return of Lord Rama after 14 years of exile and his victory over the Demon Ravana. In many parts of India, Deepawali is celebrated for five consecutive days. Hindus regard it as a celebration of life and use the occasion to strengthen relationships. In some parts of India, it marks the beginning of a new year. People clean and decorate their house before the festival. They do colorful rangoli art works on floors."
"Deepawali is celebrated and is a public holiday in countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, Fiji, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago. It is also a school holiday in many states of the United States with a large Hindu population."
President George W. Bush had the first celebration of the holiday in the White House.
"Hindus light up their homes and shops to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi and to give them good luck for the year ahead. A few days before Ravtegh, which is the day before Deepavali, houses, buildings, shops and temples are thoroughly cleaned, whitewashed and decorated with pictures, toys and flowers. On the day of Deepawali, people put on their best clothes and exchange greetings, gifts and sweets with their friends and family."
"At night, buildings are illuminated with earthen lamps, candle-sticks and electric bulbs. Sweets and toy shop are decorated to attract the passers-by. The bazaars and streets are overcrowded. People buy sweets for their own families and also send them as presents to their friends and relatives. The Goddess Lakshmi is also worshiped in the form of earthen images, silver rupee. Hindus believe that on this day, Lakshmi only enters houses which are neat and tidy. People offer prayers for their own health, wealth and prosperity. They leave the light on in buildings believing that Lakshmi will not have difficulty in finding her way in."
Diwali is one of the most important festival of the Hindus.It is also known as deepawali or the festival of lights. It comes on Amavasya day in the month of kartik. Both rich and poor wear new clothes on this day. Lots of sweets are made. People light diyas and burn crackers. They ex- change greetings and sweets. Goddess Laxmi is worshipped on this day.
Arthashastra
Disease.
"For centuries, people around the world have used mass graves when many people died at once from epidemics of diseases. The goal of this type of mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately."
"For example, during outbreaks of the bubonic plague (""The Black Death"") in Europe, people were terrified of catching this disease from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave:"
"However, at some mass graves for plague victims, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions."
Disasters.
"More recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one."
"For example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no room, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one."
"One Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: ""You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial."" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. Like at the mass graves for the plague victims, they were still trying to honor the dead, even though they had to bury them in mass graves."
"Some areas in Japan also had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In Japan, most people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead."
Murder and genocide.
"Throughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for victims of disease or disasters, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered."
Mass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples.
World War I.
"During World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them."
World War II.
The Holocaust.
"During The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders:"
Soldiers' graves.
"During World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe."
"The Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad."
The Soviet Union.
"In the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves."
The biggest include:
The Korean War.
"Early on in the Korean War, South Korea killed at least 100,000 people who had been put in prison for their political beliefs. They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea."
The Vietnam War.
"During the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves."
Genocide in Cambodia.
"From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution."
Other wars.
"During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Bosnian Serb Army killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica genocide. They buried them in mass graves. In 2003, mass grave specialists found a mass grave that was ""as big as a tennis court."" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves."
"During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it."
Piano Duos.
"Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos. These are usually called piano duos. Examples include Mozart’s Sonata in D major K448. The Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms started as a string quintet but he changed it to a piano concerto, then a piano duo, and eventually a piano quintet. The Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff is another. Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists. Piano concertos can be played on two pianos, with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestra’s music."
Piano Six Hands.
"There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano. This is called Piano six hands. These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play, although there are examples of serious pieces. The three people need to be good friends, because it is a bit of a squash. The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it."
Piano six hands
"Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano, and from piano trio which is music for piano, violin and cello. Not much music has been written for this combination, although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces."
Examples.
"Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's op.17 and 741, Jean Cras's ""Âmes d’enfants"", Paul Robinson (composer)'s ""Pensees"" and ""Monmartre"", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs, Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's ""Metrorhythmia 1"", John Pitts's ""Are You Going?"", Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's ""Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich"", Canadian composer Paul Frehner's ""Slowdown"" and Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi's ""Promenade""."
Pedal
"A pedal is something that is made to work by someone's foot. The word ""pedal"" comes from the Latin word for ""foot"". Many things can be made to work by pedals. These include:"
Rice wine
"Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks. However, it is not a true wine, despite the name. True wine is made by fermenting grapes, and perhaps other fruit. In rice wine, the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar. This sugar is then fermented. This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer."
"The ""rice wines"" made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines (18–25% alcohol compared to 10–14% for normal wines). Beers on the other hand usually have 4–8% alcohol in them."
"Many people use the term ""rice wine"" to refer to sake (which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines)."
Alcopop
"Alcopops are alcoholic drinks. They are also known as Ready-to-drink (RTD), Flavored Alcoholic Beverage (FAB) or Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB). They are usually available in bottles or cans. They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer. Usually, they are very sweet, so that the alcohol can not be tasted."
"There are two different kinds of this drinks. In Europe, they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade, like vodka with lemon juice (and a lot of sugar, so the alcohol cannot be tasted), or rum with fruit juice (also very sweet). In the US, they tend to be beers, which taste very sweet."
"Because they are very sweet, alcopops tend to be more popular among young people. Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste, these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries. These have either raised the taxes on the drinks, or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age (usually 18, sometimes 21 years)."
Pedal (music)
"Pedals on musical instruments are used to control parts of the instrument, or provide extra notes."
There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons.
Piano.
"The piano has at least two pedals; large concert grand pianos always have three. The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed. It does this by lifting the dampers from the strings. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well (""in sympathy"")."
"The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the ""una corda"" pedal (Italian for ""one string""). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead. On an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard."
"On pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord which the player is holding down when the pedal is pressed will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected."
Organ.
On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.
"Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in danger, they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do."
"Grebes can have long or short bills. If they eat insects in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat crustaceans (for example, crabs) they will have a long, sharp bill."
"Most grebes are brown, white and red/orange. They have many, waterproof feathers. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In spring and summer, grebes have orange crests on their heads. This is so they can attract a mate. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they ""dance"" in the water."
Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults.
Habitat.
"Grebes live in freshwater (lakes or rivers). Some species of grebe will go to saltwater (sea/ocean) when they are migrating. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in North America, Europe or Asia. Grebes in South America, Africa and Asia do not migrate. They are found in every continent on earth."
Funeral director
"A Funeral Director also called a mortician or undertaker is a person who has the job of organizing a funeral. This often includes embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the planning and arrangement of the actual funeral ceremony. They place the body into a coffin or casket. If people are going to come and look at the body before burial, the funeral director will have the body dressed, and made up with cosmetics to make it look better."
Mangrove
"Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics. Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat, called a ""mangrove swamp"", ""mangrove forest"", ""mangrove"" or ""mangal"". Mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores. They are also found in sub-tropical Africa, Asia, and the southwest Pacific. Their twisted, tangled roots collect sediment. Over time, the sediment may become islands, or extend the shoreline."
Description.
"Mangroves live right in the sea, or at the sea edge. Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fall. If the water level is high, they may be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As soil and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed – just the right place for other island vegetation to grow. This is an example of seed dispersal by water."
"Mangroves have special root-like structures. They are aerial roots or ""pneumatophores"". These stick up out of the soil, and are covered in lenticels. They take in oxygen through their pores. These ""breathing tubes"" may reach heights of up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. Smaller roots with air passages move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater. For more information please visit a geography site https://www.kidsgeog.com THANK YOU Mangrove"
Benefits.
"Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral reefs which often surround them. They trap dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants. The tree also protects the shoreline (and, through this, the coral reefs) from being eroded by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish, shrimp, and crabs to grow."
BBC account.
"Mangroves are a group of about 80 different salt-tolerant species of trees. They can live along the intertidal zones of tropical and sub-tropical coastlines. Their roots stand the ebb and flow of tides. The roots slow the flow of the tidal waters. This lets sediment settle and build up as nutrient-rich mud. The habitat is a valuable shelter and breeding site for fish. It stabilises coastlines, and reduces erosion from storm surges and tsunamis."
Great crested grebe
"The great crested grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is ""Podiceps cristatus""."
Description.
The great crested grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46–51 cm long. Its wingspan (both wings open) is 59–73 cm long.
"The bird is white, brown and black, and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby great crested grebe have black and white stripes on their heads."
Habitat and behaviour.
"The great crested grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food."
"The bird has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a ""dance"" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking."
"The great crested grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water."
Conservation.
"The bird nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many great crested grebe in the United Kingdom, where their conservation status is ""green"" (""least concern"")."
Garry Kasparov
"Garry Kasparov (born 13 April 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian chess grandmaster and political activist. He was born with the name ""Garry Weinstein"", and is partly of Jewish descent. He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation (the PCA), because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and was the highest-rated player even after his retirement, It was till much later when Magnus Carlsen took him over."
"Kasparov became the youngest non-disputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when an argument with FIDE led him to set up a rival company, the Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kasparov lost a match (a series of chess games) against ""Deep Blue"", a computer made by IBM, in 1997. Lately, retired from competition, he has been coaching Magnus Carlsen, the young player from Norway who is the current world #1."
Politics.
"After retiring from chess, Kasparov became involved in Russian politics. In 2005, he traveled around Russia, speaking against Vladimir Putin, who was President of Russia at that time. The same year he created the United Civil Front, a political movement whose main goal is to dismantle Putin's regime and restore democracy in Russia."
"Kasparov was also one of the founders of The Other Russia, an opposition coalition which unites many left and nationalist politicians. He helped organize marches of dissenters involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and governors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg."
"In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency. In November 2007, he was detained by police at a rally in Moscow and given a jail sentence of five days. On 12 December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a hall where at least 500 of his supporters could meet to endorse his candidacy, as is legally required. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to discourage anyone from renting a hall for the gathering. In 2008 Kasparov and his United Civil Front joined the Solidarity movement."
Kasparov is among the 34 first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti-Putin campaign Putin must go started in March 2010.
Stanley Vann
"Stanley Vann (born Leicester, 15 February 1910 - 27 March 2010) was an English composer, organist, choral conductor, and choir trainer. He contributed a great deal to music in the Anglican church tradition. He was Director of Music at Peterborough Cathedral from 1953 to 1977. On 15 February 2010 he celebrated his 100th birthday. He died the following month."
Early life.
"Vann was born in Leicester. He started to learn the piano when he was about six years old. At the age of 17 he learned the organ, and by the time he was 20 he had passed his ARCM, ARCO and FRCO organ diplomas."
The start of a musical career.
"In 1931 he became Assistant Organist at Leicester Cathedral. In 1933 he became Organist at Gainsborough Parish Church, then went to Leamington Spa as Organist of Holy Trinity church in 1939. He started a choir and an orchestra there: the Leamington Spa Bach Choir and the Warwickshire Symphony Orchestra."
Between 1942 and 1946 he had to fight in the Second World War.
"In 1949 he got the jobs of Organist at Chelmsford Cathedral and Professor of Harmony and Counterpoint at Trinity College, London. In Chelmsford he started the Essex Symphony Orchestra."
He also trained the Leicester Philharmonic choir for the famous conductors Henry Wood and Malcolm Sargent.
Peterborough.
"In 1909 Vann became Master of the Music in Peterborough Cathedral. He stayed in this job until he retired in 1977. The choir was not particularly good when he started there, but he soon made them into an excellent choir. They made many recordings. In 1971 he was given a Lambeth doctorate by the Archbishop of Canterbury for his services to music."
"When he retired he first moved to Wansford in Cambridgeshire so that he was half way between his son (in Yorkshire) and his daughter (in Berkshire). He continued to work there, training the church choir, giving singing lessons, and composing. Later he moved to Yorkshire to be nearer to family. He died aged 100 after falling down and breaking his hip."
Compositions.
"Stanley Vann composed a great deal of music, mostly for the Anglican church service. His compositions include hymn tunes, anthems, motets, chants, organ music and many other pieces. One of his largest pieces is the Billingshurst Mass, for large chorus and orchestra. It was first performed in Chichester Cathedral in 2000."
"In 2000 a concert was given in All Saints Church, Peterborough to celebrate his 90th birthday. On Sunday 14 February 2010 many cathedrals and churches in England arranged special concerts and services to celebrate his 100th birthday"
". The BBC broadcast a special choral evensong on Radio 3 on Wednesday 24 February from Peterborough Cathedral (Wednesday 17 February is Ash Wednesday, so that a lot of his music would not have been suitable.)."
There is a scholarship in his name for young choir trainers and directors in the Anglican tradition.
Royal College of Organists
"The Royal College of Organists or RCO, is an organisation based in the United Kingdom, but with members around the world. Its job is to support organ playing and choral music. People who learn the organ can go there to take professional organ examinations."
"There is a large library with more than 60,000 books about organ playing and organ music."
"When the RCO started in 1864 by Richard Limpus it was called the ""College of Organists"". It was given a Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered an extremely cheap 99-year lease on a beautiful building in Kensington, West London. The college was there until 1991 when it moved to a church in the City of London. In 2003 it moved again to Birmingham."
"The republic territory is in the semi-desert zone which prominent feature is the completeness of a vegetative cover shown in a combination of steppe and deserted plots, and is most forestless region of the Russian Federation."
Sochi
"Sochi (Russuan:Со́чи) is a city in Russia on the Black Sea coast. It is in the Russian federal subject of Krasnodar Krai. The 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were played there. The Sochi Olympic Stadium will also be used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches. Sochi is also a popular health resort. It is one of very few places in Russia with a humid subtropical climate (""Cfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
Catherine II of Russia
"Catherine II of Russia (also titled Catherine the Great or Yekaterina Aleksei'evna) (April 21, 1729, Stettin, Germany – November 17, 1796 Tsarskoye Selo, Russia) was Empress of Russia. She came to power by a coup d'état that deposed her husband, who was killed."
"Catherine greatly increased the power of the crown. In wars against the Ottoman Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth she conquered much land in the west and south. During Catherine's rule, Russia became a strong power in Europe."
Early life.
"Catherine was born in Stettin, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time. She was the daughter of Prince Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Johanna Elizabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. She had five brothers and sisters. She married her cousin Peter III (who, like Catherine, was German) at age fifteen, and became empress of Russia at age 32. She was educated in three languages (Russian, German and French). She grew up as a Lutheran (Protestant). When she married Peter, she changed to the Russian Orthodox church."
Marriage.
"Catherine's marriage was said to be unfaithful and distraught. Peter and Catherine were each said to have several lovers. After they had been married nine years, Catherine bore a son, Paul. Paul was born on . Both parents accepted him as legitimate, even though there had been rumors about Catherine having been unfaithful. Catherine also had a daughter Anna, born in 1757. Anna died in 1759. Catherine and Peter had a very difficult relationship. When Peter died, Catherine was left to rule Russia on her own. Catherine had many lovers, probably because of the difficult marriage; over twenty lovers are known. A few of these seem to be more important:"
Reign.
"Six months after Peter took the throne, Catherine led a palace coup to overthrow him. The question of who killed him and why is still much discussed. Catherine was greatly admired by the public. She was much involved in foreign affairs, including successful Russo-Turkish Wars which conquered new territories for Russia."
Death.
"Catherine suffered a stroke on 1. Due to the stroke, she lost consciousness. She died in her bed at 9:20 the following evening, while she was still unconscious. Catherine was buried at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg."
Hiccups
"A hiccup (also spelled hiccough) is sudden tightening of the diaphragm, which is a muscle inside the chest and below the lungs that causes air to be pulled in. A short time after diaphragm contracts, the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in, and results in the ""hic"" sound that gives ""hiccups"" its name. A hiccup is a reflex, a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute, and end on their own after a few minutes."
"Sometimes a single hiccup happens, or they may happen over and over, a few times each minute, in a series called a ""bout"" of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic: the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesn't change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself, without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies (cures) are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last, because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm."
"Hiccups may be triggered (started) by several common human conditions such as swallowing air, eating very quickly, and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases."
The reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory (idea) is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly.
Napoleonic era
"The Napoléonic era was a time in the history of France and Europe. This era existed during the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution. It is the time when Napoleon ruled France. The Napoleonic era begins when Napoléon Bonaparte began to rule by overthrowing the government of France which was then called the Directory, creating the French Consulate. The era ends with Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (November 9, 1799 - June 28, 1815). Afterwards, the Congress of Vienna tried to bring Europe back to pre-French Revolution days."
It was a time of many wars in Europe.
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav state that existed from the second half of World War II (1943) until it was formally dissolved in 1992 (""de facto"" dissolved in 1991 with no leaders representing it) amid the Yugoslav wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia."
"Josip Broz Tito ruled Yugoslavia until 1980 when he died. In June 1991 Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. By 1992, only two states still wanted a union, Serbia and Montenegro. They formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was not recognized as the successor of the SFRY by international leaders."
VIPoma
"For many games, the Jokers are removed from the deck, making the total number of cards in the deck 52. Sometimes the deck is reduced to 40, 36, or 32 cards for playing certain games, like belote, sheepshead or euchre."
Tarot cards.
"There are various types of tarot cards. Tarots are commonly used for fortune-telling, although they can also be used for playing games. Conversely, people have also used standard playing cards for fortune-telling."
History.
"Playing cards have been found in 9th century China, Tang dynasty."
"Playing cards first entered Europe in the early 14th century, probably from Egypt. The suits were very similar to the tarot suits of Swords, Staves, Cups and Coins. These designs are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese card decks."
"The first documentary evidence is from Vitoria-Gasteiz (now Spain) in 1334, in which the Knights of the Band are forbidden to play cards. The next record is from Catalonia in 1371."
Wide use of playing cards in Europe can be traced from 1377 onwards.
Manufacture.
"The method of making cards has stayed the same for over a century. Cards are two thin pieces of paper stuck together with black paste. Both outer sides are printed. Inside is the design of the card face, the outer is the design for the pack as a whole. The black paste is essential to prevent sight of the face coming through when light shines on the face side. The use of the paste is the reason cards are sometimes called ""pasteboards""."
"One or two packs at a time are printed on large sheets of paper, already pasted. The individual cards are stamped out by a machine which acts like a cookie-cutter. It cuts 36,000 cards per hour. A tiny fraction of a second later the edges of the cards are squashed extra-thin. This is not obvious to the naked eye, but the effect is that the cards slide easily past each other during shuffling."
"Printed paper cards hold about 97.5% of the world market. Plastic cards do exist: they were first invented in the 1930s. They last longer than papercards, but have only 2.5% of the market."
Emperor
"An emperor is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language ""imperator"". Often it is capitalized."
"A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an ""empress"". The wife of an emperor is also called empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates."
"The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (""tennō""), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy."
"The English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an ""imperator"" was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called ""emperor"" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (""basileus"", ""autokrator"") in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (""imperator"", ""Kaiser"") in Austria and Germany, Russian Empire, Serbia and Bulgaria (""tsar""), and the Ottoman Empire (""sultan"", ""padishah"", ""khagan"", ""kaysar"") in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire."
"The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves ""King of Kings"" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (""Huangdi""), Iran (""Shah"") and Ethiopia (""Negusa negast"") are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Brazil and Mexico, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while."
"Palmdale, California"
"Palmdale is the largest city in the desert area of California. It is a suburb of Los Angeles. It has a population of 147,897 and is the 6th largest city in Los Angeles County. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, currently the 25th fastest. It has a population of 589,043 if you include the suburbs around it."
"Even though Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, it is not connected to the larger Los Angeles population area. It is separated from it by a mountain range called the San Gabriel Mountains that are over 40 miles wide and almost 2 miles high overall."
"Palmdale is the home of several airplanes used by NASA and the Air Force, giving it the nickname of ""the aerospace capital of America."""
Palmdale is the largest city in the United States without a hospital.
"Palmdale Airport will have one airline called United Airlines that flies to San Francisco, California everyday starting in June 2007."
The city's demographics is primarily Mexican and white.
History.
"In 1886, when land in the Antelope Valley sold for 50 cents an acre, a group of 50 Swiss and German families migrated from the Midwest and settled in what is now known as Palmdale. They named their new community “Palmenthal” because they had mistaken the native Joshua trees for palm trees."
The high desert community of Palmdale has rich agricultural roots and a unique aviation history.
"The City of Palmdale celebrated its 50th anniversary of incorporation on Aug. 24, 2012. It has consistently been one of the fastest-growing cities in California and in the country. Since 1980, Palmdale’s population has soared from 12,277 to 158,605. Despite its growth, Palmdale continues to cherish the small-town values of a family-oriented community while enjoying all of the conveniences of its booming retail and commercial sectors."
"In 1772 Captain Pedro Fages, a Spanish soldier in pursuit of deserting sailors, crossed the southern part of the Antelope Valley into Leona Valley."
"Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work."
"On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves."
The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.
Adenovirus vaccines.
"The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them."
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca).
"In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
Ad5-nCOV.
"The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military."
Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.
"The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration."
CoronaVac.
"The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac."
Sinopharm vaccine.
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trial.
"The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19."
Nasal vaccines.
"Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines."
Statistics.
"As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people."
"African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated than other Americans, as are people in the Southern United States."
Arthur's Nose
"Arthur's Nose is the popular first book of the book series, written and illustrated by Marc Brown. It was published in 1976. Arthur is an aardvark. The character of Arthur inspired several other picture books and was also made into an animated television series."
"In this first book, Francine the monkey teases Arthur for having a big nose. As a result, Arthur decides to get his nose cut shorter. However, instead, he leaves his nose the same and his friends are happy, except Francine."
Prey Veng province
Prey Veng is a province in Cambodia. The capital city is also named Prey Veng.
It is on the east bank of the Mekong river. The Bassac River is also in the province.
"Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she realizes her therapist was in on it and that the plane is another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin."
Cast.
"Isabelle Fuhrman and James Frain appear in the film's alternate version as Claire and Henry, respectively, in a plotline revealing the puzzlemaker's story. Tanya van Graan makes an uncredited appearance as Sonya, who is Henry's wife and Claire's mother in this cut."
"Additionally, Lucy Newman-Williams appears as Zoey's therapist and Scott Coker portrays an FBI agent in the theatrical cut. In both versions, Matt Esof portrays the vagrant who lures Zoey and Ben into Minos' trap."
Production.
"On January 27, 2020, director Adam Robitel posted on social media confirming that filming on the movie had wrapped."
Appetite for Destruction
"Appetite for Destruction is the first studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records."
"When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"". It was first on ""Billboard"" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time."
"Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, ""Appetite for Destruction"" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too."
Background.
"Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after forming, with ""Don't Cry"", a cover of ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Think About You"" and ""Anything Goes"". However, the EP did not happen, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band."
"After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP ""Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide"", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP."
"Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for ""Appetite for Destruction"", such as ""Back Off Bitch"", ""You Could Be Mine"", ""November Rain"" and ""Don't Cry"". ""November Rain"" was not put on the album because ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad."
"Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record ""Nightrain"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Don't Cry"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Shadow of Your Love"". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)"
"The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded ""Shadow of Your Love"" first with Clink as a test."
"In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman) to ""spruce up"" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie ""Big Daddy"" in 1999."
Track listing.
Super deluxe edition.
"The ""Locked N' Loaded"" Edition and the ""Super Deluxe Edition"" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album."
"A fifth disc is included; a Blu-ray disc, which has 96 kHz 24-bit 5.1 Surround Sound &amp; Remastered Stereo mixes, mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti. It includes all of ""Appetite for Destruction"", alongside bonus tracks ""Shadow of Your Love"", ""Patience"", ""Used to Love Her"", ""You're Crazy"", and ""Move to the City (1988 Acoustic version)"". In addition, it includes music videos for ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", ""Paradise City"", ""Patience"", and a previously unreleased video of ""It's So Easy""."
Personnel.
Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.
Alberto Naranjo
"Alberto Naranjo [nah-rahn'-ho] (September 14, 1941 – January 27, 2020) was a Venezuelan jazz musician and composer. In 1992, he was nominated for a Grammy Award."
"Naranjo made arrangements for the groups Conexion Latina, Guaco and Mango; pop-artists like Ilan Chester, Simón Díaz, Oscar D'León, Ricardo Montaner, María Rivas, Aldemaro Romero and Adalberto Santiago"
Jack Burns
"John Francis Burns (November 15, 1933 – January 27, 2020) was an American comedian, actor, screenwriter, and producer. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts."
"During the 1960s, he was part of two stand-up comedy partnerships, first with George Carlin and later Avery Schreiber. He was a writer and producer on such comedy series as ""The Muppet Show"" and ""Hee Haw"". His television roles included ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Animaniacs""."
"His son Brian and daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company. His daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, plays the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson."
"One of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It is called Muppet*Vision 3D. It opened in 1991, shortly after his death."
Game Boy Advance Video
"Game Boy Advance Video is a format of cartridges for the Game Boy Advance. They work the same as normal cartridge but play television shows instead of games. They generally contain 45 minutes of TV, for example, a show from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. They were first made in early 2004, but gradually stopped being made shortly before there were no more Game Boy Advance games made in 2008, with the final game for it being Samurai Deeper KYO."
Butterfly
"A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved. The earliest discovered fossil moth dates to 200 million years ago."
"The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants, which their larvae (caterpillars) feed on, and their adults feed and lay their eggs on. They have a long-lasting history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa. The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below."
"Angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved in the Lower Cretaceous, but did not become common until the Upper Cretaceous. Butterflies were the last major group of insects to appear on the planet. They evolved from moths in the latest Cretaceous or the earliest Cainozoic. The earliest known butterfly fossils date to the mid Eocene epoch, between 40 and 50 million years ago."
"Like moths, butterflies have four wings covered with tiny scales. When a butterfly is not flying, its wings are usually folded over its back. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. There are many different kinds of butterflies. The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught."
"Like all insects with complete metamorphosis, a butterfly's life goes through four distinct stages. It begins as an egg, which hatches into a larva (a caterpillar). After some time, the larva turns into a chrysalis. While it is in the chrysalis stage, it changes to become an adult butterfly. To complete the cycle, adults mate and the females lay the eggs."
"Butterflies are any of the species belonging to the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hedyloidea. Butterflies, along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their distribution."
Predators and defences.
Predators.
"The main predators of butterflies are birds, just as the main predators of the crepuscular moths are bats. Also monkeys and tree-dwelling reptiles are predators, and some insects and spiders. All reptiles and monkeys have good colour vision, so that butterfly coloration works just as well on them as it does on birds."
Defences.
The extraordinary colours and patterns on the wings and body can only be understood in terms of their function. Some of the most obvious functions of colour are:
"The details vary from group to group, and from species to species. The caterpillars also have colours with similar functions. The poisonous substances which make some butterflies noxious to eat are got from the plants eaten by their caterpillars."
Body.
"Like most insects, butterflies have three main body parts. These parts are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The body is protected by the exoskeleton. The body is made up of sections, known as segments. In between the segments there are flexible areas that allow the butterfly to move. All three parts of the body are covered in very small scales. The scales give the butterfly its colour."
Wings and flight.
Butterflies have a very characteristic flying style. They usually do not fly in straight lines. Their style is well described by the children's version of their name: 'flutter-by'. The way they fly presumably makes them harder for birds to catch.
"Some species are capable of strong, long flights (see monarch butterfly migration) and others never leave the woods they were born in. They can survive bird pecks on the wings. Late in the season damage to their wings can often be seen, though they continue flying quite well."
"When they are alive, it is often difficult to see they have four wings. The wings on each side are linked by a row of little hooks. So in practice they fly as if they had one large wing on each side."
Head.
"The head is the first part of the body. It has the eyes, mouth parts, and antennae."
"The eyes of a butterfly are large. Like other adult insects, the eye is made up of many small lenses or ""optical units"". these are compound eyes. Butterflies do not see as many colours as humans, but they can see ultraviolet light."
"The mouth of an adult butterfly does not have jaws. It has a kind of mouth that sucks liquids. This mouth is made of two hollow tubes. The tubes are locked together in the middle. When the butterfly is not drinking, the tubes are coiled up. It can uncoil them when it wants to drink. Like all insects, the adult phase is about reproduction. The main eating phase is done by the larvae, which usually eat plant food."
"The antennae of a butterfly are used for smell and balance. The antenna in most butterflies is clubbed at the end. In some butterflies (like the skippers), there is a hook at the end of the antenna, instead of a club."
Thorax.
The thorax is the second part of the body. It is made up of three segments. The legs and wings are connected to the thorax.
"Much later, in the 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."
History.
"During the 10th through 13th centuries, when the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia, modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms:"
"These three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. Then, the Protestant Reformation happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814. It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland."
"The borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some territory to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre &amp; Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia). The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway."
"Finland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times. During the wars fought by Napoleon, it became part of Russia."
Minerva (automobile)
"In 1883 a young Belgian called Sylvain de Jong settled in Antwerp, Belgium. He started a bicycle factory there. By the end of that century he started producing motorbikes, and after a while automobiles as well. In 1903 he grounded the NV Minerva Motors' in Berchem (Antwerp)."
"A certain Charles S Rolls was Minerva dealer in England. The small 1 cylinder ""Minervette"" was there with its 105 Pound, the cheapest automobile."
"In the years after the fame of the automobile was rising enormous. Most important market for the constructor remained however England that took the biggest part of the production, followed by the Netherlands and France."
"From 1908 Minerva got a worldwide Knight licence. The Knight motor was a motor without valves, developed by Charles Y Knight in the United States. These motors were extremely silent. The company did well in several automobile racing competitions in Europe."
"After worldwar I, during which Sylvain de Jong and his engineers headed to Amsterdam, where they kept on developing parts, they returned to start up the production of luxury automobiles. The constructors star rose in the United States as well, American filmstars, politicians and industrials liked them cars as well (even Henry Ford had before the WW already one!). The car had the same qualities as the Rolls Royce, but was a little cheaper. With the economical crisis in the 30's, the company went bankrupt in 1936. The remains were taken over by another Belgian constructor named Imperia. Imperia putted the name Minerva on their automobiles for export to England and France and for the trucks (which Minerva had made before too)."
After worldwar II the company produced Land Rovers under licence for the Belgian army. Production of these 4Wheel Drives stopped in 1953. The company struggled for survival and made some Land Rover-like cars till 1956. But than the constructor diappeared completely.
E. B. White
"Elwyn Brooks White (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985) was an American writer."
"He is most famous for his 1959 manual about how to write well in English, ""The Elements of Style"" (which was first written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918), and also for his three children's books ""Stuart Little"" (1945), ""Charlotte's Web"" (1952), and the ""Trumpet of the Swan"" (1970)."
He also wrote for magazines and newspapers in the United States.
"E.B. White won many awards, including a Pulitzer Prize."
Raffles Institution
"Raffles Institution is a highly regarded secondary school in Singapore, often considered the best school in the country. Only boys can go to this school. It has been performing well in studies and sports. It was founded in 1823 as Singapore Institution by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. It is the school with the longest history in Singapore. Its name was changed to ""Raffles Institution"" in 1868. It has two sections, Raffles Institution and Raffles Institution Junior College."
"The current principal of Raffles Institution is Mr Frederick Yeo, who replaced Mr Chan Poh Meng when he left the school at the end of 2017."
History.
"Sir Stamford Raffles founded Raffles Institution on 5 June 1823, making it the school with the longest history in Singapore. Raffles Institution was along Bras Basah Road at first, where Raffles City is now. The school moved to Grange Road in 1973, and then moved to its current location at Bishan in 1990. The Grange Road campus is now the MOE Teacher's Network."
Archipelago
"An archipelago () is a chain or group of islands. The word ""archipelago"" means ""chief sea"", from Greek ""arkhon"" (""arkhi""-) (""leader"") and ""pelagos"" (""sea"")."
"Archipelagos are usually found in the open sea; less commonly, a big landmass may neighbor them, an example being Scotland which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland. Many archipelagos are volcanic, forming along mid-ocean ridges or hotspots. Others are island arcs neighboring an oceanic trench. Many other processes create archipelagos, including erosion, deposition, and land elevation."
"The four biggest countries that are mainly archipelagos are Japan, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Indonesia (the world's biggest country that is an archipelago, according to the CIA World Factbook). The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern Canada, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which is in the Arctic Ocean."
"Beecham once met a lady he knew, but could not remember who she was. He asked her whether she was well."
Teatro Colón
"The Teatro Colón (Spanish) (Columbus Theatre) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is one of the world's best known opera houses."
In 2006 the theatre was closed so that work could be done to improve the inside of the building. It reopened in 2010
"There had been a theatre there in the middle of the 19th century. The present building was opened in 1908. The auditorium is horseshoe-shaped and has 2,487 seats. The acoustics of the building are very good. It is in the middle of Buenos Aires."
"Many world famous conductors, composers and singers have appeared at the theatre."
Bim Bum Bam
"Bim Bum Bam, (1982-2003), was an Italian children's and teens' television programme."
"""Bim Bum Bam"" was produced by Alessandra Valeri Manera and created by Paolo Bonolis and Giancarlo Muratori."
Puyi
"Aisin-Giro Puyi or Emperor Puyi (, February 7, 1906–October 17, 1967) was the last Emperor of China. He was crowned emperor in 1908 at the age of three. His era name as Qing emperor, ""Xuantong"", means ""proclamation of unity"". On February 12, 1912, during the Xinhai Revolution, he was forced to abdicate. He later became the ruler of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo during World War II. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs."
"When he was two years old, in 1908, he became the Xuantong Emperor (then spelled as Hsuan Tung Emperor). At the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. He was forced to give up all political power, but he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City. In turn, he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City."
"In 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses."
"After Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to stop the treasury from getting robbed. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft. He also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace."
"In 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria in 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. Chinese media and writers accused the Japanese and collaborators like Puyi of being homosexuals as an insult."
"After the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China. For the next ten years, the former emperor was in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards said that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing. He spent the rest of his life there as a common citizen. He worked as a gardener and then an editor. He earned 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home."
Lithium (Nirvana song)
"""Lithium"" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana which featured on their second album ""Nevermind"". Kurt Cobain wrote the song. He said the song is about a man who became religious after his girlfriend died."
Endocrinology
Endocrinology studies the working of the endocrine system and hormones.
"It is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in."
The endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.
"Hormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology."
Medical aspects.
"Medical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone."
An endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:
These are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.
Certifications and sales.
"In February 2008, RIAA reduced the certification-award-levels for Oro y De Platino to Gold=50,000 and Platinum=100,000."
Ones (album)
"Ones is a greatest hits album by Selena. The album included an unreleased ballad song. The album sold over 500,000 copies in the United States."
Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front
JKLF seeks independence of Jammu and Kashmir state from both India and Pakistan.
"The JKLF claims that they are not Islamist, but are nationalist, and opposes the emergence of the territories into either Pakistan or India but rather wants the region of Kashmir to separate from the three countries and become independent."
"In 1982 branches were established in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Pakistan and in 1987 in Indian-administered Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir)."
Mirador de la Flor
"Mirador de la Flor () is a life-sized statue that is in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue is a memorial to American singer Selena. The statue was ordered by the Mayor of Corpus Christi as a tourist attraction in 1997. Hundreds of fans visit the statue weekly from all over the world. The statue faces Corpus Christi bay, where the gun that killed Selena was thrown. A second life-sized statue of Selena was made in Mexico in March 2011."
Marie Joséphine of Savoy
"Marie Joséphine of Savoy (Maria Giuseppina Luigia; 2 September 1753 – 13 November 1810) was the wife of the future Louis XVIII of France. She was a princess of Savoy by birth, became the titular Queen consort, and was known by her title: Her Royal Highness, Countess of Provence (""comtesse de Provence"")."
Family.
"She was born at the Royal Palace of Turin on 2 September 1753 and was the third child and second daughter of Victor Amadeus and his wife the Spanish Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain. At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia."
Marriage.
"Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 ""by proxy"" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court."
"In France she was known as Marie Joséphine de Savoie. She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king. She was a cousin of the ill-fated ""Princess of Lamballe"" who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage. At the death of her husband’s grandfather Louis XV in 1774, her brother-in-law succeeded as Louis XVI. She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781, but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage. In 1791 Marie Joséphine went to Germany. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple."
"Marie Joséphine died of an edema at Hartwell House, English residence of the exiled French royal family. Marie Joséphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Her body was removed a year later on Louis's orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia; today in Cagliari Cathedral."
Islam in Palestine
"Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories, with Muslims comprising 75% of the population of the West Bank, and 99% of the population of the Gaza Strip."
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The ""Haram al Sharif"" (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah (paradise); there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran, however."
This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims are sensitive to and mindful of the circumstance that two mosques along with the rest of East Jerusalem are claimed and illegally occupied by the state of Israel.
Specific impulse
"Specific impulse (often shortened to ""I""sp) is a way to describe how well a rocket performs. It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well."
"Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like ""miles per gallon"" or ""litres per 100 kilometres"" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted."
"A rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage."
Fifth war.
"In 1574, the fifth war began. The Catholic monarchy faced an alliance between the Protestants and a new group, known as the ""Malcontents,"" Who were were Catholic noblemen who opposed the policies of the monarchy and wanted religious toleration for the Protestants. In 1575, King Henry III's younger brother, Francis, known as the Duke of Alençon, joined the Malcontents and raised an army. Henry III gave up and in 1576 agreed to a peace treaty with the Malcontents and Protestants. Called the Peace of Beaulieu, gave a lot of land and money to the Duke of Alençon and to the Malcontents. Many of the Malcontents, including Alençon, were satisfied and became loyal to the King and the Catholics again."
Sixth war.
"In late 1576, the sixth war began. The Protestants no longer had as many allies and lost the important cities of La Charité and Issoire. However, the King did not have enough money to continue the war and defeat the Protestants totally and so the war ended in 1577."
Seventh war.
"The seventh war began in 1580 when Henry of Navarre, the most important Protestant leader, attacked the Catholic city of Cahors. He conquered the city, but the Catholics captured the Protestant city of La Mure later that year. In November 1580, another peace treaty was signed."
"In 1584, the Duke of Alençon died. King Henry III was the only living son of King Henry II (reigned from 1547 to 1559), and the next man in line to become king was the Protestant Henry of Navarre. Many Catholics wanted King Henry III to disown Henry of Navarre and to make someone else the heir to the throne because were scared of a Protestant becoming king, but Henry III refused."
Eighth war.
"In 1585, the Catholics, led by Henry of Guise, raised an army and forced King Henry III to outlaw Protestantism in France. The war that followed, the eighth war, is also known as the ""War of the Three Henrys"" and is named after King Henry III, Henry of Guise, and Henry of Navarre. Even though Henry III and Henry of Guise were on the same side in 1585, many Catholics feared that Henry III secretly wanted Henry of Navarre to be the next king. In 1588, the supporters of Henry of Guise, known as ""Leaguers,"" chased King Henry III out of Paris. In 1589, afraid that Henry of Guise wanted to take the throne from him, Henry III had him murdered, fled to the Protestant army, and joined forces with Henry of Navarre. Charles of Mayenne, Henry of Guise's brother, became the leader of the Leaguers."
"The Royal-Protestant army defeated the Leaguers at the Battle of Senlis and surrounded Paris. Before they could capture the city, King Henry III was killed by a Leaguer but named as his heir Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, before he died. The King if France was now Henry IV, who defeated Leaguer armies at the Battle of Arques (1589) and the Battle of Ivry (1590) but could not completely defeat the Leaguers. In 1593, King Henry IV converted to Catholicism."
End.
"After six more years of fighting, the Leaguers gave up, and the war ended. Henry IV pardoned those who had fought against him, and made a settlement allowing Catholics and Protestants to practice their faith within certain limits."

Streptomyces
"Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria. ""Streptomyces"" is often found in soil and is very much similar to fungi by its shape. They form long thin threads called hyphae that can differentiate into a chain of spores for reproduction. Almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by ""Streptomyces"" are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium."
Use in medicine and science.
"Streptomyces are medically important, as they produce antifungals, antiparasitic drugs, antivirals, antitumorals, anti-hypertensives, immunosuppressants and antibiotics. Different species of streptomyces are used to produce different antibiotics. Over 500 species of ""Streptomyces"" bacteria have been described. For example, widely studied ""S. griseus"" was the first to be used in production of an antibiotic streptomycin, while ""S. avermitilis"" as a source of avermictin. Another well-studied species, ""S coelicolor"", is widely used in genetic studies. Overall, Streptomyces produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin, such as tetracycline, neomycin and chloramphenicol."
Antibiotic mechanism.
"Antibiotics target essential proteins for pathogens’ growth and survival, inhibiting essential functions. For example, streptomycin, which is made from ""S. griseus,"" irreversibly binds to bacterial genetic material and causes errors in the production of new proteins, which leads to cell death. It can be used for treating severe infections, such as tuberculosis and plague. Another example is avermectin, made from ""S. avermitili."" It causes invertebrate paralysis (inability to make and pass nerve impulses), which is used as a drug and pesticide against parasitic worms and insects. Avermectin enhances glutamate (neurotransmitter) at the glutamate-gated chloride channels that mammals don’t possess. It causes the excess of chloride ions inside the cell (hyperpolarisation), so the action potential cannot be further induced, ultimately leading to paralysis."

Roseanna's Grave
"Roseanna's Grave (also known as For Roseanna) is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film directed by Paul Weiland. In his review, Roger Ebert concludes that ""Roseanna's Grave"" ""isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears of the plot are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it."""

Serial-position effect
"The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon. It say that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list. They are less likely to remember the middle items. The term was created in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus. He was a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list. This ability is called free-recall. Ebbinghaus performed free-recall experiments on himself. He used a list of 2000 syllables. THe experiments showed him that the where the it was on the list affected how well he could remember it. This information is shown in the ""serial position curve"". The serial position curve shows two things. The first thing it showed him was that the first 2-3 items on the list and up to the last 8 items in a list are always remembered better than items in the middle. This was true in any list with 20 or more items. It also showed him that the size of the list and the speed at which it was preseted did not affect the outcome."
Free Recall.
"Free recall is a way of experimenting that is used in psychology. It is used to test memory. Free recall is the most common method of studying the serial position effect. to use free recakk, a person is shown a list of items. These items are normally words. The person is then asked to say which items they can remember from the list in any order. One major problem with this method is that the tests are usually done in a controlled environment. This means the result may not be different from what happens in the real world."
Primacy effect.
"The primary effect is the term used to mean that people often remember the first thing they are told. Many psychologists think that this effect may be a result of rehearsal. When a person is trying to remember the items, that person will often repeat the items to themselves. As each item is added to the list, they repeat the entire list. This causes them to repeat the first it many time. This constant repeating helps them to better remember the items at the begining of the list,The slower the list is presented, the more time a person has to repeat the list. This causes a larger primacy effect."
"In the 1970s, psychologists began testing the effect of rehearsal on the primacy effect. In 1972, psychologist Phillip Marshal tested if removing rehearsal would have an affect on the primacy effect. He did this by having the people sort the words while he was giving them a list of 18 common nouns. The people in the test were not told that their memmory was being tested. Since they did not know this, they did not repeat the words as they heard them. The experiments showed Marshal that removing the repeating also removed most of the primacy effect. It showed that rehearsal was a main cause for the primacy effect."
"In 1971, Dewey Rundus created a what he called ""overt rehearsal"" The people were told to say their thoughts out loud, This tested test ""how"" and ""when"" participants rehearsed each item in a list. In 1977, Brodie and Murdock used overt rehearsal to give an alternate explanation for the primacy effect. They learned that even as people got towards the end of the list, they were still repeating the first terms. This caused the items to still be inthe person's short-term memory (STM) near the end of the list. This created what is called a ""recency effect"". Brodie and Murdock said that rehearsal is a main cause of the primacy effect. They also believed that the primacy effect may be a type of ""recency effect""."
Recency effect.
"The recency effect is the ability to remember items near the end of a list. Unlike the primacy effect, changes in speed and the size of the list do not affect the recency effect. Psychologists have learned that asking people to list the items in the ‘order they were presented’ causes less recency effect. In a 1966 study, Glanzer and Kunitz learned that increasing the time between when the list is presented and when recall is tested can affect the recency effect. With just an added 30 second delay, there was no longer a recency effect. In 1990, researchers tried to distract the people during the test. They would have the person do something that stopped short-term memory (rehearsal). For example, they would have the person countbackward from 3. The results showed that this also removed the recency effect."
"Certain IP addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network. Since they are not unique, they are not routed on the internet. The addresses which can be freely assigned are called private IP addresses, and the ones which are unique are called public. To be routed, a private address needs to be translated into a public one. This process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation, or NAT. Routers and firewalls often also perform this task."
Reaching one or more devices.
There are three different types of addresses:
Obtaining a new IP address.
"There are different ways of getting a new IP address. One of them is called Bootstrap Protocol (usually shortened to BOOTP). The device that needs a new address, does not know what network it is in, so it uses an IP address of all zeroes (0.0.0.0) which it sends as a broadcast to the current network, on a special port. In addition, it sends the MAC address of the network card, plus a 4 byte random number. The BOOTP server will send a reply, also as broadcast, addressed to a different port. The reply will contain the mac address of the client, the random number, and the IP address of the client. When the client receives the data, it will set the address specified. If the BOOTP server is configured that way, it will also send the IP address and hostname of the BOOTP Server, the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client (using TFTP) or the name of a directory, which the client should mount using NFS."
"DHCP extends BOOTP, and allows to send more information, such as the address of a time server, or information which is useful for routing."
"IP addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static. Static addressing means the same machine will always get the same IP address. With dynamic addresses, a device will get the next address which is not used. Dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time. If they are not renewed, they can be used for other devices."
IP Version 4.
"With IPv4, each address consists of four 8-digit binary numbers, called octets. An IPv4 address is 32 bits in total. The biggest number one can make with 8 regular digits is 99,999,999, but the biggest number one can make with 8 binary digits is 255 (11111111 in binary), so each octet can be any number from 0 to 255."
An IPv4 address could look something like this:
Each octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period.
"There are also special meanings associated with two different ending numbers. In general, a last number of 0 stands for the network (called ""base address""), and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network (called ""broadcast address""). Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers. A computer can be on more than one network. It can also have several names."
Public/Private addresses.
"The problem with IPv4 is that it only allows for 4.3 billion addresses, and we've almost used them all. To delay this, Network Address Translation (NAT) was created. Network Address Translation has a network share one ""public"" IP address and give every computer on the network a ""private"" IP address. Everyone living in the same house uses the same address, but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house."
Special IP addresses.
"There are some IP addresses that are reserved for special purposes. For example, the address ""127.0.0.1"" is called the Loopback Address and will ""loop back"" any packets sent to this address back to the computer that sent them, like sending mail to yourself. Although this may not seem useful, it is used to test servers."
Network.
It identifies the class of a network.
Host Part.
It identifies the host on a network.
Static IP Address.
It is a permanent internet address. It has to be configured manually. It is used in smaller networks. All servers use static IP addresses. It is a simple way for communication.
Dynamic IP Address.
It is a temporary internet address. It is assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server from a specific range of IP address.
IPv4 subnetting.
"To make a network work faster, it is split up into subnets. To do this, an IP address contains a ""network"" ID, ""subnet"" ID, and a ""host"" ID. A special binary number called a Subnet Mask is used to determine the size of the network, subnet, and host IDs."
"The original IPv4 only supported 254 networks, so in 1981 the Internet addressing specification was changed to a classful network architecture. Classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual networks. The first three bits of an IP address determined its ""class"". Three classes (""A"", ""B"", and ""C"") were defined for normal computer communication (Unicast). The size of the network ID was based on the class of the IP address. Each class used more octets for the network ID, making the host ID smaller and reducing the number of possible hosts."
"Classful networks have been replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) since 1993. CIDR also provides a network address and host address. CIDR does not have classes, which means network and host address sizes don't have to be in octets."
"An IPv4 Address in CIDR notation looks like192.168.0.14/24The slash and number represent the amount of bits that the network id uses, in this case 24 or 3 octets."
IP Version 6.
"Because IPv4 is only 32 bits, the number of available addresses will run out. To prevent this, an organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created IP Version 6 (IPv6), which will eventually finish replacing IPv4."
"IP Version 6 uses 8 octets each 16 bits = 128 bits in total. Octets in IPv6 are written in hexadecimal, and separated by colons (:). An IPv6 address might look like this:"

Locating (physics)
"The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what ""to locate"" or ""location"" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something."
"For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, ""Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone."" Or, in another case we might say, ""Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles."
"If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, ""Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."""
"Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar."
"It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion."
"Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction."
Let 'Em In
"""Let 'Em In"" is a single released in 1976, performed by Paul McCartney. The song reached the Top 3 in the United States and across the United Kingdom. This single has been covered and sampled by other musicians."
Trajectory
"The Trajectory something follows is its path through space and time. If a cannon is fired, its shell will follow a certain path depending on how much was used, how heavy the is, and the up and down that the cannon is aimed at."
Ed Dyas
"Edmund C. Dyas (November 11, 1939 – January 23, 2011) was an American football player. He played college football from 1958 to 1960 for the Auburn Tigers. He finished fourth for the Heisman Trophy in his senior season. Dyas was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009."
"Dyas became an orthopedic surgeon in Mobile, Alabama after his college football career. He died from stomach cancer on January 23, 2011 at the age of 71."
"Wayne County, Michigan"
"Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, 1,820,584 people lived there. It is the 18th most-populous county in the United States. The county seat is Detroit which is the largest city in Michigan."
History.
"Wayne County was one of the first counties formed when the Northwest Territory was created. It was named for the American general ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne. When it was created, the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and small sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were part of Wayne County. On August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were set to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point."
"On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, changed the boundary. This new boundary included Chicago, Illinois and a large strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan."
These boundaries were later changed again when Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were created in Michigan Territory.
Geography.
"The county has a total area of . Of this, (or 91.36%) is land and (or 8.64%) is water Parts of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair are included in the county."
"The eastern boundary is a water boundary in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair with Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Cars crosses this boundary at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge."
Grosse Ile is the largest island in Wayne County. It is connected to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge.
"The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle."
Geography.
"The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar."
"In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border."
"In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific."
"The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres."
"The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is deep."
Gulf Stream.
"The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents. One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic. Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole. This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole."
"There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa."
Geology.
"The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south."
The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.
Mercury
Mercury may mean:
Mercury (element)
"Mercury, also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum (pronounced hai-DRAR-jər-əm), is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. Its atomic mass is 200.59."
"The symbol ""Hg"" stands for its Latinized Greek name ""hydrargyrum"", meaning watery or liquid silver."
History.
No one has the credit for finding mercury. It was known in ancient times. Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that are from 2000 BC.
"Chinese people also knew it from long ago. In China and Tibet, people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health. One of China's emperors, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì, is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury. He died from drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever. However, this only made him die of liver failure, poisoning, and brain death. The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments. The Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics. These cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier."
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Mercury is a silvery-white liquid post-transition metal. The reason for mercury being a liquid is complex. It is heavy; a chunk of iron can float on mercury. Compared to other metals, it does not conduct heat well. However, it conducts electricity fairly well. Mercury is the only metal with a known melting point (−38.83 °C) lower than caesium. Mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure. Bromine is the other one."
"Mercury may be seen as a transition metal, but it is normally seen as a post-transition metal. It is in Group 12 of the periodic table. Mercury has seven stable (nonradioactive) isotopes. 202Hg is the most common isotope. Mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it. The ultraviolet light can kill germs or light fluorescent lamps."
Chemical properties.
"Mercury is an unreactive metal. It does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there, similar to silver. Mercury can oxidize to mercury(II) oxide when heated in air. If it is heated further, it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again. It does not dissolve in ordinary acids, but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts. It can make amalgams when mixed with most metals, like aluminium, gold, and zinc. Iron, tantalum, tungsten, and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury. Iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this."
"Mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal, making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers. The thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating (making an amalgam with) aluminium, but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal. Then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide. The aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury, which amalgamates more aluminium. This process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved."
Chemical compounds.
"Mercury forms chemical compounds in 2 oxidation states: +1 and +2. Mercury(I) compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents. Most of them are colorless. They easily disproportionate to mercury(II) compounds and mercury metal. They react with oxygen in the air to make mercury(II) compounds. Many mercury(I) compounds do not dissolve in water. Mercury(I) chloride is one of the most common mercury(I) compounds. Mercury(II) compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive. Mercury(II) compounds are red, yellow, or colorless. Mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) chloride are the most common mercury(II) compounds in the laboratory."
"In classical antiquity, the river was known as the ""Ōxus"" in Latin and Ὦξος ""Oxos"" in Greek."
"The name ""Amu"" is said to have come from the medieval city of ""Āmul"", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as ""Türkmenabat""), in modern Turkmenistan. ""Darya"" is the Persian word for ""river""."
"Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's ""Wakhan Corridor"", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's"" Kyzyl Kum"" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times."
In hadith.
"In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan)."
As the river Jayhan.
"Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Jayhan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghanastan historians. ."
Description.
"The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D."
"Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the ""Syr Darya"" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek)."
Watershed.
"About of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan."
"Of the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river."
"This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the ""Zeravshan River"") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe."
"The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and ""Tian Shan"","
"which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about ."
History.
The Amu Darya is (also theJayhan river)
"was called the ""Oxus"" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river Jayhan was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river Jayhan drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Jayhan river northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea."
"It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian."
"People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities."
"The first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Viné collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862."
"The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built."
Literature.
"The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus."
Founding Fathers of the United States
"The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, either helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term ""Founding Fathers"" was first used for these people in 1916."
"There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison."
"Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. Most of them owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government. Five of them, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, were later elected president of the United States."
CNDO/2
"Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart."
Forced disappearance of Stuart Angel.
"Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October (""Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro"" – MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames ""Paulo"" and ""Henrique"". He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police."
"Officers of the Air Force Information Center (""Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica"" – CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from rasphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found."
Aftermath.
"Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book ""History of the Brazilian Republic"" by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed."
Death.
"Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events."
"In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named"
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this boo he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others."
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdigão had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission."
Homages and cultural references.
"Stuart Angel is the patron of Juventude Revolucionária 8 de Outubro, MR-8's youth branch. MR-8 is now a faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement."
"The lyrics of the song ""Cálice"", written by Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil make reference tp Stuart's probable death by asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In homage to Zuzu Angel, and other mothers who were unable to bury their children, Buarque wrote the song ""Angélica"" in 1977."
"In 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the ""movie Zuzu Angel"", directed by Sérgio Rezende. The movie, in which Daniel de Oliveira plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death."
"The Tunnel Dois Irmãos, which connects Gávea to São Conrado, the same place where Zuzu's car crashed, was renamed after her."
"In 2015, Angel was commemorated on her 94th birthday with a Google Doodle featuring a motif adapted from the prints she used in her designs."
Levitating
"""Levitating"" is a song by English recording artist Dua Lipa, from her second studio album, ""Future Nostalgia"" (2020). The song was released as a remix with American rapper DaBaby on October 1, 2020. It was written by Dua Lipa, Sarah Hudson, Clarence Coffee Jr., and KOZ, who produced the song with Stuart Price."
It is a funk and disco-boogie song that runs for three minutes and 24 seconds.
"The DaBaby remix of the song has peaked at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 and at number two on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in the US, tying her peak there with ""Don't Start Now"". After DaBaby allegedly made homophobic remarks at a concert, his credit was removed from the remix on the Hot 100."
"""Levitating"" topped the US year-end Hot 100 for 2021, marking the first time in 20 years that a song that did not reach number one on the weekly chart topped the year-end chart, since Lifehouse's ""Hanging by a Moment"" in 2001. It also topped the year-end Canadian Hot 100 for 2021. It also became the longest-running song in the top ten by a lead female in ""Billboard"" history, breaking the record set by LeAnn Rimes' ""How Do I Live""."
Dasing
Dasing is a municipality in the district of Aichach-Friedberg in Bavaria in Germany.
"Eurasburg, Swabia"
Eurasburg () is a municipality in the district of Aichach-Friedberg in Bavaria in Germany.
Inchenhofen
"Inchenhofen (also known as ""Leahad"" in the local dialect) is a municipality in the district of Aichach-Friedberg in Bavaria in Germany."
"Water is also used for recreational purposes, ""see list of water sports""."
Water is used as both the coolant and the neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors. This may be ordinary water (called light water in the nuclear industry) or heavy water.
"Water is also used for washing a lot of objects. Goods, services and people are transported to other countries in watercrafts on bodies of water."
Water is used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant. Water is also used in fire fighting. Water is also used for cooking.
Dihydrogen monoxide parody.
"The dihydrogen monoxide parody involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name ""dihydrogen monoxide"" (DHMO) and listing some of its harmful effects in an alarming way. Some examples include talking about how ""it causes burning, suffocation and corrosion,"" when it is actually just talking about hot water, drowning and rust. Sometimes the parody calls for it to be banned and/or labelled as dangerous."
The prank works because it takes advantage of people's misunderstanding. Calling water by an unfamiliar name and making it sound like a harmful chemical can make people think it is dangerous.
"""Dihydrogen monoxide"" is an alternative chemical name for water, but nobody uses it. The word ""dihydrogen"" means two hydrogens, and ""monoxide"" means one oxygen. The chemical formula of water has two hydrogens and one oxygen."
"The parody gained most of its popularity in the 1990s, when a 14-year-old named Nathan Zohner collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility. Zohner fooled a lot of people, which has led to his project being used in lessons about critical thinking and the scientific method."
"The website DHMO.org is a joke website which lists the harmful effects of water (DHMO), answers questions, and calls for it to be banned, among other things."
Origin of the Earth's water.
The weirdness of water.
"A BBC short item explains that every molecule on Earth has existed for billions of years, and all of them came from elsewhere. Water is alien because it arrived on asteroids and comets. It is the second most common molecule in the universe. Why is it not a gas? It is made of two very light elements. Ice floating on water is also an oddity. Also, hot water freezes faster than cold, and no-one knows why this is. Molecules of water can move up against the force of gravity (that is due to surface adhesion)."
Water in the universe.
Much of the universe's water is produced as a by-product of star formation.
"On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing ""140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined"" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the ""discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence""."
"Water has been detected in interstellar clouds in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too. Its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients."
Origin of water on Earth: Possibilities.
"We do not know exactly how the Earth came to have so much water. It is everywhere in the Universe, but it is uncommon for a place to have so much. Reasoning from first principles, every element except hydrogen has been formed in stars. Therefore, oxygen was originally formed in stars. The formation of water is not a problem: it is exothermic, so forming the molecule from its atoms does not need outside energy. But to explain why the Earth has so much compared to, for example, Mars, is not easy. It is an undecided problem in planetary geology."
"For a while, people thought Earth’s water did not come from the planet’s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was thought that water and other volatiles must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. But hydrogen inside the Earth did play some role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas may each be partly right. Water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals (asteroids) in the outer edges of the asteroid belt. How much is not known."
Water Vapor.
Water vapor is the gas form of water and is found in:
Liquid Water.
"Liquid water is found on Earth. It covers about 71% of the surface of the Earth. Liquid water is sometimes found in small amounts on Mars. Scientists believe that liquid water is in the moons Enceladus, Titan, Europa and Ganymede."
Frozen Water.
The frozen form of water (ice) is found in:
Want
"A want is a wish or a desire for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to need, which is when someone ""must"" have something."
"People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can ""need"" to eat food and can ""want"" to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer hungry) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met."
"In economics, a want is about goods or services. Choice is how to satisfy a want, when there are different ways to do this."
"Want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor, hungry or with no money. Charles Dickens wrote a famous book called ""A Christmas Carol"" in which there are two children, named Want and Ignorance."
"In 1814, Napoleon I abdicated the French throne. That freed up experienced British troops to be sent to North America. They burned the unfinished Washington, DC, and also attacked Baltimore. An American lawyer, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem about the Battle of Baltimore. The poem was later used to give the words to a song that later became the US national anthem: ""The Star Spangled Banner."" The war ended in 1815. The British attacked New Orleans but were stopped by the Americans under General Andrew Jackson."
"Unknown by both sides, a peace treaty had already been signed."
Peace.
"The two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent to end the war, on December 24, 1814 in Belgium. Fighting continued into January 1815 because the forces did not know about the treaty, but no great changes took place afterward. The British stopped impressing sailors because the Napoleonic Wars had been finished."
"Most Americans heard of the victory in the Battle of New Orleans before they heard of the treaty. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, became disliked as pro-British and soon disappeared."
Winner.
"From the British perspective, the War of 1812 was a minor sideshow. The Americans called it their victorious ""Second War for Independence"". The British remembered it as the Americans trying to take advantage of their being involved in a war against the French Empire and paid no attention to American grievances."
"In Canada, the War of 1812 was an unwanted war. It concerned the distant capitals of Washington, DC, and London, not them. In Lower Canada, now Quebec, it was considered an Anglo-Saxon war. In Quebec there was little love for the British, but the British had guaranteed their right to speak French. Since they did not know what would happen if the Americans took over, they chose the lesser evil and supported the British."
"Upper Canada (later part of the Province of Ontario) had been settled by American Loyalists who fled after the Revolutionary War. They had little love of their former countrymen in the US but had become outnumbered by Americans who later came north to settle. When the Americans attempted to invade Canada, the Canadian militias were eager to defend their homeland."
"In US history, the War of 1812 is the most obscure conflict. The average American remembers very little about the war. Some may remember The Star Spangled Banner, the Burning of Washington, or the Battle of New Orleans. Otherwise, it is a little-understood conflict. The issues are complex. Most scholars would agree it was fought over maritime issues. Since the British Navy was then the most powerful in the world, it was easier to attack the British on land by invading Canada. Former US President Thomas Jefferson predicted the ""acquisition of Canada, will be a mere matter of marching."""
"British who knew about the little war felt that they had won, no matter what Americans thought. Canadians kept their independence from the US and so felt that they had won. The Americans felt they won although they lost in Canada since they lost none of their territory, repelled the invasion of Maryland, were free to fight the Indians without British interference, and were no longer impressed on the high seas. Of all three, the British are perhaps the happiest because they have completely forgotten about the war."
Chandigarh
"Chandigarh, also called ""The Beautiful City"", is a city in India. It is a union territory, because it is the capital of two states: Punjab and Haryana. As a territory it does not belong to either state. Before 1 November,1966 it was capital of Punjab, but after formation of Haryana on 1 November, 1966 it become a union territory.There are many tourism places in Chandigarh like Rock garden, Rose garden and Sukhna lake."
"Chandigarh came into existence in 1952 when its first stone was laid. It is one of the modern cities of India, designed by a French architect Le Carbusier. It was the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Sh.Jawahar Lal Nehru."
"It is well known for its mixed cultural background and its fast development in the field of Information Technology. It has outlets of many famous multinational companies established here and is emerging as a hub for business development. The territory covers an area of 44 mi² or 114 km², it is bigger than Montserrat but smaller than Jersey. It's also the proposed capital of Khalistan."
Convection
Convection is the movement of heat because of the movement of warm matter.
"For example, atmospheric circulation moves warm air to cool places, causing wind. Wind, in turn, can enter and cool a room if the window is open. The movement of the clouds, the ocean currents and many types of heaters are examples of convection."
Forced convection and natural convection.
"Convection can happen naturally (""natural convection"") or because of a moving device (""forced convection"")."
"The fan is a device that produces the movement of the air artificially. The air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan. This is an example of ""forced convection""."
"Natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold, so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part, the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward. For example, if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire, it moves from the bottom to the surface. At the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom."
Convection currents.
"Convection currents occur when there are significant differences in temperature between two parts of a fluid. When this happens, hot fluids rise and cold fluids sink. This causes movements or currents in the fluid. Atmospheric circulation, for example, is made by convection currents."
Chipmunk
"A chipmunk is a small squirrel-like rodent. It is in the Sciuridae family. About twenty-three species fall under this title, with one species in North America."
"The name may have originally been spelled ""chitmunk"" (perhaps from a Native American word meaning ""red squirrel""). However, the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary (in 1842) as ""chipmonk"". Other early forms include ""chipmuck"" and ""chipminck""."
"Chipmunks are hoarders, meaning they store food for winter."

State ratifying conventions
State ratifying conventions are one of the two ways established by Article Five of the United States Constitution for ratifying proposed constitutional amendments. Ratifying conventions have only been used on one occasion. This was in 1933 and was used to ratify the 21st Amendment. All other proposed constitutional amendments have been offered to the state legislatures for ratification.
"The Constitution also provides that state ratifying conventions may also be used to propose a constitutional amendment. However, to date, none of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by state conventions. A state ratifying convention may be called by a two-thirds vote by a state legislature."

"The show stopped being made in 2012. This was because Sobti, who plays the main character, quit the show. Three years later, in November 2015, a web series of eight episodes was released. It continued the story, and Sobti returned to play Arnav. The web series was successful. Because of its success, the television series was renewed for another 30 episodes. It is to be shown on Star Plus in March 2016."

Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Validated on December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution canceled the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and ended the Prohibition Era in the United States. It is the only Amendment to repeal another amendment. It is also the only Amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures."
Background.
"The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had started a period in the US known as Prohibition. During this time the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement. but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime had soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol. The federal government was unable to enforce the Volstead Act. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time. This was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933, it chose the ""other"" ratification method established by Article V. That is by state conventions."
Implementation.
State and local control.
"The second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages. Many U.S. states still remained ""dry"" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until 1966. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments have tried to revoke liquor licenses."
2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by tsunami waves. It was measured at 8.4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale The earthquake happened off Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, on the east coast of the Tōhoku of Japan, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC. It was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles). It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history. It was also the fourth most powerful earthquake on Earth since modern record-keeping began in 1900."
"On 10 February 2015, the Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing."
Earthquake.
"Days before the main earthquake, there were several foreshocks. The biggest one was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 9 March, about from the main earthquake's location."
The United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was from Tokyo. A 7.7 aftershock happened 30 minutes following the first quake. There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 4.5 or more.
"The earthquake damaged buildings and started fires. The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake. Various train services around Japan were also stopped. Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami, affecting many people. A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara, Chiba prefecture."
"The nuclear power plants shut down automatically. At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked. About 51,000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed. There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown."
Tsunami.
"The earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japan's Pacific coast and other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands (USA) and Taiwan. The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale. It warned that the wave could be as much as 10 meters high. A 0.5 meter high wave hit Japan's northern coast. Kyodo news agency reported a four-metre-high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Miyagi Prefecture was flooded, with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland. In some areas the waves reached 10 km inland."
"At 9:28 p.m (HST) the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7 a.m. for all of Hawaii. Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 2:59 am local time. A wave two meters high reached California, after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500 kilometres per hour. A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave."
Effects.
Deaths–Injured–Missing.
"The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing across 18 prefectures, as well as over 126,000 buildings damaged or destroyed."
Nuclear disaster.
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011, just hours after the initial wave. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped. The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved."
"There were 4.4 million households that had their electricity supply cut off, including 11 nuclear power plants."
Geophysical impact.
"The quake moved parts of northeast Japan as much as closer to North America, making parts of Japan's land ""wider than before,"" according to geophysicist Ross Stein. Areas of Japan closest to the epi-center shifted the most."
"The Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to . Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as , covering an area some long by wide. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake."
"According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass."
"The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude."
Transport.
"The Tōhoku Expressway, which serves northern Japan, had to be closed due to cracks on the roads. The whole railway network was closed, but was reopened hours after the earthquake. Up to 100,000 people were stuck waiting for a ride straight out of the city."
Television broadcast.
"In response to the great disaster, Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast. This was the first time any emperor had used television in this way."
Other help.
"There were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster. For example, Google set up a people finder service, which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people."

"He was 41 when he was shot in the head in the men's room in his University, Divine School where he was teaching on May 21 1991. At times he preached against communism and its system of brainwashing youth. It is alleged that he was killed on the orders of outgoing Romanian Communist Party leaders."
Single (music)
"In popular music marketing, a single is a record release with only one or two songs. The first song (usually the one given the most promotion, and heard more often in the media) is called an A-side, while any other song on the single is called a B-side."
"The pairing of recordings on a single comes from the days of shellac and vinyl records, when discs had two playable sides. Modern compact disc singles may contain more than one version of either the A- or B-side, or sometimes an additional recording by the same performer. B-sides may be selections from an album, or songs not otherwise issued for sale."
"Many times the chance to get a new song issued as an A-side creates competition between members of bands, or teams of songwriters. John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles tried to write better songs than each other, to get more A-sides than the other. George Harrison, also a Beatle, rarely had his songs chosen for singles, but had a hit with ""Something"" for the band."
"In the days of vinyl singles, royalties for both A- and B-sides were paid equally. Many listeners never played B-sides more than once, and radio focused on A-sides. Many people who made recordings knew this, and used it to earn extra money from sales, or to promote other music they made. Phil Spector sometimes used short jam sessions by his studio band as B-sides to singles he produced."
"Michael Nesmith of the Monkees wanted his songs to appear on Monkees singles. He would settle for B-sides, if he could not get an A-side. Don Kirshner, who oversaw the band's early music, wanted the B-sides to come from other songwriters who worked for him. Nesmith and Kirshner disagreed, and it caused tension for the Monkees and their company."
"Records that include more than two or three songs are usually called EPs (for ""extended play""), and may include four or more distinct songs, but not as many as on an album."
Captain America
"Captain America is a fictional superhero from the Marvel Comics. He made his first appearance in the comic book ""Captain America Comics #1"" in 1941""."" He wears a suit that has a white star on his chest with 2 stripes (still white) on each side next to the star. His suit is blue. He also has an indestructible shield with a bullseye and a star on the front of it. He is also known as his alter ego Steve Rogers. Captain America had a sidekick (friend), Bucky who later became the Winter Soldier, is a very good fighter, both hand-to-hand and using his guns to take care of his enemies easily. Captain America has an nemesis called Red Skull. He later joins a team called the Avengers to help protect the world."
Power and abilities.
"Captain America has superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, and can live without eating, sleeping and resting."
Film and TV.
"He first appeared in the serial (film) Captain America, which was from 1940."
"He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Chris Evans. He was in ' (2011), ' (2014) and """" (2016), as well as Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012), and (2015), (2018), and (2019)."
In Real Life.
"In 1966, Joe Simon (one of the people who helped make Captain America) sued Marvel, saying that he was the one who should be able to use the character, not them. It was agreed that Captain America was made under the publisher's rules, and belonged to them. This meant that Marvel won."
Objectivity (journalism)
Objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism. It involves presenting information that can be relied upon.
"Objectivity may have several meanings in the eye of the public. ""Fairness"" involves making sure that multiple sides of an issue are presented. ""Disinterestedness"" means that the presenters are neutral in a story in which the people involved try to influence them. ""Factuality"" bases story content on facts that can be checked by an independent agent. ""Nonpartisanship"" means not taking sides, especially on political matters. Depending on the topic of a story, any or all of these factors may be relevant in the journalist's remaining objective."
"The editorial board of media outlets such as the press or broadcast news chooses what information to present, so the editors' selection may be biased toward one position or belief system."
"In many countries, ""advocacy journalism,"" which supports a particular position, is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism. These stories may be either news or analysis. They may or may not be objective."
Definitions.
"Few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality. However, most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work. In ""Discovering the News"" (1978), sociologist Michael Schudson argues that ""the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts,' a distrust in 'values,' and a commitment to their segregation."" In the United States, an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric."
"Journalism without any bias, as if one just came to Earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced, although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting. (See, for example, Noam Chomsky, The Journalist from Mars.)"

Biography.
"From Mamassan clan, one of the components of the Somali tribe Issas, Ismaïl Omar Guelleh is the grandson of Guellé Mohamed, better known as Guelleh Batal, one of the signatories of the ""agreement franco of August 30, 1917, which ratifies the ""free transfer to the French Government of the coasts, harbors, harbors, islands and territories occupied from time immemorial by the Issa tribes"". In recognition, Guelleh Batal obtained from the French administration the position of recruiter on behalf of the CFE."

"Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, ""Crowded House"", which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits, ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Something So Strong"". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, ""Woodface"" and ""Together Alone"" and the compilation album ""Recurring Dream"", which included the hits ""Fall at Your Feet"", ""Weather with You"", ""Distant Sun"", ""Locked Out"", ""Instinct"" and ""Not the Girl You Think You Are""."
"Founding drummer Hester left in May 1994, citing family reasons, but returned for their ""Farewell to the World"" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester committed suicide, aged 46."
"In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod. They have since released two albums, which have both reached number one on Australia's Album Chart. The new albums are called ""Time on Earth"" (2007) and ""Intriguer"" (2010)."
Amy Klobuchar
"Amy Jean Klobuchar (born May 25, 1960) is an American politician and lawyer. She is the senior United States Senator from Minnesota since 2007. She is a member of the Democratic Party. She is the first elected female senator from Minnesota and the second female senator in the state after Muriel Humphrey Brown."
"She was a lawyer in Minneapolis until being elected county attorney for Hennepin County in 1998, making her responsible for all criminal prosecution in Minnesota's most populous county."
"Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006, becoming Minnesota's first elected female United States Senator, and was reelected in 2012 and 2018. In 2009 and 2010, she was called a ""rising star"" in the Democratic Party. In February 2019, she announced her candidacy for President of the United States in 2020."
Early life.
"Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota. She is the daughter of Rose Katherine (née Heuberger) and James John ""Jim"" Klobuchar, a columnist for the ""Star Tribune""."
"Klobuchar was a valedictorian at Wayzata High School. She received her B.A. degree in political science in 1982 from Yale University. During her time at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for Senator Walter Mondale. Klobuchar received her law degree from the University of Chicago."
Law career.
"Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998, and reelected in 2002. In 2001 ""Minnesota Lawyer"" named her ""Attorney of the Year"". Klobuchar was President of the Minnesota County Attorneys Association from November 2002 to November 2003."
U.S. Senate.
"In early 2005, Senator Mark Dayton announced that he would not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate. She was seen as a favorite for the DFL nomination for the 2006 election. In the general election, Klobuchar faced Republican candidate Mark Kennedy."
"On March 30, 2008, Klobuchar announced her endorsement of Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primary, promising her unpledged superdelegate vote for him."
Klobuchar faced State Representative Kurt Bills and won a second term in the U.S. Senate in 2012.
"In late 2016, Klobuchar was known to have passed more legislation than any other senator. In February 2017, she called for an independent, bipartisan commission like the 9/11 Commission to investigate ties between Russia and U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration. She maintained high approval ratings throughout 2017, with the ""Star Tribune""'s Minnesota Poll announcing in April 2017 that her approval rating was 72%. In October 2017, Morning Consult listed Klobuchar in the Top 10 of their list of senators with the highest approval rating."
One part of getting e-mail addresses is to find addresses that are still in use. One trick used by spammers is to put a link at the end of a message like this:
"If the person clicks on the link, it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address. Then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually open spam messages. Next, the spammers sell that list to other spammers. The same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer (called ""replying""), which also tells the spammer the message has been opened."
Method two.
"Another trick that spammers use is to put a picture – even one that cannot be seen – into a spam message. The picture will have a name that goes with just that one email. When the email is opened, a request will be sent to the server that has that picture to get the image. If they get this request, then they know that you read their email, which could cause a person to receive even more email spam."
Other meanings.
"The word ""spamming"" is also used to describe the act of typing a lot of words or text in Internet chat rooms, so that other people using the chatroom cannot carry on conversations. Usually this blocks the screen with meaningless words, in order to annoy the other people in the chatroom. Spamming in Internet chatrooms is usually considered to be rude. This kind of behavior is usually called ""flooding"" rather than ""spamming""."
"The word ""spam"" is often (mistakenly) applied to emails containing content that the receiver sees as silly or simply meaningless (e.g. yujhcykgfvylfuv,uyguvgy)."
Problems with spam.
"Computer users at home and in workplaces waste a lot of time opening and deleting spam messages. In some cases, spam emails contain viruses or links to pornography or illegal gambling websites. Spam emails often advertise products or services which are being lied about by the companies sending the spam, such as frauds or scams."
Spam prevention.
"Some user email programs can automatically delete spam messages when they arrive, or move them to a separate spam folder. Internet service providers also detect them automatically and cooperate to cut off customers who are major spammers."
Earthquake
"An earthquake is a sudden movement or trembling of the Earth's tectonic plates, that creates shaking of the ground. This shaking can destroy buildings and break the Earth's surface."
"Earthquakes are caused by disturbances in the balance of the earth. The different tectonic plates slowly move past each other. When they get stuck, they build up tension. The earthquake happens when the tectonic plates are suddenly released, so they start to move very quickly. An earthquake's first point of rupture is called its hypocenter, or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter."
"People who study about earthquakes are called seismologists. There can be many earthquakes over a short period of time in a small area. The sudden release of tension in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, repeats, type, and size of earthquakes."
"The effect of an earthquake can be measured by a seismometer. It detects the shakes caused and it puts these movements on a seismograph. The strength, or magnitude, of an earthquake, is measured using the Richter scale. The Richter Scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. On the scale, 2 is scarcely noticeable, and magnitude 5 (or more) creates damage over a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured was a 9.5. An earthquake of 10 has never been recorded."
"Scientists cannot predict an earthquake before it happens. But we do know where earthquakes might happen in the future, like close to fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. This can create just as much destruction as the earthquake itself. Earthquakes can also create landslides."
Zones.
"Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes."
"The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean."
These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension.
History.
Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are quite repeated.
Causes of an earthquake.
"Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes."
"The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this."
"1. Volcanic Earthquakes: Earthquakes which are caused by volcanic eruptions are quite devastating. However, these are confined to areas of active volcanoes."
"2. Collapse Earthquakes: In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes."
Earthquake fault types.
"There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other."
Earthquake clusters.
Summer Palace
"The Summer Palace is a palace in Beijing, China. It is mainly dominated by Longevity Hill (60 meters high) and the Kunming Lake. It covers an expanse of 2.9 square kilometers, three quarters of which is water. The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Between 1750 and 1764 the Qing Emperor Qianlong created the Garden of Clear Ripples (Summer Palace), extending the area of the lake and carrying out other improvements based on the hill and its landscape. During the Second Opium War (1856-60) the garden and its buildings were destroyed by the allied forces. Between 1886 and 1895 it was reconstructed by Emperor Guangxu and renamed the Summer Palace, for use by Empress Dowager Cixi. It was damaged in 1900 by the international expeditionary force during the suppression of the Boxer Rising and 24 years later, it became a public park in 1924."
"There are many buildings in the Summer Palace including The Cloud-Dispelling Hall, the Temple of Buddhist Virtue and the Sea of Wisdom Temple."
Banded stilt
"The banded stilt (""Cladorhynchus leucocephalus"") is a stilt bird from Australia. It is a type of water bird known as a wader."
"The bird gets its name from the red-brown stripe that adults have on their chests. Younger birds do not have them. Its other feathers are pied (black and white) and the eyes are dark brown. The Banded stilt is 35–45 cm tall. It is called the ""Flamingo of Australia"", and the Rottnest snipe on Rottnest Island. However, it is not related to true snipes."
"They spend much of their life looking for food near the ocean in river estuaries and on tidal flats, but they lay eggs in the desert when it rains there. They lay 1-5 eggs at a time. The eggs are white, brown or black eggs. The nests are small holes scraped in the sand or sandy clay. Banded stilts breed on islands created when dry salt lakes fill with water. They come to the lakes to eat the brine shrimp, ""Paratemia"". The eggs of the shrimp can lie in the dry lake beds for many years until the rains fall."
"In 200 years of Europen settlement in Australia, people have only recorded banded stilts laying eggs on 20 occasions. In South Australia, where the stilts are listed as a vulnerable species, they have only bred seven times in the last 70 years. In 2010 there was a huge breeding event at Lake Torrens National Park where more than 150,000 birds gathered as the lake filled for only the second time in 150 years. The eggs and chicks are often eaten by silver gulls. In 2000 when the stilts were breeding on Lake Eyre, nearly all the chicks were eaten."
Brief psychotic disorder
"Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms. This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for only an hour, but it can be any psychotic disorder, such as delusions or hallucinations. Doctors describe three types of BPD. The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress. The second type has no known cause. Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine, morphine or any type of drug. There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder. The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby."
Conduct disorder
"Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder in which a person habitually, deliberately violates the rights of others. They are typically aggressive and threaten to hit people. Habitual stealing is common; some people with CD are sex offenders. They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people, and often enjoy doing so. Many people with CD go on to develop antisocial personality disorder. Everyone who has ASPD previously had CD. The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them attention (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of importance. Some risk factors are heredity, child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent. Anti-psychotic therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic. A high proportion of people who have CD also have other mental disorders, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes the affects of CD worse."
Kodad
Kodad is a town in the Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh in India. The Madhira Institute of Technology and Science has a 40 acre campus about eight kilometres from Kodad.
Hox gene
Hox genes are a group of related genes that determine the basic structure and orientation of animals and plants. 'Hox' is short for 'homeobox'.
"Hox genes are critical for the proper placement of segment structures of animals during early embryonic development (e.g. legs, antennae, and wings in fruit flies or the different vertebrate ribs in humans)."
Hox genes are a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism.
Sequence of hox genes.
"In some organisms, especially vertebrates, the various hox genes are very close to one another on the chromosome in groups or clusters."
The order of the genes on the chromosome is the same as the expression of the genes in the developing embryo. The first gene is expressed in the front of the developing organism. The reason for this co-linearity is not yet completely understood. The diagram above shows the relationship between the genes and protein expression in flies.
Found in all animals and plants.
"The homeodomain protein motif is highly similar in most animals and plants. In addition, homeodomains of individual hox proteins are similar in many species."
"Because of this, it is thought hox gene clusters evolved from a single hox gene via tandem gene duplication. A hox gene cluster with at least seven different hox genes was probably present in the common ancestor of all bilateral animals."
Humans.
"Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch, or simply Alexander Gode (October 30, 1906 – August 10, 1970), was a German-American linguist, and translator. He helped create the auxiliary language Interlingua."
Oceania
"Oceania is a name used in geography for the region made up of Australia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and several other island nations in the surrounding area. It is often listed as one of the continents of the world."
"The term ""Oceania"" does not have one single agreed definition. The widest definition of Oceania includes the entire region between continental Asia and the Americas, including Australasia, as well as islands in the Pacific Rim such as the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, and the Aleutian islands."
"On the other hand, the Oceania ecozone includes all of Micronesia, Fiji, and all of Polynesia except New Zealand. Sometimes, people use the term 'Oceania' to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean, as separate from Australasia. When Oceania is treated separately from Australia, the region of Oceania is referred to as ""Australia and Oceania""."
"In the United Nations' geographic regions, Oceania includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not the Malay Archipelago or Indonesian New Guinea."
"A smaller usage of Oceania as a continent includes only Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and the islands between them. This part of the world is usually called Australasia instead. For these reasons, it is ""not"" correct to say that Australasia is part of Oceania, because what is meant by 'Oceania' is not clear. Australasia has an exact definition in biogeography and geology; Australasia includes New Zealand, Australia (including Tasmania), and Melanesia, New Guinea, and the islands just north and east of Australia. All these are south-east of the Bali–Lombok line, also known as the Wallace Line."
Southern Ocean
"The Southern Ocean is the ocean around Antarctica. It means the waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans around the continent of Antarctica. Since the 1770s geographers have discussed its limits. Nowadays, sixty degrees south latitude is often accepted. Some people call this ocean the Antarctic Ocean."
"The total area is 20,327,000 km², and the coastline length is 17,968 km."
Catalan language
"The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencian Community, the eastern part of Aragon, the Balearic Islands, a small zone of Murcia (all of them in Spain), Andorra, North Catalonia (in France) and the Italian city of L'Alguer. Together, those places are often called the Catalan Countries."
"The language that most similar is Occitan. Catalan also has similarities to other Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese. It came from Vulgar Latin and was first spoken in the in the Eastern Pyrenees in the Middle Ages."
There are about 4 million people who speak Catalan as a first language and about 6 million people as a second language. Catalan is the sixth-most-spoken Romance language and also the most-spoken language that is not an official language in the European Union.
Corset
A corset is a body covering undergarment (clothes worn under others).
It is made in many forms.
Pop music
"Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to. The term ""pop music"" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word ""pop music"" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular. Styles of pop music in the 2020s (today) include rock music, electronic dance music and hip hop. Pop music tends to change quite a lot so the description is quite flexible."
History.
"Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll, (for example Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard) and rockabilly (for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly). In the 1960s, The Beatles became a famous pop music group. In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as funk and soul music. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker."
How does the business of pop music work?
"There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video. These people include the studio staff (people who help the musicians to record CDs and music videos in music studios), production staff (people who help make the music recordings sound good), distribution staff (people who help sell the music to stores) and retail staff (people that sell the music to people at CD stores)."
"Tour staff help the band to travel around the country (or around the world) for their concert tours. Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage. Other tour staff drive buses or cars, so that the band can get to the concert. Some tour staff operate sound equipment, such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify (make louder) the band's music for the audience."
"Promotional staff help to market or promote the band's music, so that more people will know about the band, and buy the band's CDs. Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band's CD to radio station managers or DJs (disk jockeys: the people who announce songs on the radio). Other promotional staff write press releases (short articles) about the band which are sent to the newspapers."
Types of music that became pop music.
"Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s, when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults."
"Croatian nouns are divided into three genders: the masculine, feminine and neuter gender. To know a noun's gender is very important because it affects all the words in a sentence that are tied to the noun, such as adjectives. A gender is determined by the noun's ending (with some exceptions). This makes it easier to tell what gender a noun is without memorizing the gender of every word. See the table below."
"Nouns retain their gender in plural. For instance, even though the noun 'žene' (women) ends in -e, it is of the feminine gender."
Grammatical aspects.
"Croatian verbs have two grammatical aspects: the perfective and imperfective. The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished. The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still continuing. So, each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways: in its perfective and imperfective aspect. The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects."
Grammatical tenses.
"In Croatian, there are seven grammatical tenses. They can be divided in two ways: by the time they take place in and by their complexity. Simple tenses consist of only 1 word (simple tenses are aorist, imperfect, and present) while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words (complex tenses are pluperfect, perfect, first future, second future) because they also consist of auxiliary verbs. Also, some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects, they work with only one aspect."
Common phrases.
"The Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday, unlike weeks from some other countries, where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last."
Prize
A prize is an award given to a person or a group of people to reward good work.
"Official prizes often include monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are given out in famous ceremonies, such as the Oscars."
"Prizes are given for a number of reasons: as an honour for special persons, for exemplary behaviour and to provide incentives in competitions, etc. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy."
Specific types of prizes include:
Christian Church
"The term Christian Church, Catholic Church or One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as it was called by 110 AD, refers to the ""universal company of believers"". It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith. The idea is that all these people together make up one ""body"" called ""the Church"". ""The Church"" (in this sense) is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation. It is thought of as being part of God's way to bring people close to him. ""The Church"" was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD. It is called ""The Christian Church"" because Jesus was called ""The Christ"" (or holy one from God)."
"Today there are many churches in the sense of ""church organisations"". The different organised churches are called Christian denominations."
"The main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations. These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a ""statement of faith"" which is called the Creed. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the ""creator and eternal father of all things"", that Jesus was the ""Christ"" and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins, and that the Holy Spirit is God's gift to help and comfort Christian people. Christians believe that these are three parts of One God."
There are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations. These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations. The different opinions are called controversies.
"During Late Antiquity, the Christian Church started became the most important persecuting organization in human history."
Terminology.
"The English word ""church"" comes from the Greek κυριακή (kyriake) meaning ""Master's (house)"", or ""Lord's (house)"". In modern English the word ""church"" is used for both a church building and ""the Christian Church"" throughout the world."
"In 381 AD, at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople, the Nicene Creed (a statement of beliefs) that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church. The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are ""One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church"". This important addition describes the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church."
These are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed:
Controversies.
"One important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church. To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words ""One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church"" which means ""universal"" church. Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world-wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the ""common faith"" and not a common organisation or tradition. (""Common faith"" means ""the faith that is the same"". The word ""common"" does not mean ""ordinary"" in this sense.)"
"For many hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the ""Catholic"" (or ""universal"") church. In other words, only those people who were within the ""organisation"" of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the ""Universal Church"". In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations. The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way, but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. Some smaller denominations such as Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church."
Church (disambiguation)
Church could mean:
Charles Darwin's books
"Charles Darwin wrote about twenty books, including the most famous book in biology, the ""Origin of Species"". The books covered the natural history sciences, now called geology, palaeontology, zoology, botany, anthropology, psychology and evolutionary biology."
"The ""Origin of Species"" is the most important single book in the biological sciences, and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research."
"""The Voyage of the Beagle"" (1839) and ""The Descent of Man"" (1871) are also highly important."
Several of the other books were also ground-breaking.
Penelope Ann Miller
"Penelope Ann Miller (born Penelope Andrea Miller, January 13, 1964) is an American stage and movie actress. She has acted in numerous movies and television programs. Her father Mark Miller was an actor."
"She was born in Los Angeles, California on January 13, 1964. She has been married to Will Arnett from 1994 until they divorced in 1995. She is now married to James Huggins since 2000. With Miller she has two children."
Order of the Companions of Honour
"The Order of the Companions of Honour is a British award given to citizens of the Commonwealth. It was founded by King George V in 1917, as a reward for outstanding achievements in the arts, literature, music, science, politics, industry or religion."
"The order is limited to 65 ""Companions of Honour"". At first 45 members could be from the United Kingdom, 7 from Australia, 2 from New Zealand and 11 from other Commonwealth countries. Foreigners from outside the realm may be added as ""honorary members"". Membership of the order gives no title, or precedence, but recipients can put the post-nominal letters ""CH"" after their names."
"The insignia of the Order consists of an oval medallion with an oak tree, a shield with the royal arms hanging from one branch, and on the left a mounted knight in armour. The badge's clear blue border bears the motto ""IN ACTION FAITHFUL AND IN HONOUR CLEAR"". Men wear the badge on a ribbon (red with golden border threads) around their necks, and women on a bow at the left shoulder."
Culture jamming
"Culture jamming is a tactic by consumer social movements to either disrupt or subvert mainstream cultural institutions. It is also intended to expose dubious or substandard political thoughts on commercial culture. The tactics of culture jamming include refiguring fashion statements, product image and logos as means to challenge ideas about what is cool."
"The term ""culture jamming"" was first used around 1984."
Orchestra
"An orchestra is a group of musicians playing instruments together. They make music. A large orchestra is sometimes called a ""symphony orchestra"" and a small orchestra is called a ""chamber orchestra"". A symphony orchestra may have about 100 players, while a chamber orchestra may have 30 or 40 players. The number of players will depend on what music they are playing and the size of the place where they are playing. The word ""orchestra"" originally meant the semi-circular space in front of a stage in a Greek theatre which is where the singers and instruments used to play. Gradually the word came to mean the musicians themselves."
The conductor.
"The orchestra is directed by a conductor. He/she helps the players to play together, to get the right balance so that everything can be heard clearly, and to encourage the orchestra to play with the same kind of feeling. Some small chamber orchestras may play without a conductor. This was usual until the 19th century when the orchestras got very big and needed a conductor who made decisions and stood in front so that all the players could see him."
The instruments.
"The instruments of the orchestra are divided into districts: the strings, woodwind, brass and percussion. Each section (group of instruments) will have a player who is the ""Boss"". The principals will make decisions about seating arrangements, and about technical ways of playing the music: for example the principal of the string sections will make sure all the players move their bows up and down in the same direction. The violins are divided into first and second violins. The first violins usually have the tune while the seconds, most of the time, are part of the accompaniment. The principal of the first violin is the leader (or concertmaster) of the orchestra. In a professional orchestra they will be the most highly paid member of the orchestra."
The string family.
"The strings are the biggest section, although there are only five kinds of instruments: violin, viola, cello, double bass, and harp. This is because they are playing most of the time and usually form the basis of the music. If they are not playing the tune they will probably be accompanying. The first and second violins play different notes: the firsts usually have the tune. The strings sit at the front of the stage in a fan-shape in front of the conductor. The first violins are on the conductor's left, then come the second violins, then the violas and then the cellos. The double basses are behind the cellos. Some conductors prefer to have the second violins on their right and the cellos between the first violins and violas (see image of the Dohnanyi Orchestra)."
The woodwind family.
"The woodwind sit in one or two rows (depending on the size of the orchestra) behind the strings. There are five main woodwind instruments: flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon. Each of these instruments also come in different versions:"
"The flute has a small version called the piccolo which plays an octave higher. It is the highest instrument in the orchestra. Occasionally there is an alto flute which is longer and plays a fifth (half an octave) lower than the flute. Most woodwind instruments need a reed, but the flute does not have a reed."
The bassoon has a larger version: the contrabassoon or double bassoon which sounds an octave lower. It is one of the lowest instruments in the orchestra.
"The clarinet has a larger version as well; the bass clarinet. It reaches the same depth as a bassoon. Usually only one is found in a modern orchestra. There is also an alto clarinet but because it plays the same part an alto saxophone plays, it is typically regarded as an unnecessary instrument."
"Fasting is a kind of abstinence. It is when someone does not eat or drink for some specified period of time. It is only the case if the person does so of his or her own will. It may also be that the person only eats and drinks certain kinds of food. Most often, fasting is done for religious reasons. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid sexual intercourse, (or any sexual desire), masturbation, as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. meat)."
"Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the Qur'an, in the Mahabharata, in the Upanishads, and in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testament. In Buddhism it is also taught as a way to getting Nirvana."
"In almost all cases, there are exceptions for observing the fasting. These are made for the following groups of people"
Politics.
Fasting as a form of protest is called a hunger strike.
Intermittent fasting.
Timed fasting is known as Intermittent fasting.
There are different ways to time your fast. You can:
Walpurgis Night
"Walpurgis Night (""Valborgsmässoafton"" in Swedish, ""Vappu"" in Finnish, ""Volbriöö"" in Estonian, ""Valpurģu nakts"" or ""Valpurģi"" in Latvian, ""Walpurgisnacht"" in German), ""Čarodějnice"" in Czech is a holiday celebrated on April 30 or May 1, in Finland, Sweden, Bohemia (Czech Republic), Estonia, Latvia and Germany."
Origins.
"The festival is named after Saint Walburga (known in Scandinavia as ""Valborg""; alternative forms are ""Walpurgis"", ""Wealdburg"", or ""Valderburger""), born in Wessex in 710 a niece of Saint Boniface. According to legend, she was a daughter to the Saxon prince St. Richard. Together with her brothers she travelled to Württemberg, Germany where she became a nun and lived in the convent of Heidenheim, which was founded by her brother Wunibald. Walburga died on 25 February 779 and that day still carries her name in the Catholic calendar. However she was not made a saint until 1 May in the same year, and that day carries her name in the Swedish calendar."
"Historically the Walpurgisnacht is derived from Pagan spring customs, where the arrival of spring was celebrated with bonfires at night. Viking fertility celebrations took place around April 30 and due to Walburga being declared a saint at that time of year, her name became associated with the celebrations. Walburga was worshipped in the same way that Vikings had celebrated spring and as they spread throughout Europe, the two dates became mixed together and created the Walpurgis Night celebration."
Germany.
"In Germany, Walpurgisnacht, the night from April 30 to May 1, is the night when allegedly the witches hold a large celebration on the Blocksberg and await the arrival of Spring. When the travel to that mountain is too far, they may also chose another hill in the region they live."
"""Walpurgis Night (in German folklore) the night of April 30 (May Day's eve), when witches meet on the Brocken mountain and hold revels with their Gods..."""
"""Brocken the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany. It is noted for the phenomenon of the Brocken spectre and for witches' revels which reputably took place there on Walpurgis night."
"The Brocken Spectre is a magnified shadow of an observer, typically surrounded by rainbow-like bands, thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low. The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken."""

Avian influenza
"Avian influenza (bird flu, or grippe of the birds), is an illness caused by a virus. The virus, called ""influenza A"" or ""type A"", usually lives in birds. Sometimes it infects mammals, including humans."
"There are many types of influenza A, which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878. Most types have weak symptoms, such as breathing problems, similar to the common cold."
"But some types kill birds, and a few kill humans and other mammals. One type of bird flu, called ""Spanish flu"", killed 50 to 100 million people in 1918/1920. Another type, called ""Asian Flu"" killed one million in 1957, and another one, called ""Hong Kong Flu"", also killed one million people in 1968."
"A subtype, called ""H5N1"", killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but did not kill again until 2003, this time in China. Until the middle of 2005, it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe. It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread. So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans. The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate. It might create a human flu pandemic. Governments around the world are spending money to deal with this problem: studying H5N1, creating vaccines, conducting pandemic practice exercises, stockpiling useful flu medication, and many other activities."
Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy
"The ""Jyllands-Posten"" Muhammad cartoons controversy is a controversy about a series of cartoons. They were first published in a Danish newspaper. The publication led to an outcry, and sparked violent protests in the Islamic world, with many people dying. The cartoons were drawn and created by Kurt Westergaard."
"The crisis began after cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad were published in the Danish newspaper ""Jyllands-Posten"" on September 30, 2005. Danish Muslim organizations staged protests in response. As the controversy has grown, some or all of the cartoons have been reprinted in newspapers in more than fifty other countries. The protests got worse when fake cartoons were released."
"One of the cartoons showed Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. Some people thought this was saying that all Muslims are terrorists. But other cartoons made fun of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. One insulted the editors of the newspaper, by using the language Farsi."
"Critics claims that the cartoons are culturally insulting, Islamophobic, blasphemous, and intended to humiliate a ""marginalized"" minority. However, supporters of the cartoons claim they illustrate an important issue and their publication exercises the right of free speech. They have also claimed that similar cartoons are made relative to other religions, arguing that Islam and its followers have not been targeted in a discriminatory way."
Section 3: Senate.
Clause 1: Composition; Election of Senators.
"The first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two Senators. It states they would be elected by its state legislature and serve six-year terms. Each Senator has one vote. By these provisions, the framers of the Constitution intended to protect the interests of the states as states. However, this clause has been superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913. Due to problems in the Senate, it was changed to Senators would now be elected by the people instead of the state legislatures."
Clause 2: Classification of Senators; Vacancies.
"Approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. But the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year. The Seventeenth Amendment changed how vacancies would be filled. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held."
Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators.
"A Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State he or she will represent at the time of the election. As with Representatives in the House, the Constitution sets the qualifications to be a Senator."
Clause 4: Vice President as President of Senate.
"Section Three provides that the Vice President is the President of the Senate. When serving in this capacity, the Vice President, who is not a member of the Senate, may cast a vote to break a tie. Early in the nation's history, Vice Presidents frequently presided over the Senate. In modern times, the Vice President usually does so only during ceremonial occasions or when a tie in the voting is anticipated. A tie-breaking vote has been cast 243 times by 35 different Vice Presidents."
Clause 5: President pro tempore and other officers.
"Clause five provides for a President ""pro tempore of the Senate"" (meaning temporary), a Senator elected to the post by the Senate, to preside over the body when the Vice President is either absent or exercising the Office of the President."
"The Senate's current practice is to elect a full-time President pro tempore at the beginning of each Congress, as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the Vice President's absence. Since World War II, the senior (longest serving) member of the majority party has filled this position. As is true of the Speaker of the House, the Constitution does not require that the President pro tempore be a senator, but by tradition, a senator is always chosen."
Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment.
"The House of Representatives votes to impeach a president, vice president or other civil officer, but the Senate serves as judge and jury. The defendant in the trial can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Only three times has the Senate brought impeachment charges against a president still in office. This was in 1868 against Andrew Johnson, in 1998 against Bill Clinton, and in 2020 against Donald Trump. In each case, the president was not convicted and allowed to serve out his term of office."
Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction.
"If any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office. He or she may be barred from holding any public office in the future. No other punishments may be used. Any person removed from office may still be criminally prosecuted. They may also be subject to lawsuits."
Section 4: Congressional elections.
"Clause 1: Time, place, and manner of holding."
"State legislatures have the task of deciding how congressional elections are held. They may decide the scheduling of an election, where voters may cast ballots and how voters are to register. Congress has the right to change these rules."
Clause 2: Sessions of Congress.
"Clause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution gives Congress the power to meet, whether or not the President called it into session."
Section 5: Procedure.
Clause 1: Qualifications of Members.
"Section Five states that a majority of each House constitutes a quorum to do business; a smaller number may adjourn the House or compel the attendance of absent members. In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call, requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic."
Clause 2: Rules.
"Each House can determine its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members. A two-thirds vote is necessary to expel a member. Section 5, Clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each House regarding when and how each House may change its rules, leaving details to the respective chambers."
Clause 3: Record of proceedings.
"Each House must keep and publish a Journal, though it may choose to keep any part of the Journal secret. The decisions of the House—not the words spoken during debates—are recorded in the Journal; if one-fifth of those present (assuming a quorum is present) request it, the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered."
Clause 4: Adjournment.
"Neither House may adjourn, without the consent of the other, for more than three days. Often, a House will hold ""pro forma"" sessions every three days. Such sessions are held just to fulfill the constitutional requirement. They are not for the purpose of conducting business. Neither House may meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses (the Capitol), without the consent of the other House."
"Section 6: Compensation, privileges, and restrictions on holding civil office."
Clause 1: Compensation and legal protection.
Sally Yates
"Sally Caroline Quillian Yates (born August 20, 1960 in Atlanta) is an American lawyer. She studied at the University of Georgia and was the acting Attorney General of the United States from January 20, 2017 through January 30, 2017. She was also serving as Deputy Attorney General from March 2015 until her dismissal on January 30, 2017."
Early life and education.
"Yates was born in Atlanta to John Kelley Quillian (1930–1986), an attorney and judge who was a judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals between 1966 and 1984, and his wife, Xara ""Mickey"" DeBeaugrine Quillian (née Terrell; 1931–2012), an interior designer. Her grandmother had been one of the first women admitted to the Georgia Bar; however, she was not hired as an attorney, instead working as a legal secretary for Yates's grandfather."
"Yates attended the University of Georgia, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1982. In 1986, she earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Georgia School of Law, graduating magna cum laude. While in law school, Yates was the executive editor of the ""Georgia Law Review""."
Dismissal as Acting Attorney General.
"On January 30, 2017, President Donald Trump fired her after saying she won't defend his executive order on the immigration ban."
Sally Yates explained her decision not to defend the executive order in the following letter to the DOJ employees:
"""On January 27, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order regarding immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries. The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions."""
"""My role is different from that of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which, through administrations of both parties, has reviewed Executive Orders for form and legality before they are issued. OLC’s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC’s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted. Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order’s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just."""
"""Similarly, in litigation, DOJ Civil Division lawyers are charged with advancing reasonable legal arguments that can be made supporting an Executive Order. But my role as leader of this institution is different and broader. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful."""
"""Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so."""
2015 Confirmation Hearing.
"A career prosecutor in Atlanta who has served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, Sally Yates has been hailed as a hero by both parties. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, introduced her at her confirmation hearing in 2015."
"“She will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what’s right,” Mr. Isakson said at the time. “She’ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just.”"
"At those hearings, Republicans were furious about former President Barack Obama's order liberalizing immigration policy and questioned Ms. Yates about whether she would be willing to stand up to the president. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, was particularly pointed in his questioning."
"“If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say 'No?’” Mr. Sessions asked."
"""I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,” Ms. Yates replied."
Sylvia Mathews Burwell
"Sylvia Mathews Burwell was born June 23, 1965 and served as the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2014 to 2017. Previously she was the Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2013 to 2014."
"She was nominated by President Barack Obama on April 11, 2014, to the position of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services after Kathleen Sebelius resigned. Burwell's nomination was confirmed by the Senate on June 5, 2014 by a vote of 78-17."
Simone Veil
"Simone Veil, DBE (; 13 July 1927 – 30 June 2017) was a French lawyer and politician. She served as Minister of Health under Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, President of the European Parliament and member of the Constitutional Council of France."
She was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion D'Honneur in 2012.
She was of Jewish descent and survived the Holocaust.
"Veil died in Paris on 30 June 2017, aged 89."
United States Deputy Attorney General
The United States Deputy Attorney General is the second highest ranking official in the United States Department of Justice. The Deputy Attorney General manages the day-to-day activities of the Department of Justice. It may act as Attorney General during the absence of the Attorney General. President of the United States appoints the Deputy Attorney General with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General was created in 1950.
Radio
"Radio is a way to send electromagnetic signals over a long distance, to deliver information from one place to another. A machine that sends radio waves is called a transmitter, while a machine that ""picks up"" the signals is called a receiver or antenna. A machine that does both jobs is a ""transceiver"". When radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a broadcast."
Television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound.
Airplanes and other things may be used under radio control. Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance.
"Sound can be sent by radio, sometimes through Frequency Modulation (FM) or Amplitude Modulation (AM)."
History of radio.
"Many people worked to make radio possible. After James Clerk Maxwell predicted them, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in Germany first showed that radio waves exist. Guglielmo Marconi in Italy made radio into a practical tool of telegraphy, used mainly by ships at sea. He is sometimes said to have invented radio. Later inventors learned to transmit voices, which led to broadcasting of news, music and entertainment."
Uses of radio.
"Radio was first created as a way to send telegraph messages between two people without wires. Then two-way radio brought voice communication, including walkie-talkies and eventually mobile phones."
"Now an important use is to broadcast music, news and entertainers including ""talk radio"". Radio shows were used before there were TV programs. In the 1930s the US president started sending a message about the country every week to the American people. Companies that make and send radio programming are called radio stations. These are sometimes run by governments, and sometimes by private companies, who make money by sending advertisements. Other radio stations are supported by local communities. These are called community radio stations. In the early days manufacturing companies would pay to broadcast complete stories on the radio. These were often plays or dramas. Because companies who made soap often paid for them, these were called ""soap operas""."
"Radio waves are still used to send messages between people. Talking to someone with a radio is different than ""talk radio"". Citizens band radio and amateur radio use specific radios to talk back and forth. Policemen, firemen and other people who help in emergency use a radio emergency communication system to communicate (talk to each other). It is like a mobile phone, (which also uses radio signals) but the distance they reach is shorter and both people must use the same kind of radio."
"The word ""radio"" is sometimes used to mean only voiceband broadcasting. Most voiceband broadcasting uses lower frequency and longer wavelength than most television broadcasting."
"Microwaves have even higher frequency; shorter wavelength. They also are used to transmit television and radio programs, and for other purposes. Communications satellites relay microwaves around the world."
"A radio receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. Low frequency radio waves can bend around hills by diffraction, although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals."
"Shortwave radio frequencies are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere. The waves can bounce between the ionosphere and the earth to reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface. They can reach very far, sometimes around the world."
"Radio telescopes receive radio waves from the sky to study astronomical objects. Satellite navigation uses radio to determine location, and radar uses it to find and track things."
Vandalism
Vandalism is a crime that is done by destroying or damaging the property of someone else. This can include graffiti and website damage.
"A person that does this is called a vandal. The name comes from the Vandals, a tribe that attacked and damaged the city of Rome in 455 CE."
Examples.
"Many websites, such as wikis (like Wikipedia), forums, and blogs, can be changed by anyone. Because of this, they can be ""vandalized"" by adding comments or replacing everything on the page with spam, nonsense or other silly content. It is a kind of trolling, and these websites have special users, called administrators, whose job is to remove the vandalism and to block users who do not stop vandalizing."
"Examples of physical vandalism include salting lawns, cutting trees without permission, egg throwing, breaking windows, arson, spraying paint on others' properties, tagging,"
Monopoly (game)
"Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players. In the game, players move around the spaces of the board, buying and selling land and buildings to try to become the richest player. When all the other players run out of money, you win the game."
"Many books give advice on how to win the game. An early book, ""1000 Ways to Win Monopoly Games"" was written by Jeffrey S. Lehman (who later became President of Cornell University) and Jay S. Walker (founder of priceline.com.)"
History.
"""Monopoly"" was created by Elizabeth Magie as a teaching tool based on the economic concept of land monopoly. Magie created the game in 1903, to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. She wanted her game to be an educational tool to highlight the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. Her game, which she called ""The Landlord's Game"", was self-published, beginning in 1906. The original rules included several ways to play the game, including one where players could agree to share the land rents and everyone would win."
"In 1934, Charles Darrow in Philadelphia found The Landlord's Game and thought that the game was more exciting when players didn't share their land rents. He published his own version of the game where making money was the focus of the game, and called it ""Monopoly."" Later on, he sold his game to Parker Brothers, who falsely credited Charles Darrow as the creator of the game."
The Board.
Manic Street Preachers
"Manic Street Preachers (often referred to as the Manics) are an alternative rock band from Blackwood, Wales, formed in 1986. They are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Their biggest success was during the 1990s."
"The band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead."
"The Manics released their debut album ""Generation Terrorists"" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken"
"invective and songs about ""culture, alienation, boredom and despair"" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words ""4 REAL"" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's ""The Holy Bible"" showed the result of Edwards' instability."
"Following Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire kept with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success. They became one of Britain's top rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album ""This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours"" and the singles ""If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"" (1998) and ""The Masses Against The Classes"" (2000). They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, ""Journal For Plague Lovers"", was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance."
"In 2010 their tenth album ""Postcards from a Young Man"" was released. Their eleventh album ""Rewind the Film"" was released on 16 September 2013. Their next album ""Futurology"" is going to be released in 2014."
Turnstile
"A turnstile, also called a baffle gate, is a type of gate. It only allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to make one-way traffic of people. It can also make passage only to people who put in a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. A turnstile can be used for paid access (sometimes called a faregate when used for this). For example, it can be used in public transport as a ticket barrier or at a pay toilet."
"Turnstiles are used at a variety of places. This includes stadiums, amusement parks, museums, and mass transit stations."
Toroid (geometry)
"A toroid is a geometric shape that resembles a torus. A toroid is constructed by rotating a geometrical shape around an axis which is outside the shape. If this is done to a circle, a torus results."
Ashburys railway station
"Ashburys railway station in Openshaw serves Beswick and West Gorton in Manchester, England. It is located on the Manchester-Glossop Line at its junction with the branch line to and and the freight-only line to Phillips Park Junction (on the Huddersfield Line)."
Regional casino
"A Regional Casino, more commonly known as a Super Casino (or occasionally known as Mega Casino), is the term given to the largest category of casino that was to have been permitted under UK law. It is meant to be the same size as the larger casinos in Las Vegas. The first Regional Casino was proposed to be in the City of Manchester. This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom."
History.
"The Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England. Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of 'destination casinos' in the style of Las Vegas, commonly referred to in the media as 'Super Casinos'"
"Initial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size, referred to as a 'Regional Casino', with a further eight 'large' and eight 'small' casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits."
"Prior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK, the largest of which in Star City, Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres. Customers were required to register twenty-four hours prior to gaming."
Definition of casino types.
"Under the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino, with reference to any matter he or she chooses; although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number, location and concentration of gaming tables, and the floor area designated for a specific purpose."
Definitions have been determined such that the 'super casino' will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited-jackpot slot machines.
'Large casinos' will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of £4000.
"The 'small casinos' will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres, up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of £4000."
The shortlist.
"In May 2006, a short-list of eight sites, selected from various ones submitted by local councils, was announced for the location of the Regional Casino. These were:"
"On 30 January 2007 it was announced that the first Regional Casino would be built in East Manchester near the City of Manchester Stadium. This was a shock to the Blackpool and The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome) bids. Both of them were thought of as the favourites. However, the Blackpool bid organisers pledged to continue the work in getting government approval for a 'supercasino'."
"It is a good idea to adopt a cat from a vet or an animal shelter. The vet, shelter or RSPCA will make sure they are healthy and spayed."
"Kittens are sometimes born with defects. People who receive cats as gifts are recommended to get it examined for its health. Some birth defects need attention. Others are harmless, like polydactyly. Polydactyly means many digits, or many ""fingers"" from poly (many) and dactyl (digit). Sometimes, there is a mutation (change) in cat families. Most cats have only four to five toes per paw, depending on whether it is the front or back paw. These mutated cats have six, seven, and in rare cases even more. All of these cats are called ""polydactyl cats"". They can also be called ""Hemingway cats"" because author Ernest Hemingway owned some of these cats."
Engineering
Engineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering at a college or university. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use their skills to solve technical problems. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been creating and engineering things for thousands of years.
Specialties.
Engineering is a big subject. Here are a few of the many types of engineers:
"Engineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people. Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed."
Study.
Most (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves working within a limited budget and materials.
American courses.
"In the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their specialty."
British courses.
"In the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD). Engineers of all disciplines have common approaches to solving problems including teamwork, communication, and an Iterative design process."
"Engineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions."
French courses.
"The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Préparatoire pour les Grandes Écoles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an ""École d'Ingénieur"" (Engineer's school)."
"You can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an ""École d'Ingénieur""."
Communication
Communication is when information is passed from a sender to a recipient using a medium. There are different media that can be used:
"Communication can be spoken (a word) or non-spoken (a smile). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture."
Communication that tries to change somebody's mind may be called persuasion or propaganda.
How communication works.
Communication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms
"Besides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its context"
"For a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary that avoids ambiguity. For example, the word ""hedge"" can mean completely different things based on the context. In botany a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border. In finance, a hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of another investment. In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without information it is therefore very difficult to know which ""hedge"" is really meant by the speaker."
Miracle
"A Miracle is an amazing, beneficial event that goes (or at least seems to go) against natural laws. Some people say that a miracle is always an act brought about by God or other supernatural force (such as an angel). Others say that there can always be another explanation for it. And thirdly, some say the event is myth and never actually even happened in the first place."
According to the Bible.
"In the Bible a miracle is an act by God, where God's presence is shown. They can be an act that affects one person, or a gigantic disturbance of nature that changes the world."
"Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar [under pseudonym L. von Südland] The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. This racist work was reprinted in 1990. In the preface to this reprint edition, Dr. Vladimir Veselica, a Zagreb University professor, expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given ""relevant answers"" at the highest intellectual level. What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs. It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book, which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs: "" it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition, how a bent for conspiracies, revolutions and coups is in their blood."""
Oligosaccharide
"An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars. Oligosacchardides are carbohydrates. When they are hydrolized, oligosaccharides give 3 to 10 monosaccharides."
"Oligosacharides are formed when 3 to 10 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 3 to 10 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides."
Think tank
"A think tank is a special organization which helps other organizations and groups with problems they do not know how to solve. They do this by providing data or knowledge, and by discussing the options in detail. They get their information by doing research, and by collecting ideas and data from a wide range of sources."
Origins.
"The first think tank was the British Royal United Services Institute (1831), though of course the term ""think tank"" is much later, post World War II. Non-government institutions in the United States started early in the 20th century. The Arthur D. Little consultancy, incorporated in 1909, pioneered the idea of contracted professional services. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was founded in 1910. The Institute for Government Research, which later merged into the Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution (1919), and Chatham House in London (1920). The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934) and the Committee for Economic Development (1943)."
The cold war era.
"Think tanks of the modern kind started after the Second World War, in the cold war era. The RAND Corporation was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company, and was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&amp;D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. The RAND used the same operations research (O.R.) methods which scientists had developed during the war. This was the application of knowledge, scientific methods and thinking to solve the new problems posed by the war. After the war, the RAND used very similar techniques, mostly based on the hard sciences like maths, physics and economics. It was and still is funded mainly by the American government."
"The cold war period raised the question of how the American government might handle nuclear weapons in bargaining and negotiating with the Soviet Union. This was the speciality of Herman Kahn, a RAND staff member who set up his own think tank in 1961, called the Hudson Institute. His publications on how to think about these issues, and those of Thomas Schelling, were landmarks in the post-war history of negotiating strategy."
Modern period.
"More recently, think tanks have specialised into particular areas of interest, such as foreign policy. Many have become advocates for political interests, doing research which can be used by public relations and lobbying groups."
Solar calendar
"A solar calendar shows the earth's position compared to the sun. There are tropical solar calendars, sidereal solar calendars, non-solar calendars (like lunar - moon - calendars), and lunisolar calendars."
Major League Baseball on FOX
"Fox Major League Baseball (shortened as Fox MLB and MLB on FS1) is FOX Sports's broadcast of Major League Baseball. It began on June 1, 1996 and continue through at least 2021."
Early Years: 1996-2000.
"Major League Baseball made a deal with FOX and NBC on November 7, 1995. FOX televised regular season games (about 16 weekly telecasts normally beginning on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons, selected Division Series games, and alternated the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series with NBC each year. To better state this, FOX aired the All-Star Game aired American League Championship Series in odd-numbered years while airing the National League Championship Series and World Series in even-numbered years."
Exclusivity: 2001-2006.
"In September 2000, Major League Baseball and FOX signed a 6-year contract to air Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games, and exclusive coverage of the League Championship Series and the World Series."
New Contract: 2007-2021.
"Rumors about the end of ""Major League Baseball on FOX"" were laid to rest on July 11, 2006 when the network announced they would still air the World Series through the 2013 season. It was announced on October 17, 2006 that FOX would retain the All-Star Game and World Series, except they would air the regular season beginning with the first Saturday of the regular season, and postseason coverage beyond the World Series was limited to one League Championship Series a year, alternating one for the other with TBS each year, airing the other LCS."
National League Championship Series
"In Major League Baseball, the National League Championship Series (NLCS), played in October, is a playoff round that decides the winner of the National League pennant. The winner of the series moves on to play the winner of the American League Championship Series in baseball's championship, the World Series."
History.
"In 1969, the LCS began play as the leagues were expanded to two divisions. Initially, it was a best-of-five series. In 1985, it became best-of-seven. Since 1995, the two winners from the National League Division Series advance to the NLCS."
"Manama, Bahrain's capital city, is as modern as other cities in the world. But life in the island's many villages (and in parts of Manama itself) remains traditional. Where there is tradition in the Persian Gulf area, there is Islamic conservatism: women cover themselves from head to foot and women travellers are expected to wear long skirts and one-piece bathing suits. Bahrain's population is 85% Muslim and Islam is the state religion. Arabic is the official language, but many people speak English."
"Traditional folk art continues in several places around Bahrain: dhows (fishing boats) are built near Manama and Muharraq, cloth is made at Bani Jamrah and pottery is made at A'ali. A few goldsmiths still work in the Manama souk, though much of the work is now done in other countries. One of the important parts of Bahraini culture is the drinking of traditional Arabian coffee. Traditional Arabian street food like shawarma (lamb or chicken cut from a large spit and served in pita bread) and desserts such as baklava are also found."
Formula One.
"Bahrain is the home of Formula One racing in the Middle East, hosting the Bahrain Grand Prix."
William Christopher
"William Christopher (October 20, 1932 – December 31, 2016) was an American actor. He was best known for playing Father Mulcahy on the television series ""M*A*S*H"". He also played Private Lester Hummel on ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."""
"Christopher was born in Evanston, Illinois. He studied at Wesleyan University. His wife was Barbara O'Connor; together they wrote a book, ""Mixed Blessings"", about their experiences raising their autistic son. He retired in 2012."
"Christopher died on December 31, 2016 in Pasadena, California from small-cell carcinoma, aged 84."
Boxer shorts
"Boxer shorts are men's underwear. They are shorts with a stretchy band, and named after the shorts worn by boxers."
"They were first made in the 1930s, but did not become popular until 1947. These days, briefs (Y-fronts) are sold more than boxer shorts."
Some boxer shorts have openings with a snap button for using the toilet (urinating). Others just have an elastic waistband and can be pulled on or off like briefs. They can be made in different colors or patterns. Television displays more men in boxer shorts than in other underwear.
Compact disc player
A CD player is a device that can read the binary data on a CD (compact disc) and turn that into sound waves.
"A CD player has a laser and an optical sensor. A CD has tracks and bumps on the tracks. The CD player passes a laser beam along the track of the CD. The areas that are reflected (without the bumps) are 1s to the player and the areas that are reflected (with the bumps) are 0s to the player. When the 1's and 0's are added to the CD a complicated coding is used that enables error corrections to prevent the CD ""skipping"" in the event of a small scratch. The CD player converts the series of 1's and 0's into sound waves by sending a varying voltage into an amplifier which then drives a speaker. The conversion of digital data into an analogue signal is achieved through the use a matrix(maths not the movie), imaginary numbers and trigonometric functions."
Fluid dynamics
"Fluid Dynamics talks about how fluids (liquids and gases) work. It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics, and is studied by physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations. The fluid dynamics of gases are called aerodynamics."
"Understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents. For example, fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather, because clouds and air are both fluids. Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water."
"Computer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids. Computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much, and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer. Studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics (or CFD for short)."
Important equations in fluid dynamics.
The mathematical equations that govern fluid flow are simple to think about but very hard to solve. In most real life cases there is no way to get a solution that can be written down and a computer must be used to calculate the answer instead. There are three fundamental equations based on three rules.
"Conservation of mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed, it simply moves from one place to another. This gives the mass conservation equation. Sometimes this may not apply such as a flow involving a chemical reaction."
"Conservation of energy: this is the first law of thermodynamics, energy is never created or destroyed, it just changes form (i.e. kinetic energy into potential energy) or moves around."
"Conservation of momentum: this is Newton's Second Law and it states that Force = rate of change of momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity. The momentum equations are the equations that make it hard to solve problems in fluid dynamics. There are a number of different versions that include a number of different effects. The Navier-Stokes equations are momentum equations, and the Euler equations are the Navier-Stokes equations but with viscosity not included. There is one momentum equation in a 1D problem and three, one in each space direction, in 3D."
"To solve the equations more information is often needed in the form of an equation of state. This relates thermodynamic properties (usually pressure and temperature) to each other for a specific type of fluid. An example is the ""Ideal Gas"" equation of state that relates pressure, temperature and density and works well for gases under normal pressures (like air at atmospheric pressure)."
Ernest Hemingway
"Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 - July 2, 1961) was an American writer. He wrote in a very simple way, which made him very popular. He also did many exciting things, which made many people respect him. He is usually thought to be a member of the Lost Generation."
"Ancient Hawaiians used rocks from rivers to cook pig. They heated the rocks in the imu and the pig cooked with steam. They covered the pig with banana leaves, ti leaves, old mats and then dirt to keep the heat inside. This produced a unique taste that cannot be reproduced."
People today kalua pig in the same way that ancient Hawaiians did. Kalua pig is still served at luaus.
Ultraviolet
"Ultraviolet is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum shown on the left side of the picture below as black—because humans cannot see light of such short wavelength (or high frequency). Many animals such as some insects, some reptiles, crocodiles, salamanders, and small birds can see things that this light. UV is a common abbreviation of ultraviolet, mainly used in technical contexts."
"Ultraviolet is beyond the visible violet light in terms of frequency, wavelength, and energy. Its wavelengths are between about 10 nanometers (nm) to about 400 nanometers. Frequency and wavelength are closely related. The equation that shows this relationship is: ν = c/λ . Saying that something has a short wavelength is the same as saying that it has a high frequency."
Ultraviolet radiation.
"Ultraviolet light is a type of ionizing radiation. It can damage or kill cells. Any electromagnetic radiation (light) that has a wavelength shorter than 450 nm may cause trouble. Therefore, humans that live in places with more ultraviolet light have adapted by getting darker skins. Pigments absorb the ultraviolet radiation, so it does not get through the skin to kill or injure cells inside. Injury to the skin by ultraviolet is called ""sunburn."""
"The violet light and ultraviolet light differ in their wavelength, frequency, and quantum energy. The differences between ultraviolet light and x-rays are also wavelength, frequency and quantum energy. In the electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet is beyond violet, x-rays are beyond ultraviolet, and gamma rays are beyond x-rays."
Electromagnetic waves with a wavelength from about 400 nanometers down to about 10 nanometers are commonly called ultraviolet. Their characteristic photon energy is about 3 to 124 electronvolts.
"Although the air of the Earth is transparent to a broad range of ultraviolet, some ultraviolet sunlight is absorbed at a very high altitude by the ozone layer. Recent and ongoing destruction of ozone in high altitudes caused by human influence—mostly by industrial chemicals and air travel—has greatly increased the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the Earth's surface. This, in turn, has increased the risk of skin cancer to mankind, and this risk will only increase with time unless the ozone layer is better protected."
"Ultraviolet wavelengths less than 200 nanometers, X-rays, and gamma rays, are collectively called ionizing radiation since the energy in any such light quantum is high enough to 'kick' an electron out of an atom. This is why these kinds of radiation are dangerous to life. Ultraviolet light is subdivided into three main bands. UV-C has the shortest wavelengths and is dangerous ionizing radiation. Nitrogen and oxygen absorb the UV-C from solar radiation. UV-B has medium wavelength and is less dangerous to living things. The Earth's ozone layer absorbs most of it. UV-A from the Sun gets through the atmosphere entirely. It has wavelength almost as long as visible light, and many animals can see it but humans cannot."
"Ordinary glass does not let radiation through if its wavelength is less than 200 nanometers, so it acts as a shield against the more dangerous range of ultraviolet light, but some special sorts of glass do not shield as well, including many car windows."
"One use for ultraviolet radiation is tanning. Use of tanning devices can cause skin cancer because ultraviolet goes through the skin and causes destruction to cells, causing sunburn."
"Because of the destructive power of ultraviolet light, it can be used to kill germs. Sunlight is a powerful disinfectant."
People need some ultraviolet light to convert cholesterol into vitamin D.
Ultraviolet lamp.
"An ultraviolet lamp is one that emits mostly ultraviolet light. These germicidal lamps are often used to kill microbes (germs). They can be very powerful, so the people who work around them when they are turned on may need to wear protective glasses and keep their skin covered to avoid injury."
"In the laboratory pictured, ultraviolet lights are turned on when the workers are gone, so that anything on the table surface will be killed. Besides ultraviolet light, which makes up most of the light produced by these lamps, there is also a little violet and blue light. This lets people know when the ultraviolet lamps are turned on."
Ornithology
Ornithology is the study of birds. A person who studies birds is called an ornithologist.
Aspects.
"Several aspects of ornithology differ from other disciplines, because they are easy to see and are often attractive. Many studies of birds have been done by amateurs working in a scientific manner."
History.
"Konrad Gesner wrote his ""Vogelbuch"" and ""Icones avium omnium"" around 1557. Later, England developed a tradition of ornithology. Francis Willughby, John Ray, Gilbert White, John Gould (who studied the birds of Australia) and Peter Scott are good examples."
What ornithologists do.
"Ornithologists typically trap birds for a closer look at them. This does not hurt the bird. Trapping birds can be done with in different ways, depending on the type of bird. For example, mist nets cause birds that fly into them to fall into a small pocket where the ornithologist can come back later and take a closer look."
"After the bird has been caught, the ornithologist will usually inspect (take a close look at) the bird. They may also attach a small ring to the bird's leg before releasing the bird. The ring allows ornithologists to study the bird's migration patterns, how long they live, and other information about the bird's species."
Rod Stewart
"Sir Roderick David Stewart, (born 10 January 1945) is a British pop singer, known professionally as Rod Stewart. He was born in London to an English mother and Scottish father. When he started singing in the 1960s, he was player for Brentford F.C., a football team. He started singing in local R&amp;B groups, in the 1970s he began a solo career which made him very famous."
Ferrari F50
The Ferrari F50 is a sports car made by Ferrari in 1995. It was created to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The car has two doors. It is a two-seated convertible with a removable hardtop. It has a 4.7 L V12 engine that was based on the 3.5 L V12 used in the 1992 Ferrari F92A Formula One car.
"Only 349 Ferrari F50's were made. This was because Ferrari wanted it to be rare. The last F50 was produced in Maranello, Italy in July 1997."
The Ferrari F50 can travel at over 200 miles per hour.
Mass spectrum
"A mass spectrum is an intensity versus ""m/z"" (mass-to-charge ratio) plot that represents a chemical analysis. The mass spectrum of a sample is a pattern representing the distribution of ions by mass (more correctly: mass-to-charge ratio) in a sample. It is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same. It can depend on the operating conditions of the instrument. For example, some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation. A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment; however, all plots of intensity vs. mass-to-charge are called ""mass spectra""."
Common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the McLafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage.
"In the past, chemists with PhD degrees were needed to interpret mass spectra. Today, computer programs read the data and identify the compounds in a sample."
Stuntman (video game)
"Stuntman is a racing/action video game that was published by Infogrames and Atari. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and the Game Boy Advance systems. The game is also featured as a mobile phone game which could be downloaded. Stuntman was followed by the 2007 sequel, . The game received positive reviews, GameSpot gave it a 8.0 out of 10 and IGN gave it a 8.6 out of 10."
"The game was followed by sequel, called """" released in 2007."
"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"
"""Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"" is a single by Lady Gaga. It appeared on Gaga's debut album ""The Fame"" and was released as a single on January 10, 2009. Its music video references Gaga's Italian heritage. Though the single did not chart in the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the song gold on February 29, 2016, for shipments and streams equal to 500,000 copies there. ""Eh, Eh"" charted in the top ten in France, New Zealand and Sweden."
SN2 reaction
"The SN2 reaction (also known as bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. It is a type of nucleophilic substitution, where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it. This expels another group called a ""leaving group"". So, the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name ""bimolecular nucleophilic substitution"", or ""SN2"". Among inorganic chemists, the SN2 reaction is often known as the ""interchange mechanism""."
Reaction mechanism.
"The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it - 'X' - frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate, and approximately sp2 hybridized. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180° to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C-X σ* antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed."
"If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, this can lead, although not necessarily, to an inversion of stereochemistry, called the Walden inversion."
"In an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of OH− (the nucleophile) on a bromoethane (the electrophile) results in ethanol, with bromide ejected as the leaving group:"
"A SN2 reaction occurs if the backside route of attack is not blocked by other atoms in the molecule (sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate). So, this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon center, the substitution will use an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would also be more likely with blocked molecules because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed.)"
"In coordination chemistry, associative substitution proceeds by a similar mechanism as SN2."
Factors affecting the rate of the reaction.
Four factors affect the rate of the reaction:
Reaction kinetics.
"The rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu−] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX]."
"This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction, the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over. But in a SN2 reaction, the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile. In cases where both mechanisms are possible (for example at a secondary carbon center), the mechanism depends on solvent, temperature, concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group."
SN2 reactions are generally favored in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent. They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance.
"The snare drum or side drum is a percussion instrument. It has strands of ""snares"" made of curled metal wire, metal cable, plastic cable, or gut cords. They are stretched across the skin on the bottom of the drum. Pipe and tabor and some military snare drums can have a second set of snares on the bottom side of the top head. This is used to make a ""brighter"" sound. The snare drum is considered one of the most important drums of the drum kit."
The snare drum can make some special sounds:
Economic boom
Economic boom is a phase when the economy has a huge increase. It is a natural cycle.
"The United States of America had an essential supply of natural resources such as timber, iron, coal, minerals, oil and land. Immigrants provided a plentiful and cheap work force to utilise these resources. This enabled America to become a huge economic power at the beginning of the 20th century. These resources were an important foundation for the economy."
"Whilst European economies suffered during the First World War, the USA experienced significant growth. US banks loaned money to Europe and businesses sold much needed goods. The war also provided a stimulus for inventions in production, materials and advertising. Immediately after the war there was a small slump but from 1922 the USA experienced an unprecedented economic boom."
"Electricity developed slowly before the war but during the 1920s the electricity industry experienced a huge boom. By 1929 the majority of houses in America had electricity and 70 per cent of them used it for lighting purposes. As a result of the development of factories to produce consumer goods for the American people, the demand for electricity doubled. Electrical power was introduced in factories to drive machinery, and thus it became possible to introduce mass production to a number of factories, e.g. refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and radio sets."
The car industry is the best example of mass production during the period. Henry Ford was a pioneer with his idea of producing affordable cars for the people of America. He set about realising his dream by producing his early cars in small workshops. He had groups of men working for him and gradually the cars were built.
Henry Ford and his son posing in the model F Ford car in 1905.
Henry Ford and his son posing in the model F Ford car in 1905
"Henry Ford's hard work bore fruit. As he produced more and more cars, he could reduce his prices. By 1925 the price of a car was around $290, which was much cheaper than the price of $850 in 1908. Henry Ford was of the opinion that it was better to sell more cars for a small profit, as that meant employing more workers."
"By 1929 Americans owned 23 million cars. The workers earned good wages ($5 per day), thousands of jobs were created, roads were built, petrol stations were built, as were hotels and restaurants. Therefore, the entire economy was given a substantial boost due to the car industry."
"In order to help American people to purchase the new goods that were available, systems of hire-purchase and credit were introduced. This meant that a person could buy something by paying for it on a monthly basis. As a result, the majority of Americans could afford expensive goods. In order to encourage Americans to take advantage of the scheme, advertisements were placed on roadsides, on the radio, in newspapers and in cinemas."
"During the same period, chain stores appeared for the first time, e.g. J P Penney. Catalogue shopping also became fashionable as it was a convenient way of buying goods."
Tremors (movie)
Tremors is an American science fiction comedy horror movie. It is set in Nevada and is directed by Ron Underwood. The screenplay was written by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock.
Plot.
"Valentine and Earl want to go to Bixby, Nevada and they leave the Perfection Valley. A subterranean animal kills five people. The Perfection Valley is in danger."
Tremor
"In biology, a tremor is when antagonist muscles move repeatedly without being controlled. There are different forms of tremors. Very often, a tremor is a symptom for another condition, and not its cause. People with a tremor are not necessarily sick. For example, physiological tremors are measurable, but not visible; they occur in all humans."
Grignard reaction
"The Grignard reaction (pronounced ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides (Grignard reagents) attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds (for example, in a carbonyl group as in the example shown below). Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles. The Grignard reaction produces a carbon–carbon bond. It alters hybridization about the reaction center. The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. It also can form carbon–phosphorus, carbon–tin, carbon–silicon, carbon–boron and other carbon–heteroatom bonds."
It is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction. The high pKa value of the alkyl component (pKa = ~45) makes the reaction irreversible. Grignard reactions are not ionic. The Grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster (in ether).
"The disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents (such as water), or with functional groups with acidic protons, such as alcohols and amines. Atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a Grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide. One of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame-dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture, which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning. Chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present. This can allow Grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present."
Another disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily form carbon–carbon bonds by reacting with alkyl halides by an SN2 mechanism.
"François Auguste Victor Grignard discovered Grignard reactions and reagents. They are named after this French chemist (University of Nancy, France) who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work."
Reaction mechanism.
The addition of the Grignard reagent to a carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state.
Development: 1989–2000.
"In 1989, HP thought Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were stuck at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers tried to create a new type of processor architecture, later called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), that allows the processor to use many instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC uses a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which 1 instruction word had many instructions. With EPIC, the compiler checks which instructions can be used at the same time, so the processor can run the instructions without needing complicated methods to see which instructions to use at the same time."
"The goal of this idea is to allow better inspection of the code at the time of compile to check for additional opportunities for multiple executions at once, and to simplify processor design and save electricity by removing the need for runtime scheduling instructions."
"HP thought that it was not good for individual enterprise system companies like HP to make proprietary processors, so HP worked with Intel in 1994 to create the IA-64 architecture, made with EPIC's ideas. Intel wanted to make a large effort in creating IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting processor would be used by most enterprise systems. HP and Intel had a large design effort to make the first Itanium product, Merced, in 1998."
"During creation, Intel, HP, and other industry analysts thought that IA-64 would be very popular in servers, workstations, and desktops, and one day replace RISC and Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architectures for multi-purpose applications."
Compaq and Silicon Graphics stopped working on their Alpha and MIPS architectures to move to the Itanium architecture.
"Many groups created operating systems for Itanium, including Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, Linux, and UNIX types such as HP-UX, Solaris,"
"Tru64 UNIX, and Monterey/64"
"(the last three were never finished work with running on Itanium). By 1997, many found that the Itanium architecture and the compiler were more difficult to use than they thought."
"Technology issues such as the very high transistor counts needed for the large instruction words and the large caches. There were also problems with the project, as the two parts of the team used different methods and had slightly different priorities. Because Merced was the first EPIC processor, its creation had more problems than the team had thought. In addition, the EPIC concept requires different compiler abilities that had never been created before, so more research was needed."
"Intel announced the name of the processor, ""Itanium"", on October 4, 1999."
"In only a few hours, the name ""Itanic"" had been used as a joke, (a reference to ""Titanic"", the ""unsinkable"" ship that sank in 1912 (""Itanium + Titanic = Itanic""))."
"""Itanic"" has also been used by ""The Register"","
"and others,"
"to say the multi-billion-dollar investment in Itanium, and the early demand with it, would mean nothing because they thought Itanium was going to fail."
Itanium (Merced): 2001.
"By the time Itanium was released in June 2001, its performance was not superior to competing RISC and CISC processors."
"Itanium competed with low-power systems (primarily 4-CPU and small systems) with servers based on x86 processors, and with high-power such as with IBM's POWER architecture and Sun Microsystems' SPARC architecture. Intel shifted Itanium to working with the high-power business and HPC computing, trying to copy x86's successful market (i.e., 1 architecture, many system vendors). The success of the 1st processor version was only with replacing PA-RISC in HP systems, Alpha in Compaq systems and MIPS in SGI systems, but IBM also made a supercomputer based on this architecture."
"POWER and SPARC were strong, and the x86 architecture grew more into the enterprise space, because of easier scaling and very large install base."
"Only a few thousand systems using the 1st Itanium processor, ""Merced"", were sold, because of poorer performance, high cost and less Itanium-made software."
"Intel saw that Itanium required more native software to work well, so Intel made thousands of systems for independent software vendors to help them make Itanium software. HP and Intel brought the 2nd Itanium processor, Itanium 2, to market a year later."
Itanium 2: 2002–2010.
"The Itanium 2 processor was released in 2002, for enterprise servers and not all of high-power computing. The 1st version of Itanium 2, code-named ""McKinley"", was created by HP and Intel. It fixed many of the problems of the 1st Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by a bad memory subsystem. ""McKinley"" had 221 million transistors (25 million of them were for logic), and was 19.5 mm by 21.6 mm (421 mm2) and was created with a 180 nm design process, and a CMOS process with 6 layers of aluminium."
"In 2003, AMD released the Opteron, which implemented the first x86-64 architecture (called AMD64 at the time). Opteron was much more successful because it was an easy upgrade from x86. Intel implemented x86-64 in its Xeon processors in 2004."
"Intel released a new Itanium 2 processor, code-named ""Madison"", in 2003. Madison used a 130 nm process and was the foundation of all new Itanium processors until June 2006."
"In March 2005, Intel announced that it was working on a new Itanium processor, code-named ""Tukwila"", to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have 4 processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which would also be used by a new Xeon processor."
"Later in that year, Intel changed Tukwila's release date to late 2008."
"In November 2005, the largest Itanium server makers worked with Intel and many software vendors to create the Itanium Solutions Alliance, to promote the architecture and speed up software porting."
The Alliance says that its members would invest $10 billion in Itanium solutions by the end of the decade.
"In 2006, Intel delivered ""Montecito"" (marketed as the Itanium 2 9000 series), a 2-core processor that had approximately 2x performance and 20% less energy usage."
"Intel released the Itanium 2 9100 series, codenamed ""Montvale"", in November 2007."
"In May 2009, the release for Tukwila, Montvale's successor, was changed again, with release to OEMs planned for the first quarter of 2010."
"Scholars disagree about the origins of the word ""sharia"". Some say that ""sharia"" comes from the old Arabic word meaning ""pathway to be followed"". This would make it similar to ""halakha"" (the way to go), the Hebrew word for Jewish law. Other scholars think that the word ""sharia"" originally meant ""path to the water hole"". They say that knowing the way to a water hole could save a man's life in the dry deserts where many Arabs lived in ancient times, and that is why this word came to refer to God's guidance to man."
Theory.
Islamic scholars who lived during the first centuries of Islam developed different methods for interpreting sharia. Most of them came to agree that sharia rules should be derived from the following main sources:
"The process of deriving sharia rules from the Qur'an and hadith is called ""ijtihad"". Sharia rules classify actions into one of the following categories:"
"These acts have ""material or moral"" provisions in the understanding of Sharia. The abandonment of the actions ""that are considered fard, wajib and sunnah"", and doing the forbidden ones ""that are considered makruh and haram"" are penalized. (hadd or tazir punishments). E.g; Beating, imprisoning and killing those who insist on not praying can be considered in this context."
"Sharia in Islam is viewed as the revealed law of God, which cannot be altered. On the other hand, its interpretation, called ""fiqh"", is the work of legal scholars, who have frequently differed in their legal opinions. Some parts of sharia are similar to what people in the West call ""law"", while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
"There are several schools of legal thought in Islam, of which the most important are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam and the Ja'fari school of Shia Islam."
Branches of sharia.
"The divisions of sharia are called ""branches"" (""furu"") in Arabic. The main branches are ""ibadat"" (rituals or acts of worship) and ""mu'amalat"" (human interactions or social relations). These branches are divided into many smaller branches, some of which are listed bellow:"
Acts of worship.
The Five Pillars of Islam are:
There are two festivals that are considered Sunnah.
There are some special rituals used during these festivals:
Dietary laws.
Islamic law lists only some specific foods and drinks that are not allowed.
"While Islamic law prohibits already-dead meat, this does not apply to fish and locusts. Also, hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth, birds having claws and talons in their feet, tamed donkeys, and any piece cut from a living animal."
Sacrifice.
There are some specific rules regarding the killing of animals in Islam.
Crime and punishment.
Sharia recognises three categories of crime:
"Although there is some disagreement about which crimes are ""hudud"" crimes, they usually include theft, highway robbery, zina (sex with forbidden partners), falsely accusing someone of ""zina"", and drinking alcohol. The prescribed punishments for these crimes range from 80 lashes to death. However, classical jurists developed very strict rules which restrict when these punishments could be applied, so that in many cases it became almost impossible to convict anyone under these rules. For example, there must be four adult male Muslim witnesses to a hudud crime or a confession repeated four times, before someone can be punished. If a criminal could not be convicted of a ""hudud"" crime, they could still receive a ""tazir"" punishment."
"In the historical practice, qisas appears in two ways. One of them is the punishment of the perpetrator with a “counter-action”, exactly the same as the crime committed, in crimes against the person's bodily integrity; A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth... etc."
"Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person ""of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs"" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of ""social equality"" in qisas means that; ""if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied"", whereas ""if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied"". On this pre-islamic understandings the discussion ""whether a Muslim could be executed for a non-Muslim"" was added in Islamic period."
"In these cases, ""compensation (Diya)"" can be paid to the family of the murdered person."
The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;
""": ""'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well."""
"While retaliation is certain in crimes of murder, according to the verse(2:178)), the situation is not clear in the crimes of wounding. For such (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, etc.) punishments, the expression ""This is how we wrote to them (the Children of Israel) in the book"", is used. (5: 45)"
"Murder, bodily injury and property damage - intentional or unintentional - is considered a civil dispute under sharia law. The victim, victim's heir(s) or guardian is given the option to either forgive the offender, demand Qisas (equal retaliation) or accept a compensation (Diyya). Under sharia law, the Diyya compensation received by the victim or victim's family is in cash."
Apostasy is punished by death unless the apostate agreed to return to Islam.
Legal system.
Muftis.
"During the Islamic Golden Age, sharia was interpreted by experts in Islamic law (""muftis""), most of whom were independent religious scholars. Anyone could ask them a question about law, and they were expected to give an answer for free. Their legal opinions were called ""fatwas""."
Itanium is or was supported (i.e. Windows version can no longer be bought) by the following operating systems:
"Microsoft announced that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be the last version of Windows Server to support the Itanium (support started with XP), and that it would also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server."
"Likewise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (first released in March 2007) was the last Itanium edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
"and Debian no longer supports Itanium officially (last release with official support was Debian 7 / Wheezy, and was not covered by Long Term Support (LTS), but unofficial support for newer Debian is still available in limited form via Debian Ports; last available kernel in wheezy-backports is Linux 3.14.0, which was released on March 30, 2014, but it is possible to manually update to latest 3.14.x version, or more recent kernel versions, like 4.17.17 as of September 2018) and in addition Canonical Ltd. chose to not support Itanium for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (released in April 2010, now discontinued)."
HP will not be supporting or certifying Linux on Itanium 9300 (Tukwila) servers.
"In late September 2012, NEC announced a return from IA-64 to the previous NOAH line of proprietary mainframe processors, now produced in a quad-core variant on 40 nm, called NOAH-6."
HP sells a virtualization technology for Itanium called Integrity Virtual Machines.
"To allow more software to run on the Itanium, Intel supported the development of compilers optimized for the platform, especially its own suite of compilers."
"Starting in November 2010, with the introduction of new product suites, the Intel Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the Intel x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools and Intel x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles."
"GCC,"
Open64 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (and later)
"are also able to produce machine code for Itanium. According to the Itanium Solutions Alliance over 13,000 applications were available for Itanium-based systems in early 2008,"
though Sun has contested Itanium application counts in the past.
"The ISA also supported Gelato, an Itanium HPC user group and developer community that ported and supported open-source software for Itanium."
Emulation.
"Emulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer. Before IBM's acquisition of QuickTransit in 2009, application binary software for IRIX/MIPS and Solaris/SPARC could run via type of emulation called ""dynamic binary translation"" on Linux/Itanium. Similarly, HP implemented a method to execute PA-RISC/HP-UX on the Itanium/HP-UX via emulation, to simplify migration of its PA-RISC customers to the radically different Itanium instruction set. Itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment GCOS from Groupe Bull and several x86 operating systems via instruction set simulators."
Competition.
"Itanium is aimed at the enterprise server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle Corporation's SPARC M7, Fujitsu's SPARC64 X+ and IBM's POWER8. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors."
"In 2005, Itanium systems accounted for about 14% of HPC systems revenue, but the percentage has declined as the industry shifts to x86-64 clusters for this application."
"An October 2008 paper by Gartner, on the Tukwila processor stated that ""...the future roadmap for Itanium looks as strong as that of any RISC peer like Power or SPARC."""
Supercomputers and high-performance computing.
"An Itanium-based computer first appeared on the list of the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an ""Itanium 2"" based system in the list was #2, achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012."
Processors.
Released processors.
"The Itanium processors show a progression in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with the shift to a 130 nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90 nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667 MHz."
Future processors.
"During the HP vs. Oracle support lawsuit, court documents unsealed by Santa Clara County Court judge revealed in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel Corp. around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium central processing units for HP's machines until 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform."
Kittson.
"""Kittson"" is planned to follow Poulson in 2015. Kittson, like Poulson, will be manufactured using Intel's 32 nm process. Few other details are known beyond the existence of the codename and the binary and socket compatibility with Poulson and Tukwila, though moving to a common socket with x86 Xeon ""will be evaluated for future implementation opportunities"" after Kittson."
E. L. James
"Erika Mitchell (born 7 March 1963), known by her pen name as E. L. James is an English author. James was born in London. She was raised in Buckinghamshire. She studied History at the University of Kent. James wrote: ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", """", ""Fifty Shades Freed"", and ""Fifty Shades Darker""."
Macroevolution.
"Macroevolution: the study of changes above the species level, and how they take place. The basic data for such a study are fossils (palaeontology) and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Some subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution:"
"It is a term of convenience: for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolution.p87 For some palaeontologists, what they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis. They are in the minority."
Altruism and group selection.
"Altruism – the willingness of some to sacrifice themselves for others – is widespread in social animals. As explained above, the next generation can only come from those who survive and reproduce. Some biologists have thought that this meant altruism could not evolve by the normal process of selection. Instead a process called ""group selection"" was proposed. Group selection refers to the idea that alleles can become fixed or spread in a population because of the benefits they bestow on groups, regardless of the alleles' effect on the fitness of individuals within that group."
"For several decades, critiques cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution."
"In simple cases it can be seen at once that traditional selection suffices. For example, if one sibling sacrifices itself for three siblings, the genetic disposition for the act will be increased. This is because siblings share on average 50% of their genetic inheritance, and the sacrificial act has led to greater representation of the genes in the next generation."
"Altruism is now generally seen as emerging from standard selection. The warning note from Ernst Mayr, and the work of William Hamilton are both important to this discussion."
Hamilton's equation.
Hamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for altruistic behaviour will spread in a population. The gene will spread if rxb is greater than c:
where:
Sexual reproduction.
"At first, sexual reproduction might seem to be at a disadvantage compared with asexual reproduction. In order to be advantageous, sexual reproduction (cross-fertilisation) has to overcome a two-fold disadvantage (takes two to reproduce) plus the difficulty of finding a mate. Why, then, is sex so nearly universal among eukaryotes? This is one of the oldest questions in biology."
The answer has been given since Darwin's time: because the sexual populations adapt better to changing circumstances. A recent laboratory experiment suggests this is indeed the correct explanation.
"In the main experiment, nematode worms were divided into two groups. One group was entirely outcrossing, the other was entirely selfing. The groups were subjected to a rugged terrain and repeatedly subjected to a mutagen. After 50 generations, the selfing population showed a substantial decline in fitness (= survival), whereas the outcrossing population showed no decline. This is one of a number of studies that show sexuality to have real advantages over non-sexual types of reproduction."
What evolution is used for today.
"An important activity is artificial selection for domestication. This is when people choose which animals to breed from, based on their traits. Humans have used this for thousands of years to domesticate plants and animals."
"More recently, it has become possible to use genetic engineering. New techniques such as 'gene targeting' are now available. The purpose of this is to insert new genes or knock out old genes from the genome of a plant or animal. A number of Nobel Prizes have already been awarded for this work."
"However, the real purpose of studying evolution is to explain and help our understanding of biology. After all, it is the first good explanation of how living things came to be the way they are. That is a big achievement. The practical things come mostly from genetics, the science started by Gregor Mendel, and from molecular and cell biology."
Evolution gems.
"In 2010 the journal ""Nature"" selected 15 topics as 'Evolution gems'. These were:"
Responses to the idea of evolution.
Debates about the fact of evolution.
"The idea that all life evolved had been proposed before Charles Darwin published ""On the Origin of species"". Even today, some people still discuss the concept of evolution and what it means to them, their philosophy, and their religion. Evolution does explain some things about our human nature. People also talk about the social implications of evolution, for example in sociobiology."
"Some people have the religious belief that life on Earth was created by a god. In order to fit in the idea of evolution with that belief, people have used ideas like ""guided evolution"" or ""theistic evolution"". They say that evolution is real, but is being guided in some way."
"There are many different concepts of ""theistic evolution"". Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution. As Darwin realised, the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is what it means for human origins."
"In some countries, especially in the United States, there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who do not accept it. The debate is mostly about whether evolution should be taught in schools, and in what way this should be done."
"Other fields, like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts. These ideas were once also fiercely opposed. Death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that Earth was the center of the universe."
"Evolutionary biology is a more recent idea. Certain religious groups oppose the idea of evolution more than other religious groups do. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church now has the following position on evolution: Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical ""Humani Generis"" published in the 1950s:"
"Pope John Paul II updated this position in 1996. He said that Evolution was ""more than a hypothesis"":"
The Anglican Communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution.

Paulo Freire
"Paulo Freire (September 19, 1921 - May 2, 1997) was an educator born in Brazil. He developed new ideas about education for the oppressed - people who have been trodden down."
Quotes.
"Paulo Freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as Plato, but also from modern Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. In fact, in many ways his ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"" (1970) may be best read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon’s ""The Wretched of the Earth"" (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern (rather than traditional) and anti-colonial (not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer)."
"In ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"" (1970), Freire, talks about the oppressors-oppressed distinction,seeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society: the oppressor and the oppressed. Freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction, which stems back to a least Hegel in 1802, and has since been reprised by many authors including Engels, Marx, Lenin, Gramsci, Simone Weil and others."
"Freire advocates that education allows the oppressed to regain their humanity and overcome their condition; however, he acknowledges that in order for this to take effect, the oppressed have to play a role in their own liberation. As he states:"
"No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption (Freire, 1970, p. 54)."
"Likewise, the oppressors must also be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in the oppression if true liberation is to occur; ""those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly"" (Freire, 1970, p. 60)."
The ideas of Paulo Freire.
"Freire believed education to be a political act that could not be divorced from pedagogy. Freire defined this as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the ""politics"" that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom (Kincheloe, 2008). Freire believed that ""education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing — of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't"" (Freire, 2004, p. 15)"
Pedagogy: How teachers teach.
"In terms of actual pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the ""banking"" concept of education, in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. He notes that ""it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power"" (Freire, 1970, p. 77). The basic critique was not new — Rousseau’s conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from tabula rasa (which is basically the same as the “banking concept”). In addition, thinkers like John Dewey were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, explaining that “education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction” (1897, p. 16). Freire’s work, however, updated the concept and placed it in context with current theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what is now called critical pedagogy."
Teachers and students: an organic whole.
"More challenging is Freire's strong aversion to the teacher-student difference. This splitis admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey, but Freire comes close to insisting that it be completely abolished. This is hard to imagine in absolute terms, since there must be some enactment of the teacher-student relationship in the parent-child relationship, but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student. He goes so far as to say that “Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously students and teachers” (Freire, 1970, p. 72). Freire wants us to think in terms of teacher-student and student-teacher – that is, a teacher who learns and a learner who teaches – as the basic roles of classroom participation."
"Freire however insists that educator and student, though sharing democratic social relations of education, are not on an equal footing, but the educator must be humble enough to be disposed to relearn that which he/she already thinks she knows, through interaction with the learner. The authority which the educator enjoys must not be allowed to degenerate into authoritarianism; teachers must recognize that ""their fundamental objective is to fight alongside the people for the recovery of the people's stolen humanity"", not to ""win the people over"" to their side (Freire, 1970, p. 95)."

"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"
"Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing."
"So, you like fresh water."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing because you get, I get sea sick"
Uh-huh.
Oh I see
"Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,"
"so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing."
"Now, that would be nice."
"Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,"
Uh-huh.
and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
Uh-huh.
"and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean"
"Oh, my goodness."
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
Uh-huh.
so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties
"so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun."
Uh-huh.
Oh I bet it is.
There's so many different ways to catch fish.
Uh-huh.
"You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that."
"Which isn't technically fishing,"
but it's a lot of fun.
Uh-huh.
"So, I, I grew up fishing."
Uh-huh.
What area of lakes do you like?
"Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,"
"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men."
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved"
"but, uh, they really were helpful, I know, to our house."
"It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it"
Yeah
Yes
That's awful.
"Um, Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting."
We've got a scout coming up
"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets,  and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that."
Huh-uh.
"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son"
"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather,"
"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there,"
and we took down that paneling
and he helped me
"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him. And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,  like that."
Huh-uh.
"How does the paneling,"
"it looks lots better than,"
do you like it better?
"Oh, I like it so much better."
It makes it so much lighter.
Yeah.
"You know, it really does."
"You know, and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked,  much better, too."
Huh-uh.
That's nice.
It's been fun.
"Nice to have it come out positive and look,  look good."
Yeah.
"but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers."
Sure.
"So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,"
"example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,"
"it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know"
They quit buying it.
"Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?"
"Well, tell me about your home."
Okay.
"Uh, right now we're living in,"
"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys."
"And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it."
Uh-huh.
"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,"
"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us."
So it was enough.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half."
"Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom."
Yeah.
"So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house"
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
Huh.
"And, uh, it's about a five year old house now."
It sounds nice.
"It's, uh, pretty nice."
"Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already"
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"It was a,"
Landmark is the one who built it.
Yeah.
oh I can't even think of the name of it.
I was halfway listening while I was painting
Uh-huh.
"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children"
Uh-huh.
"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C"
"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care   and leaving them there."
Yeah.
Oh that would be hard.
"You know, so, um,"
"Well, they give a lot more leave."
"I work at N C N B now,"
"and our benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people are, are really expanding."
Uh-huh.
"We have more options now then we did when I, my kids were born,"
"with being able to take off full-time longer of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for   up to six months."
Uh-huh.
"Oh boy, that's great."
It's really neat.
"I've, I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week"
"or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We try to work it with their hours.
"And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say  okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again."
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.
"I've,"
"of course it's too late for me so  I've, I've not tried them to see how effective they are"
Yeah
"you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,"
I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
Yeah.
"Uh, you know."
"I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas"
"and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>."
"You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,"
"uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,"
"and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand."
"And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S"
Uh-huh.
"and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico."
"Yeah,"
definitely.
You just don't know what's going on.
Yeah.
"I'd, I,"
"every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas"
"and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C"
"and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too."
You you can tune into some stations
Uh-huh.
"and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events."
"Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area"
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.
There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.
Right.
"Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries."
I hadn't really thought about it
but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.
Right.
Exactly.
"Uh, I don't know."
"I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N."
"Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,"
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour
but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
"Right,"
yeah.
"and, uh,"
"but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,"
Yeah.
"I, I think I'd agree."
"A, a similar method of getting the news with me too."
"It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years."
"Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts."
Right.
"Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature"
"and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth."
Uh-huh.
Right.
Yeah.
"I know, the,"
"my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada."
"Uh,"
"That, that's true, you know."
"You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them."
Right.
Yeah.
"I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything"
"and, uh, it's amazing that,"
"Oh, for goodness sakes."
What do you do?
"Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, that's interesting."
"Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?"
"No,"
"mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of,"
"but, uh, I don't know,"
"I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh."
Right.
"I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything."
Uh-huh.
"Well I love to work outside, really,"
and I enjoy flowers and stuff.
"I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,"
and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
Okay.
"but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that."
"I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring"
Uh-huh.
"and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,"
"and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something"
Uh-huh.
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist
"Oh, that's terrible."
Twenty-three
"And I really feel bad about it,"
"it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, they're all gone at this point."
"but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,"
I just couldn't hack it.
Uh-huh.
"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today."
So there  was real continuity.
Oh.
She went back as a teenager
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
"Oh, my gosh."
"So, it, it was really neat."
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
"and  she just kept good people and  real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,"
Uh-huh.
Oh my goodness
and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.  That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. You know, to,"
Uh-huh.
you're lucky to have an art teacher
"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know."
Or pay for it after school.
Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
"and   you know, I willingly did it"
Oh is that right?
I had no idea.
"but I thought, this makes me angry."
This is something that ought to be in the schools  rather than some of the other stuff they do.
"and they cut each others throats until they're, they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat."
"And, uh, well, of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,"
that's government controlled.
"But, uh,"
"Well, I, I think another thing too that, um, I've had a little contacted with, uh,"
"in regard to taxes let's say that, uh, you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, you know, says, hey, we're not going to allow that."
"Well, I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you, you will not only payback that that you wrote off"
but you will at least double that amount
"and,"
"Oh, by the time you get through with the, uh the penalties."
Yes.
"And that's, to me there's something wrong there, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I can see paying the interest and some small penalty"
but they really stick it to you big time.
"Uh, I agree."
"I think the I R S is, uh, just too powerful."
There should be some sort of a control on it.
And they should be a little more humane.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
"Uh, the, uh, typical bureaucratic, I guess. That's, that's one of my pet peeves."
"I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the, the budget."
Uh-huh.
Very simple.
"Give, uh, uh, uh, government employees the average number of, uh, holidays as the, uh, private industry."
Yeah.
"I mean, you think about it now,"
"they, they get about sixteen holidays a year."
That's a lot.
It sure is.
"And I think here at TI we get, what is it nine or ten?"
I saw it three times.
Did you.
"I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background."
"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older"
"and, uh, he's not, you know,"
"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him"
"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,"
Yes.
"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth"
"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers."
That was neat.
Uh-huh.
"Well that's tremendous,"
"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family."
"Yeah,"
a lot.
And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
Uh-huh.
"No question,"
"he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that."
He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.
Uh-huh
"And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it"
"but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN."
"I mean he certainly didn't,"
"he only saw it one time,"
"and he didn't go back for more,"
"but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it"
"and, and,"
Well he at least saw it one time
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know"
"and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,"
but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
Uh-huh ery faint.
Right.
"and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off"
Uh-huh.
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
Right
"to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities."
Right.
"Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas."
"Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports."
Right.
Right.
"But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,"
That's true.
You can't play those things.
"Yeah,"
you can't do it.
"But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times."
"Well, that's true."
"I guess, you know, you were talking about your,"
"was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
And they love to recollect.
"I mean they just, you know,"
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory.
"it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>."
"Oh absolutely,"
"yeah,"
just muggy.
"So, yes"
"I think,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
Our most pollute substance down here is just water.
"But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place."
Yeah
"it,"
"You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those"
"and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around."
"Oh, yeah."
"I, you know, I was in Boston once"
"and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee."
"Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing"
Absolutely.
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.
"I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,"
I think that's biggest problem
"because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city."
Right.
"And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really."
"Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help"
but if you have nowhere to do anything.
"That's, that's very true."
"Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere."
"But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,"
"you've got that,"
and you got the cars.
"Yeah,"
that's the exact opposite.
"We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up."
We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work
"and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together"
"and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that."
Yeah.
I we didn't know a thing about any of that
"and so,  It's, it looked very hard to do"
My wife wishes I hadn't done that.
"so,"
"we figured well just,"
I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
"So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living."
"But,"
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'
Probably so
"and I, we'd never done it"
so we just left it alone.
"But that's,"
"I guess, I'm only twenty-one"
"so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much."
"So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents"
so.
"Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage"
"or was it stuff that was already, uh, enclosed?"
It was brand new.
Brand new .
We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
"so it was,"
"and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?"
"Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know."
and I think that's wrong.
"I,"
I agree
"and, and, uh, I, I also think we extend too much help to other, uh, countries"
we need enough help here in this country.
That's right.
They're still people starving people here *They're There're
why should we help starving people somewhere else.
Yeah.
And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.
Absolutely.
"Now I can't wait for, uh,"
"I, I could just picture what's going to happen here in the not to distant future."
"We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh, uh-huh, the, the, the big, war over there in the Mideast."
The war.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, so many billions of dollars here and there and everything"
"and, uh, the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland"
"and say, well, just forget it."
Yeah.
And I think that's a mistake.
"Oh, definitely."
"Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away."
"Well, another thing now they keep decontrolling different things."
"First, it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association, and whatnot."
We know what trouble they got into
Exactly.
"And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were, uh, controlled and, and, uh, Transcontinental or, um, um, Interstate, uh, Trucking."
"I mean, as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket."
Yeah.
Prices went sky high.
"Then, in, in the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive"
Yeah.
"but,"
"Catches you off guard, doesn't it?"
"Yes,"
"yes,"
"some of them, some of them do"
"and some of them don't,"
"but, uh, this one, uh,"
I was trying to remember back.
"It seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state."
I didn't think they were either.
I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I, I guess,"
"and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh, that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever."
Changes.
Uh-huh.
"I,"
"yeah,"
"but, I, yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that."
"I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system."
"That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever."
Exactly.
Exactly.
That would be a really good thing to do.
"That would be a, a really good thing to do."
So it's
"I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,"
Huh.
"and what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight"
and he ran into the motorcycle.
Huh.
"But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle."
He was just taking it home from the place.
"It was brand new,"
and his brakes did not work.
For goodness sakes.
"And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady"
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
Uh-huh.
and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.
"Oh, they saw the husband,  get,"
That's right.
They were following him home from the motorcycle shop.
Yeah.
"And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other."
"Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,  of a settlement,"
Uh-huh.
They would find something wrong with it.
"Until finally they won and,  said that it was the drunk driver's fault"
Did they really?
Uh-huh.
"but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,"
That is a shame.
"You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,  to, to also, uh, make statements,"
Right.
"and, uh, it's, it's interesting."
"Yeah,"
that would be.
I usually vote.
"A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,"
Uh-huh.
"so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote."
Right.
"There for a while, that would, that worked."
"We've, uh, I know I have, um,"
"I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy"
Yeah.
"or, you know, they're both just as bad,"
"and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party,"
"and, um, but"
yeah.
"You know, that's not the best way"
"but,"
"No,"
I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
"But it gets to the point where,"
"I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for."
"Right,"
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
"Right,"
"or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous."
Yeah.
"I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections."
Yeah.
"I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know,"
Yeah.
"And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it."
Yeah.
"But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable."
"I don't,"
a lot of that's that recyclable steel
and I don't know anybody that takes that.
"Yeah,"
that's true .
my husband likes Pepsi
"and those cans are steel instead of aluminum,"
"so we can't, can't ever recycle them."
I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
"Um, now I didn't know that,"
"cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles."
"Yeah,"
"that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler"
Yeah.
"But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling."
Okay.
It was good talking to you.
Okay.
"Uh, bye."
"All right,"
bye-bye. voice said what's that
"voice said, where were they"
There you go.
What do you think invades your privacy? heavily
"Oh, well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. You know, that, that try to sell you the newspaper, and, uh, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair"
"And enough,"
"well I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, uh, junk mail and, because, um, you just end up throwing it away most of the time."
"Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need."
"Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
Oh really?
I kind of like that system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"That's, that's not a bad system."
"But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit."
Yeah.
"But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in."
Yeah.
Right.
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.
exactly.
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.
"Right,"
exactly.
Insurance cases and things like that.
Yeah.
Where
"and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them  or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering"
Uh-huh
Exactly
exactly.
"So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government"
"but,"
Have you had that experience recently?
"Recently, I can't really say recently."
"But I think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta, Georgia."
"I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. These, like these juice machines"
"and, uh  the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay"
"Oh, yeah."
"but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting  uh, after,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it's amazing."
"There's, uh, there's a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,"
"her, her father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman."
"And the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years."
Yeah.
"And, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that got killed, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,"
"and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried out, you know,"
"he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people,"
"and the State still can't bring itself to, to execute, this guy."
"To, yeah, to carry it out."
It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.
"It does,"
"it really does, you know."
"She, and they have to go back, uh,"
"occasionally, you know, she has to write letters to the parole board and, you know, lawyers,"
"and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got to do something else, you know, write another letter, or do something."
Yeah.
"It's just,"
It should be over and done with.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, she should be getting on with her life, you know, getting, getting that part behind her,"
"but yet, it's, it's kind of tied to her the way it is now."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"And she winds up being a, a victim, day after day after day."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
right.
"A victim,"
"not only of, indirectly of the crime, but also indirectly by that, indirect involvement."
Oh.
so I'm going to have to golf in the evening
or I'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me.
Right.
"And I don't think the,"
"Okay,"
have you participated in anything like that?
"Well a little bit,"
we mostly do our newspapers.
"We keep our newspapers, and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that"
and we take them to be recycled.
"Uh-huh,"
"uh, we, we have a pretty nice recycling center, uh, in our city now"
and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there.
They're open like two days a week
and you can just take it up there and drop it off.
Uh-huh.
It's kind of fun.
"And everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to, help the earth, I guess."
Yeah.
And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
Yeah.
Yeah
my husband was complaining the other day
because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling
"like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there."
You're supposed to what.
"Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid."
But what are you supposed to do with them.
"Oh, okay."
And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags.
They won't take those.
"We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way."
Uh-huh.
And we have to bring the paper bags back every time. Because they won't take them.
Yeah.
"Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere"
or does someone pick them up?
"We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit"
"and then we take them, take them in."
Uh-huh.
"We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though,"
"our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them."
"Yeah,"
"we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,"
Uh-huh.
"so, we generally don't have those to do."
"Yeah,"
"it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do,"
"but. Do you, um, have any ideas on anything that would make,"
"You know, they, they charge you, you know,"
it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.
Uh-huh.
"And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup"
and some communities are trying to do that now.
"And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,"
Right.
"they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill."
Yeah
that would be a good idea.
That that might be a better way to do it.
Yeah.
"And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash."
Right.
"that can, that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day, or more in school"
"and so any other part of your life, that's going to definitely affect your school life, because you spend so much time there."
Yeah.
"And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you, from the minute that you walk in until, until you leave, your, your competing against somebody else"
"or your competing against, uh, a system or, or something, you know,"
Right.
"and then, a lot of"
there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive.
"They're cooperative rather than competitive,"
Uh-huh.
"and when they get into a real competitive system they just say, oh well, what the heck, and, uh, tend not to, you know, do too awful well ."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"I talked to, a guy the other day"
"and he is now in, in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he, he fell back several years ago"
"and he's going to, he, he will have gone to school five years."
Yeah.
"Um, and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died,"
Uh-huh.
"and he was having to, uh, support his entire family, take care of his brothers and sisters, you know,"
Uh-huh.
and all that had an adverse affect on his school life.
"I would think so,"
yeah.
"And, yeah,"
"and that, and that's a perfect example of how your home life, you know, plays a definite part."
"And, you know, any other aspect of your life,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"an, but now, now, that he's in this program and, you know, he's, I guess okay,"
"because there could be accidental kind of things, you know,"
Right.
"but they never told us why these two people, hated themselves or if one had done something to, you know, really aggravate the other"
"there was never any motive, given"
Uh-huh.
"and, and I had a tough time with that"
"and, and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did, because we were just observing, you know, there in the courtroom, at the end of it all, I still didn't know"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
I still have a lot of reasonable doubts
and I've seen everything presented
"and, you know, they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking."
Uh-huh.
"I don't know that I want to,  sit on a jury like that"
"I think so,"
"and I,"
"and you'd still, you know,"
I want ask some questions here
"Yeah,"
that's something I thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen.
Uh-huh.
"And it seems to me that you'd get a lot more, uh, information if your questions were heard, if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things, or if, or the lawyers things or even the judge."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But particularly the witnesses.
Right.
"Yeah,"
"allow them to, uh, go back and, and deliberate and, uh, you know, after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day, bring those people back,"
"Or if they would allow them to, uh, give broader answers, they,"
"it's really kind of, uh, choreographed."
It's like a script has been written when people testify.

"Dhamaal (; English translation: ""Fun"") is a 2007 Indian comedy film directed by Indra Kumar and produced by Ashok Thakeria. The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Aashish Chaudhary and Javed Jaffrey in the lead roles while Asrani, Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Raaz, Manoj Pahwa and Tiku Talsania are featured in supporting roles. It is heavily inspired from Rat Race which is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker, and some scenes are shot-for-shot copies from other Mr. Bean Movies. It is the first installment of ""Dhamaal film series"". The film was remade on 2008 Kannada movie ""Mast Maja Maadi""."
"In 2011, the film spawned a sequel, under the title of ""Double Dhamaal"", with the lead cast reprising their roles."
"A third sequel, under the name ""Total Dhamaal"" was released in February 2019, with only Deshmukh, Warsi and Jaffrey returning with an entirely new cast and a fresh story, having no connections to ""Dhamaal"" and ""Double Dhamaal."""
"Four good-for-nothing friends - Roy (Ritesh Deshmukh), Adi (Arshad Warsi), Boman (Aashish Chaudhary), and Manav(Javed Jaffrey) - are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. However, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to Dwiwedi. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal, not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma). He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered, he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words ""horse"" and ""grass."" He interprets these words to be some code language. The four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass on the painting, he immediately arrests them."
"On the highway, Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realizing that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose (Prem Chopra). He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 crore in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree, breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. They manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off."
"Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money."
"All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. All of them except Kabir reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow defecates on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened. Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination."
"The film's soundtrack is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics penned by Sameer. The songs, ""Dekho Dekho"" and ""Miss India Marthi Mujhpe"", were both known as the title song, since the main chorus of both the songs included the title ""Dhamaal""."
"A sequel named ""Double Dhamaal"" was released in 2011. Third film of the franchise was named Total Dhamaal and released in 2019. Both the movies became huge box office hits."

= = = Kisumu RFC = = =
"Kisumu Rugby Football Club is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Kisumu. Also known as Lakeside RFC, for the 2015-16 season the club competes in the Nationwide League."
"Kisumu was founded in 1982, by David Mshila, Dennis Awori, Job Owino, Jack Ogal, Jim Owino, and Jos Odaga. They were originally based at the Kisumu Railway Club and the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu. Kisumu Boys High School also served as a training venue for years. Kisumu Technical High School (later called Kisumu Polytechnic - Makasembo) (1997) was used as a venue for games because of the good grass facility. In 1983 Kisumu combined with Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret to form KITUSUMU: an acronym for Kitale and Kisumu.J.B Nyamwange, Jack and Walter Omaido came in from Kitale. Reg ’Pape” Sembi of Kakamega, a Canadian member of the Peace Corps Johnson Travis and Paul Scott of Eldoret. Records indicate that Barclays bank RFC travelled to Kakamega in 1985 playing Kisumu in the Enterprise Cup match. Barclays won the game 47-4. Kisumu and Kitusumu played mainly as a Western Kenya touring side but folded up in 1988."
"It is host to the Dala Sevens tournaments in the Kenya Rugby Football Union Calendar, one part of the Kenya National Sevens Circuit, today Safaricom Sevens series."
"Kisumu RFC was revived in late 1990 by rugby enthusiasts led by Mike Omondi, Bella Maguys, Gordon Raila, Peter Openda, Jim Owino, Dennis Otti, Joseph Owino, Eric Ogot, Sammy Ogot, Susan Nyaribo, Bob Bengo, Paul Okong’o, Nasser Midamba, Trevor Mugwanga, John Mark Magana, Oyunga Pala, Felix Okech and Issa Mohamed Issa amongst others. After the initial positive response to training, Jimmy Owino was appointed club coach. His initial task was to build a team with more commitment and solidarity, and to weed out the complacent ‘feel good attitude’ that had led to the dissipation of the original Kisumu RFC."
"Jimmy’s approach bore rapid results, but the next major obstacle became finance. At a team, ""Kamukunji"" it was unanimously agreed that Charles Lutta Kasamani be appointed Club patron, should he agree. He agreed. He donated playing kit, rugby balls and a first aid box. Some of the Kisumu-based personalities who raised funds tirelessly at the ""infamous"" Club Night at the Kisumu Hotel(Hotel Royale) pool side included Nilmar Darbar, Widar Krogsund, Ogweno Omwaga, Franz Bonn, Noel Okoth, Mike Humphreys, Morris Odhiambo, Jacko Omino, Peter Odaga, Paul Okullu, Peter Openda, Jos Odaga Charles Okuthe and many more whose names we cannot include here. An interim office of Charles Okuthe (Chairman) and Bella Maguys (Secretary) organized the first ever rugby tournament in Kisumu which was ‘not too good not too bad ‘in October 1991."
"The same office later organized Kisumu RFC elections which saw a new office of Peter Openda (Chairman) and Paul Okullu (Hon- Secretary) take over, with most of the interim office bearers not seeking re-election."
"From 1991 to 1996, Kisumu steadily concentrated on building a strong foundation by taking part in tournaments such as the Great Rift Valley 10-aside in Nakuru and Mombasa’s Driftwood Sevens. This was by choice because of a small player base and financial limitations. At the same time, the Club hosted the Kisumu Ten-aside event held between 1991 and 1994. With a rich hinterland of players from Maseno School, St. Mary's School Yala, Nyang'ori High School, Moi University and Maseno University there was light at the end of the tunnel. Mombasa businessman Edwin Yinda donated playing kit to the team after the Driftwood finals contested between Mean Machine RFC and Kisumu."
"Kisumu RFC first came to the fore when they reached the Driftwood 7s in Mombasa in 1994 losing in sudden death to Mean Machine RFC. Come 1997, Kisumu again reached the Finals of the Driftwood 7s in 1997 losing to the United States International University Africa."
"It is a Sunday in June 1997 and the George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial 7s is on at the Nairobi Railway Club. Kenya is playing, using the one-day event as preparation for the Tusker Safari 7s in a couple of week’s time. The squad is composed of Sammy Khakame, Paul Murunga, Tolbert Onyango, Ken Thimba, Gordon Anampiu, Felix 'Toti' Ochieng', Manuel Okoth, Steve Gichuki & Co. Kisumu RFC are also present and the players on show are Andrew Okwaro, Fred Jura, Frank Ndong' Steve Oloo, Issa Matan Issa, Moses Kola, Tony Lamba, Job Odonde and Dan Alego, Gordon Raila, Felix Oketch, Bob Bengo. Two weeks before at the driftwood sevens in Mombasa the lakeside outfit finished runners -up losing 19-7 to USIU-Africa."
"Kisumu had moved away from mere participation to competition and the rugby fraternity had taken notice. Expectations from both the playing unit and fanatics were high. Mean Machine RFC arrived and in the side was Eric 'Shaggy' Mwangi, Biko Ambesta, Ted Okinda, Ken Aswani, Kanyi Gitonga, Eric Musuva, Oyunga Pala, Kevin Matabutu, Sundiya Halwenge and Paul Okong'o."
"And the event kicked off and the usual winners and losers and it looked like a ""kawa"" event, till Kenya met Kisumu and there was fireworks. Kenya despite her constellation of international players with exposure in Selkirkshire, Dubai, Spain and Singapore struggled to beat Kisumu, but that was just round one. To the semis of the Main Cup and Kisumu again met Kenya while Mean Machine RFC played Nakuru RFC. Nakuru with Ben 'Benways' Otieno, Caleb Langat and the hard hitting and sometimes illegal play were too strong for Machine and that was the end for Machine."
"To the second semi and Kisumu versus Kenya and this was a nip and tuck battle. The crowd at the Railway Club was at full cry behind Kisumu. Tony Lamba after many years in the Ninja's outfit found a new life, and with a new team was in imperious form setting up, Jura, Okwaro, Kola and Co. However Kenya composed themselves and closed the match off to set up a final versus rift Valley side Nakuru. It was not Kenya's day as New winger Caleb Langat scored try after try, taking Kenya's winger's apart. Winners Nakuru RFC"
"By Monday of the new week, Call ups to Kenya, Andrew Okwaro and Fred Jura."
"A tour to Uganda in October saw them leave an indelible mark with their trademark hard running, tackling and skills level in a country which was just beginning to pick the game after a lull of over 20 years. The visitor's led 13-7 at halftime before the hosts recovered to win 47-13 in the second-half. This was a 'test' versus Uganda. Putting it mildly, 1997 marked the turning point for Kisumu Rugby. They did not look back and Kisumu became a fertile rugby nursery nurturing young players just out of school into mature club and national team material."
"Kisumu joined the Second division ESS in 1998 after winning the Bowl league in 1997. The ESS would prove tricky for Kisumu. The challenge came from two quarters, one depth in terms of players and two finances to honor 11 away games with most teams based in Nairobi. The league would be honored on and off between 1998 and 2002."
"Away from that the Management Board of Kisumu actively engaged the Union in trying to secure a future. In behind the scenes talks the Kisumu management Board asked the Union for one leg of the National Sevens Circuit. At talks in Moshi, Tanzania in December 2002 a hush-hush deal was done with the Hon-Secretary of the Union Richard Omwela who was scheduled to contest for the Chairmanship in a number of months."
"With Mount Kilimanjaro providing a spectacular backdrop, to the conversation he proposed a deal. In exchange for support from the Lakeside team at the election he agreed to give Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit. Present at the talks were Omwela, Aggrey Chabeda, John Akelola, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o. Kisumu also actively engaged Max Muniafu who was then Director for Development at the Union and argued for the same. Prior to Moshi talks were held with Max, David Akelola, Phillip Ocholla, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o at the Junction Inn restaurant in Kisumu to push for the same."
Surely enough one of the first acts by Omwela & Chabeda on their election as Chair and Secretary of the Kenya Rugby Football Union was to award Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit in early 2003 by 'Executive order'.

"Fucked Up is a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario, formed in 2001. The band consists of Damian Abraham (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Ben Cook (guitar, vocals), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals)."
"To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, ""The Chemistry of Common Life"". In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"", after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk."
"The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco)."
"Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7"" records. The band released the """"No Pasaran"""" 7"" in May 2002. The ""Police"" 7"" was released on March 2003, quickly followed the ""Baiting the Public"" 7"" in May 2003. Two more 7""'s followed in 2004, the ""Dance of Death"" single, and the ""Litany"" 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ""Epics in Minutes"" CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show."
"The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12""s, the ""Looking for Gold"" 12"", and the live ""Let Likes be Cured by Likes"" 12"". The ""Looking for Gold"" 12"" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling."
"In the summer of 2004 the band released the ""Generation"" 7"" and 12"" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ""Hidden World"" album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006."
"Several other records, such as ""Year of the Dog"" 12"" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on ""MTV Live"", where they were introduced as ""Effed Up"". During their performance of their song ""Baiting the Public"", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ""MTV Live"" performances."
"On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew."
"On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was ""f**king out of control terrifying."""
"In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ""Burn"", directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the ""New York Times"", although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks."
"The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the ""Year Of The Pig"" 12"" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7""es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast."
"On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, ""The Chemistry Of Common Life."" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more.

"Fucked Up were confirmed to play the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. The band also confirmed they will play their annual Halloween gig in Toronto, October 31, 2010. The band had initially cancelled the event due to scheduled tour with Against Me!. ""We were going to go on this tour in the UK with this band Against Me!, but then they cancelled all their shows for some reason (they never told us) so the tour isn't happening so we'll be in Toronto so we figure what the hell."" They were joined by The Sadies at The Garrison, Toronto."
"In February 2011, the band toured Australia for the first time as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Additionally, the band played some select side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as The Bronx, Terror, H20, Trash Talk and Polar Bear Club."
"On June 7, 2011, Fucked Up released their third studio album, ""David Comes to Life"". A self-professed ""rock opera"" set in Thatcherite Britain, it tells a story of love, loss and redemption. The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim."
"In November 2011 it was announced that the band would be going on hiatus, as Abraham is not able to handle raising a family and tour the same time."
"In December 2011, Spin magazine named ""David Comes to Life"" its No. 1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing ""Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic."""
"On February 7, 2012, the band was listed as one of the acts to be featured during the Orion Music + More Festival.

"In January 2008, Fucked Up, along with Xiu Xiu, filed a lawsuit against ""Rolling Stone"" and Camel Cigarettes for an advertisement that included both bands in an ""Indie Rock Universe"" special. The advertisement apparently portrayed the bands as supporters of Camel. Pink Eyes stated that ""The fact that ""Fucked Up"" was mentioned in there wasn't some great coincidence. This isn't a case of subliminal advertising, where we're claiming that there were penises in the shadows — our name is right there. Maybe they thought we were too stupid to know what was going on."""

= = = Wazir Mohammad = = =
Wazir Mohammad (born 22 December 1929) is a former Pakistani banker and cricketer who played in 20 Test matches from 1952 to 1959.
"Wazir was a determined middle-order batsman with a strong defence. His highest Test score was 189, in the Fifth Test against West Indies at Port of Spain in 1957-58, when he batted for six and three-quarter hours and laid the foundation for Pakistan's innings victory. He was Pakistan's top-scorer with 42 not out when they won by 24 runs against England at The Oval in 1954. His first-class career extended from 1950 to 1964, when he captained Karachi Whites to a narrow defeat in the final of the 1963-64 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He was appointed to captain the Pakistan Eaglets team of young players on their tour of England in 1963; 14 of the 18 players on the tour became Test cricketers, and four became Test captains."
"Wazir worked as a banker, mostly with the National Bank of Pakistan. His younger brothers Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq also played Test cricket for Pakistan. With the death of Israr Ali on 1 February 2016, Wazir became Pakistan's oldest living Test cricketer."
= = = Robert Stephenson and Company = = =
Robert Stephenson and Company was a locomotive manufacturing company founded in 1823. It was the first company set up specifically to build railway engines.
"The company was set up in 1823 in Forth Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England by George Stephenson, his son Robert, with Edward Pease and Thomas Richardson. The manager of the works between 1824 and 1825 was James Kennedy."
"The company's first engine was ""Locomotion No 1"", which opened the Stockton and Darlington, followed by three more: ""Hope"", ""Black Diamond"", and ""Diligence"". Their vertical cylinders meant these locomotives rocked excessively and at the Hetton colliery railway Stephenson had introduced ""steam springs"" which had proved unsatisfactory. In 1828 he introduced the ""Experiment"" with inclined cylinders, which improved stability, and meant that it could be mounted on springs. Originally four wheeled, it was modified for six and another example, ""Victory"", was built. Around this time, two locomotives were built for America. The first, a four coupled loco named ""America"", was ordered by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The second, six-coupled and named ""Whistler"", was built for the Boston and Providence Rail Road in 1833."
"In 1829, the company built a new, experimental locomotive to enter in the Rainhill Trials. Rocket had two notable improvements — a multi-tube boiler and a separate firebox. Rocket won the trials and convinced the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to use steam locomotives on their railway, and to order these locomotives from Robert Stephenson & Co. Rocket's cylinder were originally angled at an angle of 45 degrees, but were later moved to be horizontal."
"The ""Invicta"" was the twentieth Robert Stephenson & Co. locomotive, and was built for the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Its cylinders were inclined, but moved to the front end. In 1830 came the ""Planet"" class with the cylinders inside the frames, followed by the ""Patentee"", which added a pair of trailing wheels for greater stability with a larger boiler. This 2-2-2 design became the pattern for most locomotives, by a variety of manufacturers, for many years."
"The locomotive ""John Bull"", built in 1831, was originally of the ""Planet"" type, but was later modified. It survives and is now in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and is claimed to be the oldest still functional self-propelled vehicle."
"The increased distance travelled by many trains highlighted problems with the fireboxes and chimneys. With the co-operation of the North Midland Railway at their Derby works, he measured the temperature of the exhaust gases, and decided to lengthen the boilers on future engines. Initially these ""long-boiler"" engines were 2-2-2 designs, but in 1844, Stephenson moved the trailing wheel to the front in 4-2-0 formation, so that the cylinders could be mounted between the supporting wheels. It was one of these, the ""Great A"" along with another from the North Midland Railway, which was compared with Brunel's ""Ixion"" in the gauge trials in 1846. In 1846 he added a pair of trailing wheels - the first with eight wheels. Another important innovation in 1842 was the Stephenson link motion."
"Robert Stephenson and Company built a number of Crampton type locomotives for the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. These were all of 4-2-0 wheel arrangement with inside cylinders and indirect drive. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was coupled to the driving wheels by outside rods. They were unsuccessful on the LCDR, and the five ""Echo"" class locomotives were rebuilt as conventional 4-4-0 locomotives after only four years of service."
"The first railway proposal in Egypt came about when Pasha Muhammad Ali asked the British engineer T.H. Galloway to design a railway in 1834. Instructions to make it followed in 1836. Materials were delivered but little real construction followed. No Ottoman ""firwan"" (permission) was issued and the French objected. Progress was really made when in 1849 Muhammad Ali died, and in 1851 his grandson Abbas I of Egypt contracted Robert Stephenson to build Egypt's first standard gauge railway. The first section, between Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast and Kafr el-Zayyat on the Rosetta branch of the Nile was opened in 1854. This was the first railway in the Ottoman Empire as well as Africa and the Middle East. In the same year Abbas died and was succeeded by Sa'id Pasha, in whose reign the section between Kafr el-Zayyat and Cairo was completed in 1856 followed by an extension from Cairo to Suez in 1858. This completed the first modern transport link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, as Ferdinand de Lesseps did not complete the Suez Canal until 1869."
"At Kafr el-Zayyat the line between Cairo and Alexandria originally crossed the Nile with an 80 feet (24 m) car float. This was the single largest project of the South Street Works. However, on 15 May 1858 a special train conveying Sa'id's heir presumptive Ahmad Rifaat Pasha fell off the float into the river and the prince was drowned. Stephenson therefore replaced the car float with a swing bridge nearly long."
The Egyptian connections to Robert Stephenson were very considerable and a wealth of consequential artefacts are in Cairo Railway Museum. This includes what could well be the single most extravagant piece built by the Robert Stephenson Works. This is works number 1295 of 1862 whose artistic design was by Matthew Digby Wyatt. This 2-2-4T for the Egyptian Railways survives with all its fantastical marquetry in the Egyptian Railway Museum at Cairo. It is called the Khedive's Train.
"Over the remainder of the century, the company prospered in the face of increasing competition, supplying railways at home and abroad. By 1899 around 3000 locomotives had been built and a new limited liability company was formed, Robert Stephenson and Company Limited and the works was moved to Darlington, the first locomotive leaving the shop in 1902."
"Most railways in Britain were building their own rolling stock, so most of the output was for export, from 4-4-0's for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway to GS (4-6-0) and HS (2-8-0) classes for the Bengal Nagpur Railway. These preceded the slightly larger BESA standard designs for the Indian railways. The works built the first British 2-10-0 for the Argentine Great Western Railway in 1905."
"During World War I, the company devoted itself to munitions work. However, between 1917 and 1920, a large batch of ROD 2-8-0 and SNCV type 18 0-6-0 tram locomotives were ordered by the War Office for use on the continent. From then on, business was slack, for various reasons. Notable were thirty 2-6-0 mixed traffic locomotives for the GWR in 1921, a batch of thirty 0-6-0 tank engines for the LNER and five 7F 2-8-0s for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. In 1936 and 1937, only forty six were built, including eleven B17 class (""Sandringham"") 4-6-0s for the LNER, and seven 2-6-4 passenger tank locomotives for the South Indian Railway Company."
"In 1937, the company merged with the locomotive interests of Hawthorn Leslie and Company to form Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Limited. The company's shipbuilding activities continuing separately. Main line locomotives continued to be built at Darlington, while industrial engines were built at Hawthorne Leslie's works at Forth Bank, Newcastle. in 1938 the goodwill of the Kitson and Manning Wardle companies was bought."
"WPBF presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays)."
"Initially, WPBF had a small news department as it did not plan to launch one until after it received the ABC affiliation. After being purchased by Paxson Communications, the station added additional newscasts to its schedule. For a long time they struggled with ratings in their own market, which is attributable to WPLG's very strong over-the-air signal in Palm Beach County and its availability on Comcast throughout the area. However with Hearst's traditional hard news focus on their stations soon instituted within WPBF's news operation, WPBF eventually became a spirited second place news operation, and WPBF usually outranks WPEC currently in most timeslots (NBC affiliate WPTV has been well dominant in the market for years)."
"On July 12, 2006, it started airing a half-hour newscast called ""Weather First at 4"" on weekdays becoming the first station in West Palm Beach to do so. While the main intention of the new broadcast was to cover West Palm Beach area weather, news updates and headlines were added after a short time. This production is streamed live on their website. On July 17, 2006, WPBF added thirty minutes to its weekday morning show which began airing at 5:30. It became a full two-hour broadcast on January 28, 2008. The station debuted a new traffic reporting system featuring data from Traffic.com on February 14 that included a new traffic segment, ""Beat the Traffic"", seen on weekdays."
"Expansion of local news continued with the launch of a weekend morning newscast on March 8. On August 18, 2008, WPBF began broadcasting a broadcast at noon during the week which is also streamed live on its website. On September 14, 2009, the station debuted a new logo, set, and graphics package while expanding the 4 p.m. newscast to an hour. WPBF dropped weeknight newscasts in the 5 p.m. hour to make room for ""Dr. Phil"" which had moved to the station from WPTV; that change has since been reverted, for as of September 12, 2011, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" replaced the 4 p.m. newscast."
"Until October 4, 2010, WPBF was the only channel in the West Palm Beach market that did not offer newscasts in high definition or even enhanced definition widescreen. However, WPBF was operating HD-ready studios and field cameras for its broadcasts. The shows were displayed in pillarboxed standard definition while showing the station's logo and ""HD"" in the left and right thirds of the screen. On October 4 starting with the weeknight 4 p.m. newscast, WPBF started broadcasting local news in high definition. Upon the upgrade, it began using an updated music package and slightly revised HD graphics previously used by sister station WESH in Orlando. In December 2012, WPBF upgraded their graphics package to the new Hearst Television graphics along with new music and talent opens. However, like another sister station, KSBW in Salinas, California, HD is not mentioned in the news openings. WPBF will also continue to display HD in the left and right thirds of the screen when video footage is shown in 4:3 standard definition. The station does not currently operate a sports department which is unusual for both a big three network channel and a Hearst-owned station."

= = = Marge Champion = = =
"Marjorie Celeste Champion (née Belcher; born September 2, 1919) is an American dancer and actress. At a young age, she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated films. Later, she performed as an actress and dancer in film musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley."
"Marge Champion was born as Marjorie Celeste Belcher on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (née Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide."
"Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet ""Carnival in Venice"". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure."
"In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907–1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940."
"In 1947, she married dancer Gower Champion (1919–1980). They had two sons, Blake and actor Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. Belcher met Gower when she was 12 years old in the ninth grade at Bancroft Junior High and that's when their romance started. Although performances often took them away from California, Los Angeles remained their home base."
"In 1977, she married director Boris Sagal. Sagal was killed on May 22, 1981, in an accident during the production of the miniseries ""World War III"". She became stepmother to Boris' five children, who include Katey, Jean, Liz, and Joey."
"The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was ""The Castles"" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for."
"Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (1946), ""Show Boat"" (1951) and ""Everything I Have Is Yours"" (1952). Other films with Gower included ""Mr. Music"" (1950, with Bing Crosby), ""Give a Girl a Break"" (1953), ""Jupiter's Darling"" (1955), and ""Three for the Show"" (1955). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, but only one, ""Lovely to Look At"" (1952), a remake of ""Roberta"" (1935), was completed. The couple refused to remake any of the others, the rights to which were still owned by RKO."
"Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of ""What's My Line"". Mary Healy guessed who they were."
"During the summer of 1957, the Champions had their own TV series, ""The Marge and Gower Champion Show"", a situation comedy with song and dance numbers. Marge played a dancer and Gower a choreographer. Real-life drummer Buddy Rich was featured as a fictional drummer named Cozy."
"In the 1970s, Champion, actress Marilee Zdenek, and choreographer John West were part of a team at Bel Aire Presbyterian Church that created a number of creative worship services featuring dance and music. They later offered workshops and related liturgical arts programs throughout the country. She and Zdenek co-authored two books, ""Catch the New Wind"" and ""God Is a Verb"", related to this work."
"In 1978 she served as a dialogue and movement coach for the TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", adapted from Conrad Richter's trilogy of the same name. It was set in the late 18th-century Ohio Valley."
"Champion has also worked as a dance instructor and choreographer in New York City. In 1982, she made a rare television acting appearance on the dramatic TV series ""Fame"", playing a ballet teacher with a racial bias against African-American students."
"Champion appeared in several stage musicals and plays on Broadway as a performer. She made her New York debut in ""What's Up"" (1943). She also performed in the ""Dark of the Moon"" (1945) as the Fair Witch, and ""Beggar's Holiday"" (1946) having multiple roles. She made her last Broadway appearance in ""3 for Tonight"" in 1955. She also worked as a choreographer or Assistant, including ""Lend an Ear"" in 1948 as assistant to the Choreographer; ""Make a Wish"" in 1951, as assistant to Gower Champion; ""Hello, Dolly!"" in 1964 as special assistant; and ""Stepping Out"" (1987) as choreographic associate. In 2001, she appeared as Emily Whitman in the Broadway stage revival of ""Follies""."
"Champion states ""as a dancer, by the time you're 40 you're done. If I ever come back, I want to be an actress- it lasts long. But I was 81 when I was in ""Follies""."
"Marge Champion has been interviewed in numerous documentaries, including for the behind-the-scenes documentary directed by Oscar-winner Chris Innis, ""The Story of the Swimmer"", which was featured on the 2014 Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of ""The Swimmer"". She was also interviewed at a Hollywood film festival screening of ""The Swimmer"" by filmmaker Allison Anders for the same release.

"Mia Baran is a devout Catholic schoolteacher at a boys' school outside Pittsburgh where her husband, Guy, is schoolmaster. Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box."
"While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them."
"After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window."
"Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious."
"That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious."
"Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom."
"Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The St. Philomena School was used as the primarily filming location."
"The movie was compared unfavorably to the original movie, and received overall negative reviews. It currently holds a 'rotten' 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for ""Worst New Star"" (as the new ""serious"" Sharon Stone) for this film and ""Last Dance"", where she lost to Pamela Anderson for ""Barb Wire""."

"The Blephariceridae, commonly known as net-winged midges, are a nematoceran family in the order Diptera. The adults resemble crane flies except with a projecting anal angle in the wings, and different head shape, absence of the V on the mesonotum, and more laterally outstretched, forward-facing legs. They are uncommon, but dozens of genera occur worldwide, and over 200 species."
"They are found near fast-flowing streams where the larvae live. Blepharicerid larvae are filter feeders and have suckers on their abdominal sternites, used to adhere to rocks in the torrents in which they live. These suckers are sometimes called creeping welts. These are of unique evolutionary origin within the Diptera."
"One recent classification based largely on fossils treats this family as the sole member of its infraorder, but this has not gained wide acceptance."

"The album did not include the hit ""Out of Your Mind"", but spawned two singles, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" and ""A Mind of Its Own"" which managed to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom."
"""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" was released on 17 September 2001 as the lead single from the album. In the United Kingdom, the single faced competition in a hugely hyped chart battle with Kylie Minogue's single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". On the chart date of 29 September 2001, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart with first week sales of 35,000 units, while ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" debuted at number one with first week sales of 306,000 units. It has sold about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001. It sold 36,000 copies in its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001."
"The music video has a futuristic theme and features two Victorias: one dressed in all-white with blonde hair (""the good girl""), and the other in all-black with jet black hair (""the bad girl""). The video culminates into a ""dance-off"" and motorcycle race between the two Victorias. The complex video was shot almost entirely on a green set with a great deal of post-production, making it one of the most complex solo Spice Girl videos to date."
"""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002 as the second single from her debut self-titled solo album (2001). It peaked and debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and sold 56,570 becoming the 173rd best seller of 2002. There is a French version of the song called ""Mon Coeur N'en Fait Qu'a Sa Tete"" (an adaptation of the title into French, or ""my heart does what it wants to do"")."
"A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on ""Friday Night's All Wright"". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,; but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: ""No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue."""
"""Victoria Beckham"" faced a chart battle during the album's release week with Kylie Minogue's ""Fever"". Both singers had previously faced a battle in the singles' chart, when their singles were released on the same day. However, Beckham's album debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on 13 October 2001, whilst Minogue's album topped the charts. ""Victoria Beckham"" charted for three weeks on the chart. However, the album has only sold 50,000 copies overall in the United Kingdom, while costing £5 million to produce. After ""Being Victoria Beckham"", an official documentary that aired in March 2002, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number sixty-seven."
"Upon its release, the album received mixed to negative reviews. The BBC Music described the album as ""a mish-mash affair of gushy sentiment and wishy-washy RnB"" whilst ""NME"" called the album ""a new low in shameless pop slaggery""."
"Credits adapted from the liner notes of ""Victoria Beckham""."

The same night, TNA Triple Crown winner Chris Sabin turned heel when he felt Manik didn't show proper respect to him for his accomplishments. He additionally insulted fellow Triple Crown winner Austin Aries. On September 26, 2013, Manik defeated Sabin in a title match, but after the defense, Sabin attacked Manik until Aries came to save him. On the October 3 edition of Impact Wrestling, Jeff Hardy and Manik defeated Kenny King and Chris Sabin in a tag team match. Afterwards, Sabin attacked Hardy and Manik.

"At No Surrender, Roode was defeated by Magnus in the semi-finals of their Bound for Glory Series match. The same night, Roode and his stable, The Extraordinary Gentleman's Organization (EGO) interfered in the finals, attacking Magnus and AJ Styles. The next week, EGO attacked Magnus. On the October 3, 2013 edition of ""Impact Wrestling"", Magnus faced EGO in a 3-on-1 Gauntlet match, prevailing over Christopher Daniels and Kazarian but lost to Roode, giving EGO the victory. Afterwards, Sting attempted to console Magnus, who was expressing his frustrations of losing the Bound For Glory Series. Magnus accused Sting of not understanding his frustrations due to accomplishing so much in his career. Sting responded by challenging Magnus at Bound For Glory."
"On the October 10 edition of ""Impact Wrestling"", Daniels and Kazarian announced Bobby Roode's induction into the ""EGO Hall of Fame"", which led to a Roode diatribe about how he should have been selected for the actual TNA Hall of Fame instead of Kurt Angle. Angle then returned after an extended hiatus, fought off all three members of EGO and challenged Roode to a match at Bound For Glory. The following week, Angle stated his discontentment with Roode mocking his Hall of Fame induction and told Roode he would make him tap out. Roode responded by attacking Angle with help from his faction, EGO, forcing Angle to submit to the crossface hold in a precursory act prior to their match."
"On the October 3 edition of ""Impact Wrestling"", Velvet Sky and Brooke were supposed to have a number one contenders match, however Lei'D Tapa made her debut and attacked Sky.

On the October 17th edition of ""Impact Wrestling"", Robbie E defeated Hernandez, Christopher Daniels and Eric Young in a four-way match to get the advantage of the last position (4th). This meant that they entered the match last."
"TNA President, Dixie Carter, announced a rematch for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after the event. On the October 24, 2013 ""Impact Wrestling"" episode, Styles defeated Ray to retain the World Title. After the match, Carter, who had opposed Styles, had a change of heart and offered a new, lucrative contract to Styles; however, Styles refused to accept the contract due to his spite for Carter and left the company with the title. Carter vacated the title and began a World Title Tournament the following week, although Styles proceeded without authorization to defend the title belt in various international promotions."
"Mike Johnson, from PWInsider, said that the main event was ""Really good, hard hitting, well told story here. Easily the best thing on the show and a really good main event."" However, he criticized the Magnus-Sting due to ""The idea here was to make Magnus by having Sting lose clean in a back and forth contest. On paper, it made sense but the match didn't feel like it had the spark needed for that sort of moment"". Also, described Ethan's debut as ""pitch-perfect"". He described the entire show as ""It was just a show - some good, some eh, but Bound for Glory should never be just a show, it's their Wrestlemania, except this year, it wasn't."" Pat McNeill, from PWTorch, said Bound for Glory ""Wasn't a great event"". Bob Kapur, from CANOE Slam, said that he enjoyed the event overall. Also, Matthew Asher, from CANOE too, enjoyed the PPV but said the ultimate success of this Bound for Glory rests on the future storylines this event sets up."
= = = Museum Building (Trinity College Dublin) = = =
"The Museum Building is a building within Trinity College. Finished in 1857 and located on the south of New Square, it is home to the University's Geology, Geography, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering departments. It is a Palazzo style building, inspired by Byzantine architecture of Venice, and finished in Lombardo−Romanesque detailing, with over highly decorated 108 carved capitals."
"In 1833 the then Board of the College instigated a competition for a new Museum Building to contain the geological and various other collections which were housed within the large room of Regents House. Tenders were invited for almost twenty years, ending with the design submitted by Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward being accepted in April 1853. At the time however a row with John McCurdy had caused some concerns to the Board."
"On 23 May 1853 a contract for foundations was agreed with Messrs Cockburn & Son builders (for £24,000) and ground was broken some months later. It was during this time that Samuel Haughton (Professor of Geology) undertook an investigation into the suitability of the site due to its close proximity to the Old Library. He reported various layers of made ground, ash pits and calcareous drift, finally deeming the site permissible to build upon."
"The exterior of the building was fully in place by 1855; however, it was not until 1857 that the interior was completed and the building as a whole finished."
"Suitably fitting for a building designed to house a Geology collection, the Museum Building was constructed from a vast number of different and contrasting forms of stone. College tradition holds that it some form of stone from every quarry in Ireland during the time of its construction was used somewhere within the building."
"The exterior walls were first constructed from Calp Limestone, which were then faced with 22.86 cm (9 inches) of Ballyknockan Granite. The quoins, columns and 108 capitals, as well as the string course which can be seen halfway up the building, are all of Portland stone from the Isle of Portland, Dorset. The tympanum over the heavy wooden main door to building and which bears the crest of the College (a popular 19th-century variant, slightly different from the one currently used by the college today) is of Caen stone from Caen, France. Overall the exterior amounted to just under half the cost for the entire building."
"Initially Deane and Woodward had planned for the interior walls to be of rubble which would then be plastered over. However, in early 1855 they submitted a design change to the Board, deciding instead to use Caen Stone, and the Board agreed. However, when they had learnt that only two thirds of the stone had arrived the Board rescinded this permission. After strong argument from Deane, on 4 May they Board overruled their prior decision and agreed to the use of Caen Stone."
"The large domed central hall once again makes heavy use of Irish stone. The Romanesque arches between each column use alternating yellow and red stained blocks which sit upon bases and capitals of heavily carved Portland Stone. The central staircase and floors of the upper balconies are also made of Portland Stone. The original floor was composed of Yorkstone flagstones, further Portland Stone, Welsh Ffestiniog stone, with black squares of black slate, however this floor later relaid."
"The main entrance hall of the building houses fourteen full columns and eighteen half-column made of Irish Marble, although the only true marble is Connemara Serpentine. There had been some problems sourcing the materials needed to have every column complete, which after more petitioning from Deane resulted in the half columns. The only non-Irish stone used in the columns is a dark red Serpentine from Ruan Minor, The Lizard peninsula area of Cornwall."
The known stone from which the columns are made of include:
"Some of the interior room designs by Deane and Woodward were never realised, as the official college architect John McCurdy had convinced the Board otherwise."
"The entirety of the building's carvings are by brothers John and James O'Shea of O'Shea and Whelan who gathered wild flowers to use as models from the college's botanical garden near Ballsbridge. There are seven carvings that relate specifically to Aesop's Fables, and one (considered to be the most important) which refers to Charles Darwin and Evolution."
"College records from May 1860 mention of how the smoggy atmosphere had adversely affected the stone. After years of laying behind sooty deposits the ashlar of the building had become obscured. In 2010 a three-year conservation programme of the Museum Building was begun. Once finished in March 2013, many of the carvings which were almost invisible had been restored to their past state."

"Sounds like Chicken also had rotation on the radio station Triple J, mainly with their double A-side single ""Take a Bullet to the Grave""/""El Chupanebre"" and their other single ""Global Domination""."
"After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution."
The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face.
"Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar)."
"Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, ""Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken""."
"Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, ""I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar"", produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J."
"In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never In Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing. It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases."
"It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ""...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor"" was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a ""brilliantly released debut album"", although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release."
"In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike ""Carcass"" Haydon (of Melbourne band ""The Knockabouts""), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, ""Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre"" through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it."
"On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007."
Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1.
"On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated..."
"""""We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision."""""
"Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited-edition compilation disk titled ""Death To The Crow"" to coincide with the tour."
"Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007."
The band's entire discography (except for Death To The Crow) was made available for free download on their website and on Jamendo
"In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP ""How To Hear"", two singles ""Like a Train"" and ""Spark the Fire"" and later the mini-album ""Rugged Are The Mountains""."
Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites.
"On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan-run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store. The show was held at Ding Dong Lounge and featured supports from Antiskeptic, The Ramshackle Army, Best Before, Payoff and more. The show sold out."
= = = Full Scale (band) = = =
"Full Scale (formerly known as Full Scale Deflection, later known as Full Scale Revolution) is an Australian alternative metal band that formed in Perth, Western Australia during 1998. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001."
"Full Scale released two extended plays; ""Black Arrows"" and ""White Arrows"" both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, ""Full Scale""."
"Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, ""Symptoms of Chaos"", on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music."
"Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, ""Black Arrows"" in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, ""White Arrows"" in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively."
"According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, ""the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors"". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, ""Full Scale"", on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE."
"Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006. Ox moved on to a new group, Mammal."
"In January 2016 Ox and Tee announced that they were reforming the band with a new rhythm section of Chris Webber (Webbsy) and Leigh Miller. They announced February 2016 tour dates in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth."
"The band released a new song entitled ""Jurassic Graveyard"" in January 2018, and embarked on a national tour of Australia. So far, no new album has yet been announced."
"After Full Scale, Ox became the front man for Mammal, from March 2006, they released an EP, ""Mammal"". Their single ""Slaves"" was produced by Ox's ex-bandmate Savell. They later released two albums ("""" and ""The Majority"") and disbanded in 2009. He was the front-man of The Ox & the Fury with Brennan, Lucius Borich and Dom Italiano, as an alternate country music group. Ox also appeared in theatre, and produced music for hip hop groups. Ox later became the front man of Over-Reactor (based in Melbourne), which released their album, ""Lose Your Delusion""."
"Kaay became an author and entrepreneur. He used the business management skills he had acquired to build Full Scale into the band that was signed to Columbia Records to start his own Australian company. Right after Full Scale, he joined Sunk Loto in September 2006, until they broke up in December 2007. After that he worked with the Brown brothers for nearly two years on an unreleased project tentatively entitled, ""The Flood The Flood"". Deciding to retire from the live-music-touring scene in 2008, Kaay released a series of books, ""Robkaay Journals. Vol. I, My Glorious Nightmare"" (2008), based on his recollections of his music career over a period of ten years. Vol. II followed in 2010 as ""This is what it's really like being in a band"". He has also written two fantasy fiction novels, ""Silverbirch: A Tear in the Fabric of the Night Sky""(2009) and Silverbirch: Fall of the Epicenter. His first Silverbirch novel cracked the Top 10 Amazon.com chart in its first week of release in the Science Fiction category.

= = = Rolf McPherson = = =
"Dr. Rolf Potter Kennedy McPherson (March 23, 1913 – May 21, 2009) was the pastor of Angelus Temple and president of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, serving in that capacity from 1944 to 1988. By his retirement, the evangelical Pentecostal denomination had grown from 29,000 members in 410 churches to 1.2 million members in more than 19,000 churches located in 63 countries."
"Rolf McPherson was born on March 23, 1913 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Harold Stewart McPherson and Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. He was the half-brother of Roberta Star Semple, the daughter of Aimee and her first husband Robert James Semple, who had died of malaria one month before the birth of his daughter. Rolf and his sister Roberta were part of many services and revivals when young. McPherson attended college, first studying engineering. He switched to religion in 1930 after his mother became ill, and also completed divinity school, earning a doctorate."
"McPherson began his career as a preacher. His mother groomed him to take over Foursquare after a management dispute resulted in Roberta being ousted from church leadership. After his mother's death in 1944, and for the next 44 years, McPherson led the denomination, headquartered at Angelus Temple, and brought it into the evangelical mainstream, which supported its tremendous development in the United States and expansion internationally."
"He retired in 1988. After retirement, he continued to attend church every week, serving in congregational ministry. He resigned from all church duties in 1997. He died on May 21, 2009, at his home in Los Feliz at age 96, having been predeceased by his first wife, Lorna Dee Smith McPherson. His second wife and widow, Evangeline Otto Carmichael, was the ex-wife of composer Ralph Carmichael."
= = = 1891 Atlantic hurricane season = = =
"The 1891 Atlantic hurricane season ran through the summer and the early winter of 1891. The season had ten tropical cyclones, seven of which became hurricanes including one which became a major Category 3 hurricane. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. The tracks of four of the ten known 1891 Atlantic cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas. Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurrice database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity."
"A tropical storm formed in Gulf of Mexico northwest of Campeche on July 3. By the evening of July 6 it was approaching the coastline of Texas and had become a Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall just west of Galveston and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. It dissipated near the Alabama-Tennessee state line two days later after further weakening to a tropical depression. Sections of Galveston were flooded by a storm surge. At Baton Rouge, tornados related to the hurricane demolished a hundred homes and caused two floors of the state penitentiary to collapse killing ten prisoners."
"A tropical storm formed south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 17 and travelled on a northwesterly path before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on August 29 without making a landfall. For the majority of this period it is believed to have been a minimal Category 1 hurricane based on readings taken at Bermuda, which it passed on August 27, the capsizing of a steamer, the ""Dunsmurry"" on August 29 and observations from another ship, ""La Touraine"", which ran into the rough seas left in the hurricane's wake on August 30 and 31st."
The Martinique Hurricane of 1891 or Hurricane San Magín of 1891
"A Category 2 hurricane with winds of was first seen at mid-day on August 18 about east of Barbados. The hurricane tracked northwestward at , and grew to a major Category 3 hurricane. That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four hours. The hurricane killed more than 700 people alone in Martinique. After reaching its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, becoming a Category 2 storm early on August 20. That evening it passed to the south of Puerto Rico. Sustained winds were measured at 100-105 mph. As it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on August 21, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around midnight when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind was blowing southerly, and steady rain was falling on the island."
"The hurricane continued to weaken whilst traveling northeastward through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm passed directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. From August 23, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the, now Category 1, storm recurving to the north. Instead, it passed over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on August 25."
"On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbours around Martinque were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris. In total, the death toll from this hurricane was put at 700. In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler."
On September 2 a tropical storm formed northeast of the Leeward Islands. It began moving northwestward and reached category 2 hurricane strength by September 4. By September 7 the cyclone was off the coast of New England and was bringing heavy rain to that area. When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland on September 8 it destroyed a number of small vessels but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on September 10.
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 19°N 47°W on September 16, before developing into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. This hurricane never made landfall but did pass within 100 km of Bermuda on the night of September 21. A ship was reported wrecked on the coast of the island that night. The hurricane became an extratropical storm on September 26 in the mid-Atlantic off Nova Scotia."
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 21°N 54°W on September 29. It moved northwestward becoming first a Category 1 hurricane then, October 3 a Category 2 hurricane. At this strength it passed to the south, then to the west, of Bermuda on October 4. It quickly weakened as it continued heading north and was already an extratropical storm when it made landfall in Nova Scotia on October 6.

"Odette Valery (spelled Valéry in French publications), née Helene Vasilardi, (1883–?) was an Italian dancer of Greek parentage. She made her début at La Scala in 1898 at the age of fifteen. She moved to Paris where she danced with the Ballet Excelsior at the Folies Bergère. She came to regard dancing ""en pointe"" as ""old-fashioned"" and made her name doing reconstructions of ancient Greek dances in bare feet. Later she portrayed Cleopatra and did an Egyptian dance with a live asp. She was well-educated and spoke French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as some English and she played the piano well. In 1908, she caused a sensation in New York when she danced in the last act of ""Samson and Delilah"" at the Manhattan Opera House where she had been engaged by Oscar Hammerstein I. Her dance included the participation of one of three snakes (with fangs removed) which were cared for by their own groom, Robert, whom she had engaged in addition to other servants who travelled with her. In 1910 she was earning $1000 a week when dancing in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. She owned several automobiles and amassed a fortune in jewellery. She spent lavishly and by 1912, she was destitute. Her money ran out when she had to have an operation and as a result she could not work for an extended period. Although her weekly salary was what a workman earned in a year at the time, she hadn't saved a penny. She was found ill and starving in a cheap boarding house in Notting Hill, London where she was being cared for by her seven-year-old son Gaeton. She had been surviving thus for a year by pawning her jewellery. She was found by a friend who was performing at Hammerstein's London Opera House. The friend took her in and was planning to send her back to her home in France to recover. She returned to Paris and although she was reputed to have had twenty-eight love affairs in one year at the height of her fame, she had few real friends and continued to live in poverty. It was a California heiress, Mrs. Jackson Gouraud, who came to her aid on reading about her plight and gave a fund-raising ball in her honour at Martin's, New York.

"Vladimir Monomakh () was an armoured cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1880s. The vessel was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev. She spent most of her career in the Far East, although the ship was in the Baltic Sea when the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron and participated in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was tasked to protect the Russian transports and was not heavily engaged during the daylight portion of the battle. The ship was torpedoed during the night and was scuttled the following morning by her captain to prevent her capture by the Japanese."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was classified as a semi-armored frigate and was an improved version of the preceding . The ship was designed with high endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider able to outrun enemy battleships. She was laid out as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a ram and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. The ship's hull was subdivided by ten transverse bulkheads and she had a double bottom deep. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at deep load."
"The ship had two vertical compound steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, manganese-bronze propeller. Steam was provided by six cylindrical boilers at a pressure of . The engines produced during sea trials which gave the ship a maximum speed around . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" carried of coal which gave her an economical range of at a speed of . She was ship rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of . To reduce drag while under sail, her funnels were retractable."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was armed with four guns, one at each corner of the battery that were sponsoned out over the sides of the hull. Eight of the dozen guns were mounted between the eight-inch guns in the central battery and the remaining four were outside the battery at the ends of the ship. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by four 9-pounder and ten Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with three above-water torpedo tubes."
"The ship's waterline belt was composed of compound armour and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to at the ship's ends. It extended above the waterline and below. Transverse bulkheads thick protected the guns in the battery from raking fire. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective deck was thick."
"Construction began on ""Vladimir Monomakh"" on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel to be laid down in the ""Dmitri Donskoy"" class, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time of completion. The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev."
"On 11 October 1884, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" began a leisurely voyage from the Baltic Sea to the Far East. She made port visits in Kristiansand, Norway and Portland Harbour, England before reaching Malta on 25 November. The ship spent most of the next six weeks in Greek waters before arriving at Port Said, Egypt on 12 January 1885 to transit the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" encountered the British ironclad battleship there and was followed by her all the way to Japan as tensions were rising between Great Britain and Russia in early 1885. The ship arrived in Nagasaki in March 1885 and was appointed flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet under Rear Admiral A.E. Kroun. Based out of Vladivostok, she normally wintered in warmer waters. For example, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" visited Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, Batavia, Dutch East Indies and Penang Island between November 1885 and March 1886. She returned to Kronstadt in 1887 and was refitted in 1888."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" departed Kronstadt for the Mediterranean on 6 November 1889 where she remained for the next year. She joined the official escort for the Tsarevich Nicholas II’s visit to the Far East. The Tsarevich travelled aboard the and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" provided protection. The two ships reached Singapore on 2 March 1891, and reached Vladivostok on 23 May. Once at Vladivostok, Captain Oskar Stark was appointed commander of the ship and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was overhauled through August. She wintered over again at Nagasaki, departing for Europe on 23 April 1892 and reached Kronstadt in August, where the ship was given a thorough refit beginning on 22 September. The heavy sailing rig was replaced by three signal masts, her funnels were fixed in place, and her boilers were also upgraded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was reclassified as a 1st Class Cruiser on 13 February 1892."
"On 2 October 1894 the ship, now under the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron reinforce the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese treaty port of Chefoo on 16 April and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained at Chefoo until late in the year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to Kobe, Japan in January 1896."
The ship only remained there for a short time before she was ordered back to Kronstadt for a major modernization. Her obsolete 8-inch and 6-inch guns were replaced with five new 45-calibre 6-inch and six Canet guns. The ship's six original boilers were replaced by a dozen cylindrical boilers.
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet in November 1897 and reached Nagasaki in February 1898. After the Triple Intervention expelled the Japanese from Port Arthur, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was part of the Russian force which subsequently occupied that strategic harbor. In June 1900, she transported troops involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. In September 1900, on her return to Port Arthur, she accidentally rammed and sank the merchant vessel ""Crown of Aragon"". In December 1901, she rendezvoused with ""Dmitri Donskoy"" at Hong Kong, and the two ships returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained in the Mediterranean until August 1902, and reached Kronstadt in October. In 1903–04 some of her Hotchkiss guns were replaced by ."
"In February 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron, which was sent to reinforce Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's Second Pacific Squadron. The Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 14 May 1905 where they was assigned to the Cruiser Division commanded by Rear Admiral Oskar Enkvist."
"At the decisive Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was positioned to the right side of the Russian line of battle, guarding the transports and so avoided the pounding that the other vessels of Second Pacific Squadron received, although she engaged the Japanese cruiser . The Japanese ship was hit several times and driven off, but only three crewmen were killed and seven wounded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was hit several times itself and had one 120 mm gun destroyed and its crew killed. The most dangerous hit was a shell that burst over a 6-inch shell hoist and started an ammunition fire. The prompt flooding of the magazine averted an explosion."
"At nightfall, the Japanese torpedo boats engaged the surviving Russian warships and the cruiser claimed to have sunk one of her attackers at 8:25 p.m. ""Vladimir Monomakh"", mistaking one of her attackers for a Russian destroyer, was hit around 8:40 by a single torpedo which ruptured her hull near the No. 2 coal bunker, but sank the torpedo boat. The damage was severe but her crew kept her afloat and her engines operational, although she continued to take on water. The next morning, however, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" headed towards Tsushima Island and began to unload her wounded into her surviving boats. Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popov gave the order to abandon ship, and ordered the seacocks to be opened to scuttle the vessel rather than surrender it to the Japanese. The ship sank at 10:20 a.m. and the crew was captured by the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was officially removed from the navy list on 28 September 1905."

"Agathe is a successful art dealer who lives with her husband François and their son Adrien in a wealthy quarter of Paris. Adrien is an underachiever at his school and Agathe fights any disadvantages that this can bring for him in parent-teacher conferences. François is more of a reserved person and procrastinates on a construction project. The situation gets stirred up when Adrien's friend Patrick, who is Tony's father, enters the picture. Tony is brilliant in his studies irrespective of his poor access to amenities, so Agathe has a soft spot for the child. And, Adrien's test results seem to be getting better. But Patrick has a rather dubious social background. He lacks both tact in social situations and a proper home or job for supporting a family. Agathe is distressed by Patrick's unpolished behavior and his intrusion into their life. Her husband François hires him to take care of the overdue construction project and they become friends. Then François cajoles a woman Patrick had wanted for himself and leaves Agathe. Patrick and Agathe are left back with the children. Agathe develops a sense of attachment for this unruly man who, ""au contraire"" to her husband, empathizes with her and is dedicated to ensuring his son can attend a respected school. But Patrick fails continuously to become responsible and they break up. Some time later they reconnect because each seems to complete the other."

"Saint John's Episcopal Church in Jersey City, New Jersey is located on Summit Avenue in Bergen Hill. Owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, it is considered a masterwork of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture. The building, which has fallen into disrepair, became a municipal landmark in 2013."
"Erected in 1870, the Gothic Revival-influenced building was designed by John Remson Onderdonk, a local architect and practitioner of the ecclesiological philosophy, and is considered to be a masterpiece of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture by the city's landmarks conservancy. Its façade replicates a portion of the Chartres Cathedral in Southern France. Once housing the largest Episcopal church congregation in New Jersey, among its members were many of the leading citizens of Jersey City. It was called the ""Millionaire's Church"". In 1914, much of the church was damaged by fire, but was elaborately restored. By the mid-twentieth century, reflecting the demographic change in the city, its congregation became more working class. From 1960 to 1968 the church was a center of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements during the rectorship of the Reverend Robert W. Castle who preached a social gospel and drew attention to the plight of the city's poor. The church has not housed an Episcopal congregation since 1994."
"The Bergen Hill Historic District, of which the church is a contributing property, was established as a municipal historic district in 1986 and identified in New Jersey's state historic preservation office (SHPO) in 1989/1991 (ID#1481). In 2008, the SHPO issued a certificate of eligibility (ID#4986) for listing individually on both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. Attempts made in 2007/2008 to have the church designated a local landmark were unsuccessful, the motion having been tabled by the Jersey City City Council. When it appeared that the diocese was moving to demolish the building, a campaign was begun to convince the city council to re-visit the issue which it did in June 2013 and adopted a measure granting landmark status."
St. John's has not been in regular use since 1994. In 2004 Preservation New Jersey named St. John's one of the most endangered historic sites in the state.
"There is concern that if the building continues to deteriorate it will be necessary for it is to be demolished. The Jersey Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group, believes that the Episcopal Diocese of Newark has intentionally neglected the building in order to demolish it. The stained glass windows, altar, and other items were removed in 1997. In January 2012, the church's altar was offered for sale on e-bay. The diocese maintains that the preservation of the building is too costly and that no serious offers to purchase it have been forthcoming. In March 2013 the City of Jersey City served the diocese a Notice of Unsafe Structure, after which it contracted an asbestos abatement work and applied for a permit for demolition. Its designation as a local landmark requires that special approval be given before the building can be razed. The diocese disagrees with the landmarking. In 2015 it was decided to convert the property to residental spaces, including consruction of new buildings and conversion of the church."

"After the Bandcamp controversy, Rotny and Jon posted on the official Psyclon Nine Facebook page that both had quit the band due to Nero disappearing again, stating they felt he was irresponsible. Jon left a very apologetic letter to the fans on his personal Facebook page, explaining again how he and Rotny had nothing to do with the Bandcamp donations."
"On March 30, 2014, Nero Bellum explained on his personal Facebook page that he was in therapy and was unable to send out the Bandcamp orders. Due to Rotny and Jon quitting the band and other misunderstandings, Nero felt it was time to put an end to Psyclon Nine, canceling their European tour."

= = = Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos = = =
"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 3 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer."
"""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) ""America's Funniest Home Videos:"" viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the ""funniest"" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show."
"The producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience."
"It differed from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""'s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"The show followed the same structure of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as ""The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently."" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"Trenary placed 5th in her first senior national championships in 1986. Later that summer she won the U.S. Olympic Festival. In fall 1986 she placed second to Elizabeth Manley at the St. Ivel International. At the U.S. championships in 1987, she finished second in both the compulsory figures and short program, where she landed a triple flip jump for the first time in her combination. In the long program Trenary landed four clean triple jumps, including the triple flip, and she upset reigning world champion Debi Thomas to take her first senior national title. At the 1987 World Championships, she rallied from 11th in the compulsory figures to place fourth in the short program, again landing the triple flip jump in combination, and fifth in the long program, to place 7th overall. In 1988, Thomas regained the U.S. title, with Trenary finishing second. Trenary placed 4th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. She was 5th at the 1988 World Championships, where she fell on the triple flip in both her short and long programs. Due to her strength in compulsory figures, Trenary again won the U.S. Championships in 1989, although she was defeated by Kristi Yamaguchi in the free skating. Trenary won bronze at the 1989 World Championships."
"In 1990, Trenary won both the U.S. and World titles. Her strength in the compulsory figures was the deciding factor at the 1990 World Championships. She was 5th in the short program and second in the free skate to Midori Ito but her top placement in the figures kept her in the lead overall. The International Skating Union eliminated figures after that season. After she won her World title, her coach, Carlo Fassi, returned to live in his home country, Italy, and Trenary began working with Kathy Casey."
"Trenary's triple jumps included the toe loop, salchow, and flip, which was quite competitive for a female singles skater in the mid-to-late 1980s. One of her signature moves was a combination of a one-foot axel into a triple salchow."
"In January 1991, Trenary underwent surgery to drain her ankle after she developed a staph infection. As a result, she withdrew from the 1991 U.S. Championships. In March 1991, Trenary moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to work with Carol Heiss Jenkins."
"With the elimination of compulsory figures—formerly Trenary's strength—from competition, the technical standard for jumping in women's skating had risen greatly, with the top skaters all attempting five or six different triples. Trenary's injury was slow to heal and she had problems regaining her former standard of jumps, much less learning new ones. She planned to compete at the 1992 U.S. Championships, beginning her comeback in fall 1991 at Skate Canada, where she finished second in the short program to Surya Bonaly, but dropped to fourth overall after the long program, where she was unable to successfully land any triple jumps. She qualified for the 1992 U.S. Nationals by winning the 1991 Midwestern Sectional Championships with an uneven performance: after a strong short program in which she landed a triple flip combination, she was unable to land any triple jumps in the long program. She ended her bid to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1991."
"After turning professional, Trenary toured with the Tom Collins Tour of Champions and Stars on Ice for several years. Prior to the 1993 World Championships, the eventual winner and soon-to-be Olympic champion, Oksana Baiul, cited Trenary as her favorite skater for her beauty and style. Although Trenary's early professional competitive career was uneven, in 1996 she skated particularly strong programs, choreographed by her then-husband, Christopher Dean, to George Winston's ""Variations on a Theme by Pachelbel"", and to Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin' as part of the U.S. team in its victory over the world team in Ice Wars."
Trenary retired from skating in 1997 after developing a life-threatening blood clot in her shoulder.
"Trenary married British ice dancer Christopher Dean on October 15, 1994. They have two sons, Jack Robert and Sam Colin. Dean's agent confirmed in March 2010 the couple had separated."
= = = Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 = = =
"The Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 was an outbreak of tornadoes that occurred primarily in southern Wisconsin on August 18, 2005. A system of storms unleashed a total of 28 tornadoes, 27 of which were confirmed in southern Wisconsin, and 1 confirmed in Minnesota. This outbreak set a new record for the most tornadoes observed in the state in a single day, breaking the previous record of 24 tornadoes set on May 8, 1988. The system generating the Stoughton tornado was also accompanied by many reports of severe winds and hail throughout the region. The Stoughton tornado was documented on an episode of The Weather Channel's ""Storm Stories""."
"By far the most significant tornado of the day developed 2.0 miles (3.2 km) north of Oregon at 6:15 p.m.. This large, intense multiple-vortex tornado tracked 20.0 miles (32.2 km) into Jefferson County from Dane County, devastating the town of Stoughton."
"East of Oregon the tornado tore through several farms before impacting residential subdivisions in Stoughton. One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor. Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton. As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed. As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Several vehicles were flipped and tossed as well. Some homes in town were completely leveled, and an F4 rating was considered. Further investigation revealed that the homes were not well-built, and the slow (sometimes nearly stationary) forward movement of the tornado negated a rating higher than F3. After striking Stoughton, the tornado caused damage to trees and crops north of Busseyville before dissipating. Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha. 23 people were injured."
"Ten years later to the day, three tornadoes touched down outside of Lake Geneva, Big Bend, and Waukesha. There were no injuries or fatalities from those tornadoes."

"My Fellow Americans is a 1996 American comedy film starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner as feuding ex-presidents. Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford and Jeff Yagher are also in the cast. It is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people."
"Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to costar. Health problems kept him from appearing so Garner was chosen to star opposite Lemmon for their first project together."
"Republican Senator Russell Kramer of Ohio (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival Democratic Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), defeats Douglas. His Vice President, Ted Matthews (John Heard), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce."
"Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about ""Olympia"", codename for a series of bribes from defense contractor Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur (Bradley Whitford) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation."
"NSA agent Colonel Paul Tanner (Everett McGill) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to Camp David at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes."
"Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's Presidential Library in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), a Fox News journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents."
"They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the White House Executive Chef Rita (Esther Rolle) and make it to the Executive Residence only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by Secret Service Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming (Jeff Yagher), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them."
"Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances. The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison."
"Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as independents in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer."
"Most of the principal filming for the film was done in the mountains of western North Carolina. Scenes were filmed along the Broad River where it flows into Lake Lure in Rutherford County, Dillsboro, along the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad; Waynesville, where a giant clown sign crashes through their windshield as they try to flee and where they find the baby in the stolen car is in Marshall, North Carolina; and in Asheville, at the Biltmore Estate."
"In Asheville, North Carolina, the downtown area stands in for an unnamed town in West Virginia. There, the Western Carolina University Marching Band portrays the ""All Dorothy Marching Band"" (a fictional group based upon gay icon Judy Garland's character in ""The Wizard of Oz""), at a gay pride parade."
"In his memoirs, Garner wrote that he enjoyed working with Lemmon but felt the director ""was a self appointed genius who didn't know his ass from second case and Jack and I both knew it."""
The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10.
"Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" praised the performances of Lemmon and Garner but felt the movie was ""a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities"". However, he said that ""a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno. This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments."" James Berardinelli of ""ReelViews"" also complimented the actors, writing ""Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles"" and saying the movie has ""some good one-liners"", but he criticized the ""failed attempts to inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into the story"" and also felt the political satire was ""weak and obligatory"". Mick LaSalle of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" described ""My Fellow Americans"" as a ""pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script."""

"The ""Washington Post"" reported that Zelalem became a U.S. citizen on December 29, 2014, and that Zelalem had applied for an expedited U.S. passport. After Zelalem received his citizenship, Sunil Gulati, head of U.S. Soccer, revealed that the board for U.S. Soccer had started the process to allow Zelalem to become eligible to play for the U.S. national team. Due to a FIFA rule designed to prevent players from naturalizing to and representing nations to which they lack ties, Zelalem was subject to waiting a minimum of five years before he could start to represent the United States. Gulati stated U.S. Soccer filed for an exception, since Zelalem attended middle school in the United States. He was approved to play for the United States and was added to the United States squad for the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup on May 13, 2015. He made his debut against Australia in a U-20 friendly match on May 19, 2015, which the United States won 2–1."
"Before becoming an American citizen, Zelalem had previously played for Germany's youth teams. He played for Germany's under-15 and under-16 sides, making two appearances for the under-15s and eight appearances for the under-16s. In November 2013, Zelalem represented Germany at under-17 level in a friendly versus Spain. But in March 2014, he withdrew from the Germany under-17 national team for the Group 5 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite round fixtures, and again turned down the Germany under-18 national team for friendly matches versus France in March 2015, citing his desire to represent the United States instead."
"Prior to making his one-time switch to the United States, Zelalem was eligible to represent Ethiopia internationally, due to his parents' nationality. In October 2013, Ethiopia's coach Sewnet Bishaw and Ethiopian foreign minister Tedros Adhanom stated that they hoped Zelalem would opt to play for Ethiopia, but Zelalem turned down the opportunity."

"Nema aviona za Zagreb (""There Is No Plane to Zagreb"") is a 2012 Dutch film by Louis van Gasteren. The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's ""Basic Instinct""."
"In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, ""I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible."" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, ""I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room)."""
"The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white."
"The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings."
"As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when ""anything was possible."" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not."
"We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a ""Fat Lady"" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds."
"From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day."
"The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" (""There is no plane to Zagreb"" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. ""What ""Nema"" expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ""Nema"" and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark."" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth."
"He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use."
"Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God."
"First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did."
"From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English."
"At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, ""a little angel of God."""
"At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film."
"In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute."
"The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word ""nema,"" as ""Really and Sincerely"" by the Bee Gees plays."
"On January 6, 1864, Union Colonel J. B. Rogers, reported that ""Williams Guerillas"" were operating near Scatterville."
"On May 21, 1864, Captain H. J. Huiskamp of the Sixth Missouri Cavalry, (Union) reported, ""On our return, and while in camp near Scatterville, Ark., Captain Johns was shot by guerrillas, a ball passing through and shattering his left arm. He was also wounded in the hip."" ."
"On March 5, 1864, Union Captain T. W. Leeper reported that Confederate Col S. G. Kitchens was at Scatterville and ""has returned from General Price and ordered all these scattered bands to report to him, and that they have gone."""
"In June 1864, Union Brigadier General Ewing reported that Confederate Col Kitchens was at Scatterville with 300 men and that he was still recruiting."
"Union Col. John T. Burris reported a skirmish at Scatterville on July 7, 1864 with Bolin's Band and Kitchen's men. Burris reported the casualties as 4 Confederate dead and 1 Union wounded."
"Union Col John T Burris, of the 10th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry reported that a skirmish occurred at Scatterville which resulted in the burning of houses in Scatterville. Burris had under his command a battalion of the Second Cavalry, Missouri Militia, a detachment of the 1st Missouri Voluntee Cavalry and a detachment of the First Cavalry Missouri Volunteers. Burris indicates that his command reached Scatterville on 28 July 1864 and"
"There we routed a rebel recruiting party, under Colonel Clark, and had a skirmish with Bolins guerrillas. We killed 1 rebel lieutenant, took Captain Lineback prisoner, captured some arms and horses, and burned the houses, under cover of which the guerrillas had fired on my command. No casualties on our side, except the wounding of E. T. Jenkins, chief scout"
"As there are no known structures surviving from that period in the Scatterville vicinity, the Scatterville Cemetery is locally significant as the best surviving link to this important early Clay County settlement which faded from view in the post-railroad era. The Scatterville Cemetery comprises roughly two acres and is set in an impressive stand of largely oak and hickory trees. The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973."
"Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved. The inscriptions on many gravestones have been obscured by age and the elements while others were never inscribed. There are a few styled markers, including two four-sided family monuments with obelisks belonging to the Allen and McNiel families. Both were damaged by vandals; the Allen monument has been repaired, while the McNiel obelisk is lying in two parts beside its base. Nearby, the largest gravestone in the cemetery, the square-based, shaft and capital monument to Nancy McNiel, is in worse condition with its shaft lying on the ground and its capital broken into several pieces. There is also a multiple gravestone for three members of the Cook family. It is a tall rectangular monument with an upper-sloped face featuring a sculpted open Bible. Other interesting stones include H. W. Granade's 1870 horizontal cylindrical marker and Captain W. T. Morris's 1902 rectangular monument on base with an open Bible and a knotted stole draped down one side."
"Although there is an unsubstantiated story regarding a grave in the southeast corner in which twenty Civil War soldiers are buried, there is no mention of slaves being buried here. It is known that some are buried at the nearby Mobley family cemetery."
The only non-historic component of the cemetery is a dedication marker of pink granite atop a concrete base that is inscribed:
"""The privilege of caring for this forest shrine was accepted by the Methodist Youth Fellowship of Rector in 1963. We bequeath its perpetual care to our successors."""
= = = Milky Way (mythology) = = =
"There are many myths and legends about the origin of the Milky Way, the crowd of stars that makes a distinctive bright streak across the night sky."
"Ancient Armenian mythology called the Milky Way the ""Straw Thief's Way"". According to legend, the god Vahagn stole some straw from the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along the way."
"The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way."
"A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (""Gili Ulisvsdanvyi"") ""Where the dog ran""."
"Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the ""Silvery River"" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the ""Seventh Night"" (, and )."
"In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor)."
"Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called ""The Pathway of the Birds"" (, ). The Finns observed that migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed ""Lintukoto"" (bird home) was."
"In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Ukko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter."
"The name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, )."
"In the Babylonian epic poem ""Enûma Eliš"", the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted."
"The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας ""Galaxias"") is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, ""gala""). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way."
"Another version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way."
"A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the ""Poeticon astronomicon"" (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), or Opis, the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way."
"In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called ""śiśumãra cakra"", the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called ""Akasaganga"" which means ""The Ganges River of the Sky""."
"According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk)."
"In Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was ""Bealach na Bó Finne"" — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as ""the Great Silver Yoke"" and the ""White Marrow of Fedlimid,"" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (""Mór-Chuing Argait"", ""Smir Find Fedlimthi"")."
Other names include:
"The Chinatown stop is located on George Street, north of Campbell Street. It is named after Sydney's Chinatown precinct. The Capitol Square stop on the Dulwich Hill Line is nearby. The design was to include two side platforms, but was changed to an island platform in the project's Submissions Report. The location was also moved 15 metres north."
"The Haymarket stop, known as Rawson Place during development, serves as an interchange for buses heading towards the west via Broadway. The design includes two side platforms for trams and an adjacent platform for buses, which allows bus – tram cross-platform transfers."
"The Central Chalmers Street stop is located on Chalmers Street, serving the eastern side of the Central railway station precinct. The stop was originally known simply as Central during development, but was renamed to distinguish it from the existing Central stop on the Dulwich Hill Line at the station's Grand Concourse. The new stop consists of one side platform and one island platform."
"The stop was originally proposed to consist of three double length (90 metre) platforms, with one of the platforms to only be used during special events - the roadway being open to general traffic at other times. This third platform was removed in the project's Submissions Report, with a crossover to the north of the stop provided instead. The Report also proposed diverting most general traffic via Randle Street and converting the section of Chalmers Street opposite the station into a pedestrian/traffic shared zone. As a result of the December 2014 decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during special events at Moore Park were abandoned. Consequently, the Modifications Report reduced the platform length from 90 metres to 75 metres. The third platform was reinstated in an urban design plan released in 2017. This report also proposed closing Chalmers Street to through traffic."
"The Surry Hills stop is located on Devonshire Street, adjacent to Ward Park in Surry Hills. The design originally featured an island platform but was changed to side platforms in the project's Submissions Report. Groundwork for a second Surry Hills stop at Wimbo Park for a potential future station if required will be completed in the initial construction phase."
"The Moore Park stop serves the Moore Park precinct. In regular service the stop serves Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School and The Entertainment Quarter. The stop is also designed to handle major events at the New Sydney Football Stadium and Sydney Cricket Ground, with grade separated access to the platform. At-grade access to the stop will be provided for regular use and for disabled passengers during major events. The design features a 75-metre island platform."
"The stop's design experienced a number of modifications. Initially, an overhead concourse was proposed for access to the stop during special events with at-grade access at other times. School students would have used the existing footpath and pedestrian crossing of Anzac Parade."
"In the project's Submissions Report, the stop was moved 250 metres south and a pedestrian bridge over Anzac Parade and the light rail tracks was included in the design, replacing an existing at-grade crossing of the road and an associated set of traffic lights. The bridge was to be connected to the concourse. In December 2014, the overhead concourse was removed, with underground access for major events provided at both ends of the platform. At-grade access will be used by disabled passengers during major events and by all passengers at other times. The bridge will now be a separate structure. As a result of the decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during major events were abandoned. Consequently, the platform length was reduced from 90 metres to 75 metres."
"Community submissions responding to the changes in the Modifications Report raised concerns about the safety of a large number of school students crossing the tracks during peak schools hours. In response, TfNSW stated that it will consider opening the subways during these hours. A condition of approval for the changes proposed in the Modifications Report requires the preparation of ""a safety case demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, that schoolchildren can safely access the Moore Park stop during peak school start and finish times""."
"Royal Randwick, known as Alison Road and then Royal Randwick Racecourse during development, is located on existing park land adjacent to Centennial Park on Alison Road, opposite the racecourse. This required the construction of a new retaining wall approximately 200 metres long and three metres high together with increasing the height of an existing 1,100-metre long levee by up to 300 millimetres and the removal of approximately 50 established trees."
"The design features an island platform. The proposed location was switched from the south side to the north side of Alison Road in December 2014. This is intended to reduce impacts on the racecourse, improve bus access during major events and provide better access to the nearby Centennial Park and Randwick TAFE. This change includes the removal of right turn access from Alison Road into Darley Road."
"The Wansey Road stop is located on Alison Road, adjacent to the intersection with Wansey Road. The design features an island platform and was originally to be located on Wansey Road itself, but was moved to Alison Road in the project's Submissions Report. The stop was originally proposed to be named Wansey Stables."
"The UNSW High Street stop serves the north-eastern part of the University of New South Wales campus. It was to have been located at the southern end of Wansey Road, adjacent to High Street, but was moved onto High Street itself as part of the project's Submissions Report. As part of the changes to the Randwick stop, the design was changed from an island platform to two side platforms."
"The Randwick stop is located the eastern end of High Street in Randwick. The stop was originally proposed to be named Randwick Junction. The design features an island platform. The site will be a major interchange between buses and light rail. Bus stops are proposed for Belmore Road, Avoca Street and Clara Street."
"The original design featured two side platforms located in High Cross Park adjacent to Belmore Road. This location attracted criticism from community members due to loss of trees and parkland. The stop was redesigned in the project's Submissions Report to reduce the loss of green space in the park, however a campaign to move the stop continued. Randwick City Council requested the stop be moved to High Street, outside the Prince of Wales Hospital and TfNSW ultimately agreed to do this. A location within High Cross Park was considered to provide the best interchanges between trams and buses."
"ES Marks, known as Carlton Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade south of the intersection with Carlton Street. The stop will serve a residential area. It is named after the nearby ES Marks Athletics Field. The design features an island platform."
"Kensington, known as Todman Avenue during development, will be located on Anzac Parade north of the intersection with Todman Avenue. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade in the suburb of Kensington. The design features an island platform."
"UNSW Anzac Parade serves the western part of the University of New South Wales campus and the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The design includes an island platform in the centre of Anzac Parade, north of the University Mall."
"The stop was to be located on the eastern side of Anzac Parade and include one island platform and one side platform – though only two tracks. In the project's Submissions Report, the side platform was removed and the stop was moved to the centre of Anzac Parade."
"The Kingsford stop, known as Strachan Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade to the south of the intersection of Strachan Street and Middle Street in Kingsford. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade. The design features an island platform."
"Juniors Kingsford, originally Nine Ways and known as Kingsford during development, will be located on the southern side of the Nine Ways intersection in Kingsford. The design features two island platforms with the light rail using the two outer platforms and buses using the two inner platforms, providing cross-platform transfers. Terminating facilities for trams are located south of the stop. In August 2018 TfNSW submitted a proposal with the Geographical Names Board for the stop to be renamed from Nine Ways to Juniors Kingsford which was approved in January 2019."
"In 2014, TfNSW investigated an extension along the southern Anzac Parade corridor. Three potential options were examined; a 1.9 kilometre extension to Maroubra Junction, a 5.1 kilometre extension to Malabar and an 8.2 kilometre extension to La Perouse. An extension to Maroubra Junction has the support of Randwick City Council."

"The Yeshiva College, also known as the Harry O. Triguboff Centre, is a Hasidic Jewish synagogue, learning centre, and library of the Chabad-Lubavitch nusach, located at 36 Flood Street, in the Sydney suburb of Bondi, New South Wales, Australia. The Centre runs various adult and child-based educational programs."
The centre was established in 1956 by Abraham Rabinovitch and others. The leaders from 1956 to 1968 were Rabbi G. Hertz and Rabbi C. E. Barzel. In 1968 the Yeshiva's board of trustees appointed Rabbi Pinchus Feldman to lead its synagogue and to assist with expanding its small ultra-orthodox Jewish day school.
"Our Big Kitchen, a charity established by Yeshiva Sydney in 2005, operates from the Yeshiva."
"In February 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard Rabbi Yossi Feldman testify, where he stated that he ""was not aware it was illegal to touch a child's genitals"". Feldman told the Commission that he did not find it necessary for victims to report sexual abuse to the police if offences took place decades prior. He proposed that the law be lenient on sexual predators who had not committed any sexual abuse for two decades if they had repented. His comments outraged the Australian Jewish community, and victims of sexual harassment called for him to stand down. Rabbi Yossi Feldman stood down from his administrative positions at the Yeshiva Centre."
"Due to their negligent handling of sex abuse in the Centre, survivor advocate, Manny Waks, placed the centre on his wall of shame."
The Royal Commission issued a case study on Yeshiva educational facilities in Sydney and Melbourne. The Commission reported that:
"The Yeshiva Gedolah Rabbinical College, like other Chabad Yeshivot Gedolot, provides education and training to young men seeking ordination as rabbis. Established in 1986 by the Yeshiva Centre, it forms part of the Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva network. Rabbi Boruch Lesches served as its Rosh Yeshiva and Mashpia for almost twenty years. He has since left Sydney, and is currently serving as the rabbi of the Chabad-Lubavitch shul in Monsey, New York, which also contains a Yeshiva that is part of the Tomchei Temimim network."
"The Yeshiva Gedolah was administered by Rabbi Yossi Feldman, a son of the Chabad Emissary for New South Wales, Head Rabbi and spiritual leader for Chabad-Lubavitch, New South Wales, Pinchus Feldman, until February 2015 when, following Rabbi Yossi Feldman's evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies labelled his views repugnant and declared him to be ""unfit to hold any position of authority or leadership in the Jewish community""."
"Yeshiva College was a Jewish day school, established by the Yeshiva Centre in 1956. From 1968 to 2003 it was headed by Rabbi Pinchus Feldman. After financial difficulty, in late 2003 the Feldman family ceded control over the school to philanthropist Meir Moss for 1. The school later rebranded as Kesser Torah. In 2007 the Yeshiva opened a new school called Cheder Chabad Lubavitch, later renamed Yeshiva College Bondi Ltd."
= = = Ayds = = =
"Ayds (pronounced as ""aids"") Reducing Plan Candy was an appetite-suppressant candy that enjoyed strong sales in the 1970s and early 1980s and was originally manufactured by The Campana Company. It was available in chocolate, chocolate mint, butterscotch, and caramel flavors, and later a peanut butter flavor was introduced. The original packaging used the phrase ""Ayds Reducing Plan vitamin and mineral Candy""; a later version used the phrase ""appetite suppressant candy"". The active ingredient was originally benzocaine, presumably to reduce the sense of taste to reduce eating, later changed in the candy (as reported by ""The New York Times"") to phenylpropanolamine."
"By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease. While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market."
The product was introduced by the Carlay Company of Chicago. A U.S. trademark was registered in 1946 claiming first use in commerce was in 1937.
"In 1944, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission objected to the claim that the product could cause the user to ""lose up to 10 pounds in 5 days, without dieting or exercising""."
"The Carlay Company later became a division of Campana Corporation of Batavia, Illinois. Then Campana bought Allied Laboratories of Kansas City in 1956. Thereafter, Campana was bought by Dow Chemical and its president, Irving Willard Crull, was president of Dow for less than six months, during which time he engineered the sale of Campana to Purex in the 1960s. He again become president of Campana while serving as a vice president of Purex, which allowed Campana to function as a separate division. Crull also relied on socialite and Hollywood friends like Bob Hope and his wife Dolores Hope, Tyrone Power and his wife Linda Christian, and others to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan Candy line. A ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine article in November 1956 reported that Crull had already recruited a number of his friends amongst socialite and Hollywood celebrities to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan weight-loss regimen."
"In 1981, Purex sold the rights to the Ayds name to Jeffrey Martin Inc. In 1987, Jeffrey Martin, Inc. and its product line (including Ayds Appetite Suppressant and Compoz Sleep Aid) were acquired by the Dep Corporation (sometimes written DEP)."

Currently, King is running a recording studio in Brooklyn, New York called Vinegar Hill Sound as well as doing part-time war photojournalism in places like Iraq and Afghanistan."
"King comes from a family well known in the wine business under the King Estate name. King attended O'Hara Catholic School from the first grade through the eighth grade. He later attended Marist High School before attending South Eugene High School. He dropped out of high school as a sophomore and entered the San Francisco Art Institute to study painting. He began playing drums and guitar around age 14 and wrote and performed songs with his current bassist, Drew Dresman. King began to focus on acoustic guitar at age 19, and in 1999 he released his self-titled album, followed by ""Opening"" in 2000. In 2001, after traveling through Europe, Ireland and Great Britain, King recorded ""Le Bleu""—an instrumental acoustic guitar record which featured long-time friends and James West on percussion, Troy Sicotte on bass and Linh Renken on violins. Le Bleu was recorded at Peter Gabriel's ""Real World Studios"" just outside Bath, England."
"Inspired by Real World Studios, King returned to the US and began construction on his own studio ""Blackberry Hill"". The studio took about two years to complete during which time King toured the country as a solo guitarist opening for James Taylor, BB King, Diana Krall, North Mississippi All-Stars, Al Green and others. Just after building Blackberry Hill King recorded another instrumental record, ""I-XII"", with James West, renowned bassist Michael Manring and European guitarist Carlos Vamos. Shortly after that King started a band with James West (later replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee), Troy Sicotte (later replaced by Drew Dresman), and Ehren Ebbage (later replaced by Chris Plank). The band toured the country for about one year before being signed to a major label record deal with Epic Records in 2006."
"The band recorded the self-titled ""Justin King and the Apologies"" record at King's Blackberry Hill studio as well as studios in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The recording process took more than a year during which time the band continued to tour extensively throughout the nation as well as some international performances. After a large shakeup at Epic Records in which the president and the band's A&R representative left the company the band stayed on in limbo with Epic for about one more year before requesting to be let go from the label. Epic gave the master recording rights to the band and the album was released independently by the band shortly thereafter. After touring tirelessly throughout the year the band broke up around the end of 2007."
"Since the disbanding of The Apologies, King has pursued an interest in photojournalism, having spent August 2008 in Iraq embedded with the Oregon National Guard at Balad Air Base. He accompanied the US military on patrols and raids as well as medevac missions and convoys. His photos appeared on the BBC's website and his stories were featured in Oregon's mainstream news publications."
"In 2001, King released ""Le Bleu"", which was a mostly instrumental album featuring only one track with vocals (""Ashes""). It dramatically showcased his skills on acoustic instruments, and although the album was independently released, it would receive critical acclaim. However, the biggest boom to his music career was the release of live videos on the Internet. The first, and most famous, was a clip of the credits from a documentary on Jean Larrivée guitars. In it, King plays an energetic, fast-paced version of ""Phunkdified,"" which served to introduce younger, web-savvy players to King's unique playing style. His live performance of ""Knock on Wood"" at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene introduced the Doolin double-neck acoustic guitar."
"Following the release of ""Le Bleu"", King began several new projects including an electronic remix of ""Le Bleu"" by the Raging Family, and another instrumental project with Carlos Vamos and Michael Manring. His primary focus, however, was a songwriting-based album. He assembled a new band with longtime friends Ehren Ebbage (lead guitar) and Drew Desman (bass). In 2005, drummer James West and was replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee. King's endeavor in rock music also features a return to playing piano on several songs. King's latest music maintains his complex musical style despite acquiring a more mainstream sound."
"On March 20, 2007, King and his band, after a long struggle, ended their contract with Sony BMG/Epic Records. The band felt that the label took away a considerable amount of freedom in deciding how the music should sound, as well as showing little interest in King's musical ambitions. The band released a five-song EP, ""Fall/Rise"", in spring 2007 before resuming touring, which included several performances in South Korea. The band's debut album, ""Justin King and The Apologies"", was released on September 28, 2007."
= = = Mortal Kombat: Conquest = = =
"Mortal Kombat: Conquest (stylized on-screen as Mortal Kombat: Konquest) is an American martial arts television series based on the ""Mortal Kombat"" fighting game series, which aired for one season, from 1998 to 1999. Set prior to the events of the first game, the series follows the original Kung Lao (Paolo Montalbán) as he protects Earthrealm with the help of warriors Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and Taja (Kristanna Loken)."
"Many centuries ago, Earth was an enchanting and desirable planet. Powerful and rich with natural resources, the vicious megalomaniac Shao Kahn wanted Earth as part of his growing collection of conquered realms known as Outworld. To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat was created: a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Kahn imprisoned Tsung in the cobalt mines."
"Kung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao created a partnership and friendship between two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Rayden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own."
"With ""Conquest"" immediately following TNT's top-rated program, ""WCW Monday Nitro"", WCW wrestlers Meng and Wrath filmed separate appearances. Former QVC model Dorian John played the barmaid Magda in the episodes ""Twisted Truth"" and ""Quan Chi."""
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the ""Mortal Kombat"" film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Television Distribution distributed the series. The program was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. The Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the ""Mortal Kombat"" property), as New Line's corporate sibling-turned-parent, syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, which aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats of the first-run syndication run. With a lucrative timeslot following ""WCW Monday Nitro"", ""Conquest"" was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the ""MK"" timeline."
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it enjoyed a more successful run on television. Unofficial collections produced in the UK consist of unrelated and edited episodes merged so that each disc contains a theme, and some of the DVDs contain spelling errors on the covers. Several episodes of the series, consisting of one show per disc, were released in Germany; two of the discs feature episodes centered around Kreeya and Sub-Zero. DVDs were also recently released in Portugal, with many spelling errors on the covers. In 2015, Warner Home Video released ""Mortal Kombat: Conquest - Season One"" on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time."
"In 2010, 4thletter! ranked ""Conquest"" as sixth on the list of ""The Top Ten Most Ridiculous Things to Come Out of Mortal Kombat"". In 2011, 1UP.com featured the series in the article ""The Top Ten Times Mortal Kombat Went Wrong"", calling it a ""wire-fu disaster""."
= = = Just'a Lotta Animals = = =
Just'a Lotta Animals is a fictional superhero team that appeared in stories published by DC Comics. The team is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody of the Justice League of America.
"Just'a Lotta Animals originally appeared in the series ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!"" as the name of a superhero comic book written and drawn by Captain Carrot's alter ego, Roger Rodney Rabbit. Various panels of the Just'a Lotta Animals' comic that were shown in the ""Captain Carrot"" series were often parodies of classic Justice League storylines. The team was in fact the original proposal by Zoo Crew creators Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw for a funny animal superhero series for DC, but DC's editor Dick Giordano asked them to create original characters instead. They agreed and created the Zoo Crew, but still ended up introducing the Just'a Lotta Animals team in the series."
"In ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew"" #14 and #15, in a storyline titled ""Crisis On Earth-C!,"" the Just'a Lotta Animals were finally revealed to actually exist, on a parallel Earth named ""Earth-C-Minus"" (as opposed to the world of the Zoo Crew, which was named ""Earth-C""). The two teams united to defeat the villains of the story, Dr. Hoot (an owl mad scientist) and Feline Faust (a cat sorcerer; an analog of Justice League villain Felix Faust)."
"The team's imagery was brought to life by a confused paranormal teenager in the second part of the ""Young Justice: World Without Grownups"" storyline."
"Just'a Lotta Animals lived on the parallel world of Earth-C-Minus, and made its headquarters in an orbiting satellite space station."
"Events and characters on Earth-C-Minus were considered to be fictional to natives of Earth-C, similar to how events and characters of Earth-Two were considered as fictional on Earth-One. Additionally, events and characters on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One. Like Earth-C, the names of characters and locations tended to make heavy use of various animal-based puns."
"After the events of the 1985 miniseries ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"", it was revealed that Earth-C-Minus (and Earth-C) survived intact, as they were actually ""alternate dimensions"" instead of parallel Earths, although the most recent mini-series ""Captain Carrot and the Final Ark"" has suggested that Earth-C is now also considered Earth-26, one of the new 52 parallel Earths in the new DC Multiverse."
The main members of Just'a Lotta Animals are:
Other members of Just'a Lotta Animals include:
Enemies of Just'a Lotta Animals or its individual members include:
"The Green Lambkin appeared as a member of the Green Lantern Corps in the Duck Dodgers episode ""The Green Loontern."" The rest of the Just'a Lotta Animals did not appear."
"The DC Nation block of programming on Cartoon Network features a variation on the Just'a Lotta Animals in Farm League (identified earlier as the Justice League of Animals). In the initial image released, some variations included Superman as a duck, Batman as a mosquito, Wonder Woman as a mouse, Green Lantern as a cat, Martian Manhunter as a vulture, Cyborg as a flea, B'wana Beast as a bear, Lex Luthor as a hairless monkey, Brainiac as a bull, etc. However, a subsequent preview from San Diego Comic-Con International instead revealed Superman as a manatee named Supermanatee, Batman as a mongoose named Batmongoose (voiced by Diedrich Bader), Wonder Woman as a wombat named Wonder Wombat, The Flash as a fish named The Flish, Green Lantern as a warthog named Green Lamprey, Aquaman as a mandrill named Aquamandrill, Captain Marvel/Billy Batson as a pig named Shazham!/Billy Bacon, Robin as Robin's Egg, Cyborg as a bug named Cybug, Darkseid as a duck named Duckseid, the Joker as a frog named the Croaker, Catwoman as a cat named Cat Cat, Mister Mxyzptlk as a chicken, Solomon Grundy as a rabbit named Solomon Grunny, Two-Face as a bull named Moo-Face, Bizarro as a dog named Bizarfo, Captain Cold as a cod fish named Captain Cod, Sinestro as a hippopotamus named Sinestropotamus, Lex Luthor as a bald-headed liger named Lex Liger, and Ambush Bug as a slug named Ambush Slug."
= = = Ipatiev House = = =
"Ipatiev House () was a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg (later renamed Sverdlovsk) where the former Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (1868–1918, reigned 1894–1917), his family, and members of his household were executed in July 1918 following the Bolshevik Revolution. Its name is identical to that of the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, from where the Romanovs came to the throne. As an act for the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolutions, it was demolished in 1977 by orders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the local communist soviet government, almost 59 years after the Romanov family execution and 14 years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1990–1991."
"In the 1880s, Ivan Redikortsev, an official involved in the mining industry, commissioned a two-story house to be built on the slope of a prominent hill. The length of the facade was 31 metres. In 1898, the mansion passed to Sharaviev, a gold dealer of tainted reputation. Ten years later, the house was acquired by Nikolai Nikolayevich Ipatiev, a military engineer, who turned the ground floor into his office."
"It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Pyotr Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Ural Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called ""The House of Special Purpose."""
"The Imperial Romanov family moved in on 30 April 1918 and spent 78 days at the house. This household included Tsar Nicholas Romanov, his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, their four daughters, their son and heir Alexei, the Tsarevich (crown prince); their court physician Dr. Yevgeny Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov, and valet Alexei Trupp. They occupied four rooms on the upper story of the Ipatiev House, while their guards were housed on the ground floor. From early July, command of this guard was taken over by Yakov Yurovsky, a senior member of the Ural Soviet."
"Until 2001, the Bundesliga was directly under the control German football's governing body the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association). This changed with the formation of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German Football League) when the Bundesligen came under the auspices of this new body. The DFL, while remaining subordinate to the DFB, manages Germany's professional leagues and is responsible for the issuing of licences to clubs, general fiscal oversight of the Bundesligen, and marketing rights for the two upper leagues."
"Since the launch of the Bundesliga on 24 August 1963 fifty-five clubs have played in the league ranks. To help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the league, two clubs with distinguished Bundesliga histories met in a game on 24 August 2003: Hamburger SV, once known as the ""dinosaur"" for being the only club which has played in every season of the league's existence until relegation in 2018, and Bayern Munich, the most successful side in German football, which had just won their seventeenth Bundesliga title."
"In 2005, German football was once again overshadowed by the discovery of a match-fixing scandal involving second division referee Robert Hoyzer, who confessed to fixing and betting on matches in the 2. Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the Regionalliga (III). The games included a DFB-Pokal first-round match between regional side Paderborn and Bundesliga heavyweights Hamburg on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost (2–4) through penalties and a red-card charged to the side and was eliminated from the lucrative competition."
"Hoyzer was banned for life and received a 29-month prison sentence. He soon implicated other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers, leading to an ongoing investigation. To this point, at the end of 2005, it appears that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions:"
"Despite the scandal, the Bundesliga continues to set new attendance records. In the Bundesliga's 43rd season, total attendance was about 12.41 million in 306 games for an average of 40,572 per game, a 6.9% increase over the preceding year, making the 2005–06 season the 5th consecutive record attendance year. After a decrease in 2006–07 and a slight recovery in 2007–08, new records were set in 2008–09, with 12.82 million total attendance and a per-game average of 41,904. The 2008–09 figure makes the Bundesliga the best-attended national football league in the world by per-game attendance. It is also third in per-game attendance among major professional sports leagues in the world, slightly ahead of the Australian Football League (Australian rules) and well behind the second-ranked Indian Premier League (Twenty20 cricket) and top-ranked NFL (American football) in the United States. Top drawing clubs based on average attendance included: Borussia Dortmund 72,850; FC Bayern Munich 67,214; FC Schalke 04 61,177; and Hamburger SV 53,298. Interest in the league was piqued by the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted in Germany. An ambitious program of stadium upgrades was undertaken in preparation for the tournament."
"The 2. Bundesliga saw an enormous increase in popularity in 2006–07, drawing about 4.67 million spectators for an average of 15,253. This not only smashed the league's previous attendance record, but also marked an increase of more than 20% over the 2005–06 season. The league saw another huge increase in popularity in 2007–08, drawing 5.55 million spectators for an average of 18,140, an increase of almost 19% over the previous season, which briefly made the 2. Bundesliga the most-attended second-level professional sports league in the world on a per-game basis. However, the league would lose almost all of these gains in 2008–09, with total attendance of 4.76 million and an average of 15,550. Although the Second Bundesliga is now second in attendance to England's Football League Championship among second-level professional sports leagues, it still draws more spectators per game than the top leagues in such established footballing nations as Turkey, Russia, and Portugal."
"Starting with the 2008–09 season, a new third-level league, the 3. Liga, was launched, slotting between the 2. Bundesliga and the Regionalliga in the league pyramid. Unlike the Bundesligen, the 3. Liga is operated directly by the DFB. At the same time, the Regionalliga went from two divisions to three."
"One of the problems currently facing the league is in the performance and fate of clubs from the former East Germany, which are finding it difficult to compete with the wealthy, established western sides. One-time GDR clubs are unable to attract lucrative sponsorships, cannot afford the salaries needed to hold on to their ""homegrown"" talent, and find themselves playing in crumbling or primitive stadium facilities. Of the 36 clubs in the top two levels of the league system in the 2011–12 season, five are from the former East Germany, an increase of two from 2010–11. However, as in the previous two seasons, none will be in the First Bundesliga. The five former Eastern clubs in the 2. Bundesliga are Energie Cottbus, who last appeared in the First Bundesliga in 2008–09; Union Berlin, from the former East Berlin, who have been in the 2. Bundesliga since being promoted as champions of the inaugural season of the 3. Liga; Erzgebirge Aue, present since the 2010–11 season; Hansa Rostock, who immediately returned from a one-season stint in the 3. Liga; and Dynamo Dresden, making their first appearance at the second level in five years. Four other eastern clubs are playing in the 2011–12 3. Liga—Carl Zeiss Jena, Chemnitz, Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and the Potsdam club Babelsberg."
"In preparations for the 2006 World Cup, the DFB attempted to fairly balance the number of venues between the eastern and western halves of the country. However, the organization had to face up to the reality of there not being enough suitable facilities in the old DDR –not limited to stadiums, but including hotels, restaurants and other visitor needs, and transportation infrastructure–, with the result that the east finds itself underrepresented. Only one of the 2006 venues was in the former East Germany (in Leipzig). Similarly, only one of the nine venues for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, also held in Germany, was in the former East Germany (in Dresden). The situation fits into the broader context of the effects of German reunification on East Germany and the resentment that many Ossis feel for their western cousins."
"RB Leipzig is one notable club that produced a major resurgence of football in the former East Germany. This club saw several successive promotions in a short period of time and gained promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016–17 season. The club's success has been controversial. RB Leipzig was founded by initiative of drink company Red Bull GmbH, whose involvement in the club has sparked new discussions about commercialism in professional football."
"The 2012–13 season saw FC Bayern Munich become the first club ever to achieve the treble by winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and European Cup."
"Bayern Munich made German football history even further by earning a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title in 2016, and eventually became the first German club to attain more than four championships in succession by winning their fifth and sixth titles in 2017 and 2018 respectively for the club's 27th league title and their 28th nationally, both new records."
"Meanwhile, after 55 seasons, Hamburger SV was relegated from the Bundesliga to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history. During the 2017–18 season, a final day win over Gladbach was not enough to escape the drop as Wolfsburg won against Cologne. Hamburg had to endure a disastrous season under various managers after surviving two playouts in the preceding four seasons."
= = = Mona Mahmudnizhad = = =
"Mona Mahmudnizhad (, September 10, 1965 – June 18, 1983) was an Iranian Baháʼí who, in 1983 (together with nine other Baháʼí women) was sentenced to death and hanged in Shiraz, Iran. She was accused of being a member of the Baháʼí Faith."
"The official charges ranged from ""misleading children and youth"", to being a ""Zionist"" (because the Baháʼí World Centre is located in Israel)."
The non profit Mona Foundation focusing on girl's education was named after her in 2001.
"Mahmudnizhad was born on September 10, 1965, to Yad'u'llah and Farkhundeh Mahmudnizhad (who had left their home in Iran to teach their religion in Yemen)."
"In 1969 the government of Yemen expelled all foreigners and the Mahmudnizhad family returned to Iran. They spent two years in Isfahan, six months in Kermanshah and three years in Tabriz before finally settling in Shiraz in 1974. During this time her father repaired small appliances for work and served the Baháʼí community as part of various Baháʼí administrative bodies."
"While Baháʼís regularly faced persecution in Iran, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 reinforced this further. At 7:30pm on October 23, 1982, four armed Revolutionary Guards, sent by the public prosecutor of Shiraz, entered the Mahmudnizhad household and ransacked the home in search of Baháʼí material. They then took Mona and her father into custody. The two were blindfolded and taken to Seppah prison in Shiraz, where they were placed in separate quarters; Mahmudnizhad was detained in Seppah prison for a total of 38 days."
"On November 29, 1982, she and five other Baháʼí women were transferred from Seppah prison to Adelabad prison (also in Shiraz). After some time in Abelabad, she was transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Court where she was interrogated and placed back in prison."
"A few days later, she was once again interrogated in front of an Islamic Revolutionary judge. After these series of interrogations, which involved physical torture by being whipped on the soles of her feet with a cable, Mahmudnizhad was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. At the time of her sentencing, President of the United States Ronald Reagan, made a plea for clemency; despite this, the sentence of the 10 women was carried out on the night of June 18, 1983, at a nearby polo field."
The other women who were hanged with Mahmudnizhad were:
"In September 2007, the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center published a case study on the subject."
"Mahmudnizhad's story is the subject of several art works. Music artist Doug Cameron recreated Mahmudnizhad's story in a music video, ""Mona with the Children"", which made the pop charts in Canada (#14 for the week of October 19, 1985). The video was distributed throughout the music scene and was effective in bringing the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran to international public attention."
"A play based on Mahmudnizhad's story titled ""A Dress for Mona"" has been produced and in 2008 Jack Lenz produced a film called ""Mona's Dream"". Her pictures are also featured in Mithaq Kazimi's Quenching The Light video."

= = = John Baker White (Virginia) = = =
"John Baker White (August 4, 1794 – October 9, 1862) was a 19th-century American military officer, lawyer, court clerk, and civil servant in the U.S. state of Virginia."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark."
"During the American Civil War, White was concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury."
White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759–1831) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833–1915) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839–1917).
"John Baker White was born on August 4, 1794, near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White (1759–1831) and his wife Arabella Baker. Among his other relations, White was a great-great-nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738–1804) and a great-nephew of another United States House Representative, Francis White (1761–1826)."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign."
"Following his service in the War of 1812, White settled in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814. On March 20, 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County, and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757."
"As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White conducted the teaching of jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P. White, and Philip B. Streit."
"In addition to his law instruction, White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society. When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1839, White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board ""occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability"", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats."
"By 1839, White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney. During the absence of the board's president, David Gibson, White served as president ""pro tempore"" from November 29 until December 13, 1839. The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White's tenure on its board of directors."
"Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E. M. Armstrong."
"White's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America, after which White supported the defense of Virginia's states' rights and of the United States Constitution. White's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army, and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause. Because of his Confederate sympathies, White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest."
"No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864, and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war. In 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White ""kept close watch over"" the county's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces. Later in the fall of 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney."
"Upon learning of this, White was again concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping. White selected for transport only the bound volumes of records which included ""deed books, wills, and settlements of estates"" and kept the unbound paper records in the courthouse, thus separating them so that the entirety of the county's records could not be destroyed by Union forces. White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records, as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together."
"In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed."
"Virginia City is a 1940 American Western film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Miriam Hopkins, Randolph Scott, and a mustachioed Humphrey Bogart in the role of the real-life outlaw John Murrell. Based on a screenplay by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Union officer who escapes from a Confederate prison and is sent to Virginia City from where his former prison commander is planning to send five million dollars in gold to Virginia to save the Confederacy. The film premiered in its namesake, Virginia City, Nevada. The film was shot in black and white (sepiatone)."
"Union officer Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) stages a daring escape from Confederate Libby Prison run by the commandant, Vance Irby (Randolph Scott). Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins), who unbeknownst to him is in fact a dance-hall entertainer — and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis (Charles Middleton) to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell (Humphrey Bogart), leader of a gang of ""banditos"", traveling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away."
"When the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town."
"While Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison."
"The rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery (Douglass Dumbrille), the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch."
"Bradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture."
"Drewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, ""as a soldier"", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but ""as a man"" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865."
"The day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln (Victor Kilian, seen only in silhouette) and pleads for Bradford's life. Lincoln reveals that at that very moment, Generals Lee and Grant are meeting at Appomattox Courthouse to end the war. As the war is over, and in a symbol of the reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln pardons Bradford in the spirit of his second inaugural address, ""With malice toward none; with charity for all..."""
"The film was a follow up to ""Dodge City"" although it has entirely new characters and was not a sequel, predating it by eight years in historical time. It was originally called ""Nevada"" and was to star basically the same director and cast as ""Dodge City"": Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Sheridan, Donald Crisp, Guinn Williams, and Alan Hale. The title was eventually changed to ""Virginia City"", which had been owned by RKO, but they agreed to give it to Warners."
"De Havilland dropped out and was replaced by Brenda Marshall. However, within a few weeks, Miriam Hopkins replaced her. Randolph Scott was hired to play Flynn's antagonist. Victor Jory was going to play the main villain, but had a scheduling conflict due to his appearance in ""Light of Western Stars"". He was replaced by Humphrey Bogart, requiring ""It All Came True"" to be pushed back."
"There was six weeks' filming based in Flagstaff, Arizona."
The film was given a gala premiere in Reno and Virginia City.
"Frank Nugent of ""The New York Times"", despite criticizing the acting talents of Flynn and Hopkins, wrote that ""there is enough concentrated action in [""Virginia City""], enough of the old-time Western sweep, to make it lively entertainment""."
"""Filmink"" magazine called it ""a big, expensive, noisy movie which aims for size and spectacle over, say, suspense and thrills – I don’t think director Michael Curtiz was any more excited by Westerns than Flynn, but both do professional jobs, as does Scott."""
"According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,518,000 domestically and $602,000 foreign."
"When the film was released in France in 1947, it became one of the most popular movies of the year."
= = = Irving Vendig = = =
"Irving Vendig (October 11, 1902 — January 7, 1995) was an American soap opera writer best known for creating ""The Edge of Night""."
"Born in the Mississippi city of Holly Springs, Vendig created ""The Edge of Night"" for Procter and Gamble Productions and CBS Daytime in 1956. He had been a writer on the ""Perry Mason"" radio show and when Erle Stanley Gardner refused to allow the show to become a soap opera, Vendig refashioned the show into ""The Edge of Night"", and brought actor John Larkin, who played Mason on the radio, to the show as series star Mike Karr. The character of Mike's daughter, Laurie Ann Karr, was named for Vendig's daughter Laurie Ann."
"Vendig was the series' head writer from 1956 until 1960, then co-head writer with James Gentile from 1960 until 1965. Vendig was credited on-air as series' creator until his departure from the daytime drama in 1965."
"He also created the NBC Daytime drama ""Three Steps to Heaven"". He also wrote for the daytime dramas ""Search for Tomorrow"" (which he wasn't able to see at his Florida home because the local CBS affiliate didn't carry it), ""Paradise Bay"" and ""The Clear Horizon"". He created ""Hidden Faces"", a short-lived drama for NBC, which was similar in theme to his more famous ""The Edge of Night"", which starred Stephen Joyce, Conard Fowkes, Louise Shaffer, Tony Lo Bianco and future Oscar nominee Linda Blair."
= = = Variable capacitor = = =
"A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors are often used in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners."
"In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed."
"The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (""rotor"") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (""stator"") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis. Air or plastic foils can be used as dielectric material."
"By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale. Various forms of reduction gear mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns."
"A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor, it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio, as well as high-powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced."
"On 23 October 2014, Connecting Sydney was announced as the preferred bidder. The contract was finalised in December 2014, when it was also announced that the consortium had been renamed ALTRAC Light Rail, and that the opening date had been brought forward to early 2019. The contract also included the operation and maintenance of the Inner West Light Rail from mid-2015."
"Major construction commenced on 23 October 2015, beginning in the section of George Street between King and Market Streets. To minimise disruption along the length of the corridor, works were staggered across 31 construction zones. The first section of track in the CBD was laid in December 2016, by which time a total of 410 metres of track had already been laid across the project. This increased to around 5 kilometres of track by May 2017. By October 2017, track installation reached the halfway mark, with 12,000 metres of track laid at 23 of the 31 zones along the alignment."
"The CBD and South East Light Rail required significant changes to the bus networks of the Sydney central business district and the Eastern Suburbs. Prior to construction of the light rail, Hillsbus and State Transit bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey."
"To accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including Elizabeth, Castlereagh, Park, Druitt, Clarence and York Streets. Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as Railway Square, Queen Victoria Building and King Street Wharf. A small number of routes were either combined so that they run through the CBD without terminating, removed from the CBD entirely or completely discontinued."
"Construction suffered from significant delays. Major construction of the project was due to conclude in April 2018, though finishing works were to continue for some time after."
"Delays at two zones in the CBD were announced in August 2016. Originally meant to be completed before Christmas 2016, construction work at these zones was to continue for several months longer than originally anticipated. The zones were eventually opened around a year after the planned completion date. Further delays to the project arose during 2016."
"By the beginning of 2018 the whole project was significantly behind schedule. In March 2018 – one month before major works were originally due to be completed – the Transport Minister declined to put a date on when he expected construction of the line to be finished, but noted the government was ""an unhappy customer"" of the ALTRAC consortium."
The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure – the construction company delivering the line – had deteriorated with a dispute arising between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design. Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion. Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020.
"In October 2018, Acciona announced further delays to the project, stating that it would not be completed until May 2020."
"In June 2019, TfNSW and ALTRAC (including Acciona) reached an agreement to resolve their commercial issues and legal claims. As part of the agreement, the PPP was extended to 2036, with the government to pay up to $576 million over the duration of an extended PPP term, and ALTRAC shareholders to invest additional equity into the project to meet costs. The settlement package resolved over $1.5 billion of legal claims between TfNSW and ALTRAC, and Acciona withdrew its $1.1 billion legal misrepresentation claim against the government. The agreement also included milestone and incentive payments for light rail services to commence in two stages, with target start dates of December 2019 between Randwick and Circular Quay, and March 2020 between Kingsford and Circular Quay."
"Separate to the light rail budget, Randwick City Council earmarked $68 million to partially mitigate the impacts of the light rail. Projects include replacing some of the car parking spaces that were lost, especially in Kingsford, works to improve traffic flow in the district and public domain works."
"The City of Sydney planned to provide $220 million towards the light rail project. This would include money for public domain works on George Street and surrounding laneways. The centrepiece of these works was to be a large arch structure known as Cloud Arch located outside the Sydney Town Hall, however it was cancelled in late 2018 after cost blowouts. Cloud Arch would have acted as a gateway to the pedestrian section of George Street, with trams passing underneath it."
"In February 2018, testing of the line commenced on a short section of the Randwick branch along Alison Road. Testing along the rest of the Randwick branch and the main line to Circular Quay was achieved in August 2019, while the Kingsford branch, which will open three months later than the rest of the line, commenced testing in October 2019."
There have been criticism of the project from some parties:
"The first L2 passenger service between Circular Quay and Randwick commenced just after 10 AM on 14 December 2019. The opening weekend (14 and 15 December 2019) was fare-free, and 115,000 people used the new tram service during the opening weekend. The launch of the service on 14 December was interrupted by a tram which broke down at Circular Quay around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, within hours of the official opening ceremony. Services were restored by 3:30 PM."
"L3 passenger services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford will commence in March 2020. In the interim until then, to maintain the frequency of light rail services in the CBD, L2 services run between Circular Quay and Central Chalmers Street. When the Kingsford branch opens, these services are expected to continue beyond Central Chalmers Street towards Juniors Kingsford as L3 services."
"The project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) released in 2013 proposed a redesigned bus network in the CBD and the Eastern Suburbs. Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted. Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the University of New South Wales to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus."
The proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:
"Some bus changes had been made to bus routes in the list since 2013. For example, route 343 currently runs as a through route between Kingsford and Chatswood without terminating at the CBD, and UNSW routes had been reconfigured as bus routes 891, 893 and 898."
The final bus network will be announced in due time and changes to bus services will be implemented four to six weeks after the commencement of L3 Kingsford Line services in March 2020.
"As a member of the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium, Transdev will operate the line until the end of the PPP, set to end at 2036. Services on the Randwick branch are numbered L2 and services on the Kingsford branch are numbered L3."
"The service is operated by 60 five-section Alstom Citadis X05 trams operating in coupled pairs. The first was completed in May 2017, arriving at the Randwick depot on 28 July 2017."
"The line commences outside Circular Quay station heading west on Alfred Street, before proceeding south down George Street, then east via Rawson Place and Eddy Avenue, and south via Chalmers Street to Central station. It then continues east via Devonshire Street over the Eastern Distributor and under Moore Park and Anzac Parade via a tunnel before heading south via the former bus right of way. At the intersection of Anzac Parade and Alison Road the splits into two branches, L3 (to open in March 2020) continues down Anzac Parade to terminate outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club at Kingsford, and the L2 branch goes to Randwick via Alison Road, Wansey Road and High Street."

The line includes the following stops:
"The Circular Quay stop serves the locality of Circular Quay at the northern end of the Central Business District. The stop is on Alfred St between Pitt and Loftus Streets. The area has an established role as a transport interchange and is already served by buses, trains and ferries. The stop comprises one island platform and one side platform."
"The Bridge Street stop, known as Grosvenor Street during development, is located on George Street, near the intersections with Bridge Street and Grosvenor Street. The design includes an island platform. The design originally included two side platforms but was switched to an island platform to retain the existing dedicated left-hand turning lane from George Street into Grosvenor Street."
"The Wynyard stop serves the locality of Wynyard. The stop is located at the northern end of the George Street pedestrian zone, adjacent to the entrance to Wynyard railway station. The design includes two side platforms."
"The QVB stop, known as Queen Victoria Building during development, is located on George Street south of Market Street and adjacent to the Queen Victoria Building (often abbreviated QVB), a shopping centre from which the stop takes its name. The design includes two side platforms."
"The Town Hall stop is located at the southern end of the George Street pedestrian zone, adjacent to St Andrew's Cathedral. It is named after Town Hall railway station and the Sydney Town Hall. The stop will consist of two side platforms."
"In the design synthesis role (transformation of a hardware-design description into a gate-netlist), SystemVerilog adoption has been slow. Many design teams use design flows which involve multiple tools from different vendors.

= = = Boomer Sooner = = =
"""Boomer Sooner"" is the fight song for the University of Oklahoma (OU). The lyrics were written in 1905 by Arthur M. Alden, an OU student and son of a local jeweler in Norman. The tune is taken from ""Boola Boola"", the fight song of Yale University (which was itself borrowed from an 1898 song called ""La Hoola Boola"" by Robert Allen (Bob) Cole and Billy Johnson). A year later, an additional section was appended, borrowed from the University of North Carolina's ""I'm a Tar Heel Born""."
"The phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" refers to the Land Run of 1889, in which the land around the modern university was settled. ""Boomers"" were people who campaigned for the lands to be opened (or tried to enter the lands) before passage of the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889. ""Sooners"" were land thieves who settled before the lands were officially opened, giving them an unfair advantage on finding, fencing, and claiming farm land. If the charge of early entry was proven, they would lose their claimed land."
"The OU marching band plays the fight song when the team takes the field and when the team scores a touchdown, a field goal, makes a big play, or makes a play in general. They also play it along with other fight songs while the Oklahoma defense is on the field to encourage the crowd to get loud. Some fans have informally counted it being played between 70 and 90 times a game."
"ESPN writer Doug Ward has called the combined effect of ""Boomer Sooner"" and OU's horse-drawn Sooner Schooner wagon ""as potent a one-two fight song/mascot punch as you'll find in college football."""
"On October 15, 1983 the University of Oklahoma football team visited Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Sooner squad played poorly at first, and within 10 minutes Oklahoma State was winning by a score of 20-3. A policeman escorted Gene Thrailkill, the Oklahoma band director, off the field for not having a sideline pass. Before he was forced to leave, Thrailkill shouted to the band members, ""I want you to start playing and don't stop 'til the team's ahead!"" The band complied, and played ""Boomer Sooner"" non-stop roughly 300 times. The team responded by scoring 15 unanswered points against Oklahoma State. After an OSU fumble with 1:17 left in the game, Oklahoma scored a field goal to win 21-20. OU coach Barry Switzer awarded the game ball to the band (known as ""The Pride of Oklahoma"") for the non-stop effort and labeled it ""The Day The Pride Won""."
"AEW commentator and Oklahoma native Jim Ross uses the fight song as his entrance theme. He also often uses the phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" to signify a good moment."
"In recent years, ""Boomer Sooner"" has been adopted as a chant at Sooner football and basketball games. One side of Owen Field or the Lloyd Noble Center chants ""Boomer!"" with the other side chanting ""Sooner!"" The chant has frequently been heard at recent Heisman Trophy presentations, led by 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims."
"The tune of the song is also used for Albania's popular national song, ""Shqipëri, atdhe i dashur!"" (""Albania, dear fatherland!""), also known as the Alphabet Hymn. The tune was borrowed by Parashqevi Qiriazi, who penned patriotic lyrics to fit it, after the historic Congress of Manastir which decided the Albanian alphabet."

Lawrence M. Tanenbaum (born 1945) is a Canadian businessman and chairman of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). He owns a 25% stake in MLSE through his holding company Kilmer Sports Inc.
"Tanenbaum was born to a Jewish family, son of Max (owner of York Steel) and Anne Tanenbaum. and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Cornell University in 1968."
"The family's patriarch, Abraham Tanenbaum, left Parczew, Poland, north of Lublin, for New York in 1911. Two Toronto-bound friends from the same town persuaded Abraham to join them. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Abraham was driving a horse and cart through residential and industrial areas of Toronto looking for scrap metal. By 1914, just before the war in Europe, Abraham had saved enough to bring his wife, Chippa Sura, and two young sons Joseph and Max to accompany him in Toronto. Abraham prospered and constructed the Runnymede Iron and Steel Company into a major steel fabrication company and real estate empire. His son, Max, who founded his own company, York Steel, had seven children, among them Larry, who studied economics at Cornell University."
"Tanenbaum is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as president and CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction, Kilmer developed into a multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer's road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer's wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited."
"Tanenbaum served as chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada's largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren's activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America's largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As a result of this merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the board and chaired its finance committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA."
"Today, Kilmer's roots in construction are expressed through innovative real estate development and leading edge public private partnerships (P3). Its Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund reclaims contaminated land in the urban context, through sophisticated risk management and optimizing for highest and best use. Its Kilmer Developments is currently managing three P3's: The Quickload Container Examination Facility in Prince Rupert, B.C.; the 20 Ontario Highway Service Centre locations under the ONroute banner, in partnership with HMS Host and Canadian Tire; and in partnership with Dream, designed, financed and constructed the 2015 Pan Am Games Athletes’ Village, which has been converted into condominiums as part of the Canary District Project. Kilmer is also part of the consortium that has acquired the passenger terminal operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport."
"Kilmer has a long history of private equity investment, beginning in 1975 as a significant shareholder of CUC Broadcasting, where Tanenbaum served on the board of directors and the executive committee of the company. At the time of its sale in 1994 CUC was Canada's fifth largest cable company, with operations that included paging, publishing, satellite, and radio broadcasting."
"Most recently, Kilmer, in partnership with Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling out of Kansas, acquired the Coca-Cola bottling and distribution operations for all of Canada. The new operation, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, is owned by Tanbridge Partners LP, of which Tanenbaum is co-chairman."
"Kilmer's other current private equity investments include Chaleur Sawmills Limited Partnership, Fornebu Lumber Company Inc. and Cypress Five Star Inc., the Canadian franchisee of Five Guys Burgers and Blaze Pizza."
"In addition to its direct investing activities, in 2000 Kilmer founded Kilmer Capital Partners Limited, a private equity investment fund manager, which established two funds to provide equity capital to small and mid-market companies. Tanenbaum is chairman of Kilmer Capital. Kilmer Capital's investments have included Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp., McGregor Industries Inc., Unisync Corp. Inc., Vansco Electronics Ltd., Atelka Enterprises Inc., Altasciences Inc., Compact Power Inc. and Tribal Sportswear."
"Tanenbaum recently served as a member of the advisory council, Toronto Board of Trade. He also served as a member of the Ontario Investment and Trade Advisory Council; as a member of the advisory committee, Toronto Prosperity Initiative; and as a member of the independent fiscal review panel of the City of Toronto; and the Mayor's Economic Competitiveness Advisory Committee of the City of Toronto."
"Tanenbaum has had a long-standing interest in the sports and entertainment area and to that end in 1991 he spearheaded the effort to bring an NBA franchise to Toronto. In 1996 an interest was acquired in the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and arena.

"The controller itself is shaped like an ""M"" (similar to a Gamecube controller). Players hold onto the sides of the controller and the part that dips down in the middle contains the battery pack. There are six buttons on the controller (A, B, Start, Select, L, and R), two D-pads, and the system's ""on/off"" switch. The two directional pads are located on either side of the controller at the top. The ""A"" and ""B"" buttons are located below the pad on the right side and the ""Start"" and ""Select"" buttons are located in the same spot on the left side. What would normally be called ""shoulder buttons"" (""L"" and ""R"") are located behind the area where the pads are, on the back of the controller, functioning more as triggers."
"In more traditional 2-dimensional games, the two directional pads are interchangeable. For others with a more 3D environment, like ""Red Alarm"", ""3D Tetris"", or ""Teleroboxer"", each pad controls a different feature. The symmetry of the controller also allows left-handed gamers to reverse the controls (similar to the Atari Lynx)."
"One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back. It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system. This can be substituted with a wall adapter, though a ""slide on"" attachment is required for the switchout. Once the slide on adapter is installed, a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power."
"During development, Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play. The system's EXT (extension) port, located on the underside of the system below the controller port, was never officially supported since no ""official"" multiplayer games were ever published, nor was an official link cable released. (Although ""Waterworld"" and ""Faceball"" were going to use the EXT port for multiplayer play, the multiplayer features in the former were removed and the latter was canceled.)"

= = = Nintendo 64 technical specifications = = =
"This article describes the processor, memory, and other components of the 1996 Nintendo 64 home video game console. It then goes on to explain the specs of the Nintendo 64's components in more detail, and details the sub components therein."
"The Nintendo 64's central processing unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300, a licensed variant of the 64-bit MIPS Technologies R4300i, itself a cost-reduced derivative of the MIPS R4200. Built by NEC on a 350 nm process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16 KB for instructions, 8 KB for data). Although a floating-point unit exists as a logical coprocessor, there is no dedicated physical FPU datapath on the VR4300; instead, the integer pipeline is shared for this purpose, meaning that floating-point instructions will stall the pipeline. The 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"With a clock rate of 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 is generally considered to be the most powerful console CPU of the fifth generation of video game consoles. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retains the computational abilities of the 64-bit MIPS R4200, though few titles take advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game titles generally use faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these are sufficient to generate 3D scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space, which came at a premium with contemporary technology. The CPU is constrained by a 562.5 MB/s bus to the system RAM, and in order to access the RAM, the CPU must go through the Reality Coprocessor (RCP), and can not use DMA to do so as the RCP can. This issue is further compounded by the RDRAM's high access latency."
"Programs emulating the Nintendo 64 benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host. Most of these emulators perform the majority of calculations at 32-bit precision and trap the few subroutines that actually make use of 64-bit instructions."
"Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI coprocessor, named the Reality Coprocessor, or RCP. The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and the Reality Signal Processor (RSP). Each area communicates with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s of bandwidth. The RSP is a MIPS R4000-based 128-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing the chip's functions to be significantly altered by each software title if necessary, to allow for different types of work, precision, and workloads. A number of microcodes were provided by Nintendo, while a few companies, such as Rare and Factor 5, would later develop their own microcodes. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, and triangle setup. The Reality Display Processor is primarily the Nintendo 64's pixel rasterizer, and also handles the console's Z-buffer compute."
"The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen (who later founded ArtX in 1997). The RCP was manufactured by NEC, using its 350 nm 3LM CMOS process, which NEC had introduced in 1994. The processor contains 2.6million transistors manufactured using this process. The processor has a size of 81 mm², giving it a transistor density of over 32,000 per square mm."
"Instead of a discrete sound processor, the RSP frequently performs audio functions, although the CPU can be tasked with this as well. It can play back most types of audio (dependent on software codecs) including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is theoretically capable of a maximum of 100 channels of PCM at a time, but only in a case where all system resources are devoted to audio. It has a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. In practice, however, storage limitations caused by the ROM cartridge format limit the audio size and thus quality. Some game titles are designed for higher quality audio when storage expansions are available, as with ""F-Zero X Expansion Kit""."
"The RDP performs rasterization, converting images into raster format before output to the display. The RCP also provides the CPU's access to main system memory via a 562.5 MB/s bus. Unfortunately, this link does not allow direct memory access for the CPU. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"The final major component in the system is the random-access memory, or RAM. Following its design heritage in SGI supercomputing, the Nintendo 64 implemented a unified memory architecture (UMA), instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, as seen on its competitors. The RAM itself consists of 4.5 megabytes (0.5 MB for anti-aliasing) of Rambus RDRAM, fabricated by NEC. System RAM is expandable to a total of 9 MB with the Expansion Pak. The RAM has a 9-bit data bus at 250 MHz; as RDRAM transfers data at both the rising and falling edge of the signal (a technique also known as DDR), it provides the system with 562.5 MB/s peak bandwidth, shared between CPU and RCP."
"Rambus technology was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth at a relatively low cost. The narrow bus makes board design easier and cheaper than the higher width data buses required for high bandwidth out of slower-clocked RAM types (such as VRAM or EDO DRAM); this way, the N64 mainboard could be designed with only 2 layers. However, RDRAM, at the time, came with a very high access latency. The combination of high bandwidth and high latency meant that significant effort was required from developers to achieve optimal results. Early N64 revisions use two 18 Mbit RAM chips; in ca. 1998 these were replaced with a single 36 Mbit chip, same as was used on the Expansion Pak."
"The Nintendo 64 Game Pak ROM cartridges are much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers of many games, such as Nintendo EAD's ""Super Mario 64"" or Factor 5's ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine""."
"The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. This is accomplished through the proprietary ""MULTI OUT"" connector on the rear of the system, which was carried over from the SNES and later reused on the GameCube. Although the digital-to-analog converter chip used in early models had the capability to produce RGB video, it was not connected by default for this purpose, and later revisions lacked the pin connections for this purpose entirely."
"The system came bundled with a composite cable (labeled Stereo A/V cable by Nintendo). Available separately (and included with the system in the UK) were a RF modulator and switch set (for connection to older televisions) and an official S-Video cable, although the latter was only sold at retail stores in Japan. In the U.S., the official S-Video cable could only be ordered direct from Nintendo of America, while in PAL territories, no S-Video cable was officially sold altogether. Furthermore, Nintendo omitted several components from the S-Video signal path in PAL consoles, meaning that using an unmodified NTSC S-Video cable will result in an overbright, garish image, or no image at all."

= = = Coucher de soleil no. 1 = = =
"Coucher de soleil no. 1 (also called Landscape, Paysage, Landschap, or Sunset No. 1) is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is a work executed in a mosaic-like Divisionist style with a Fauve palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory."
"""Coucher de soleil"" was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the Salon des Indépendants (n. 3457), along with ""Bacchante"" and four other works by Metzinger."
"The painting had been in the collection of Helene Kröller-Müller since 1921 or prior, now in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands."
"""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100 cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ""J.Metzinger"" (lower right), and titled on the verso ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"". Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships."
"The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond. The plants to the lower left resemble the agave, a species found in the south of France, Spain and Greece. ""Agave"" is also the name of three characters in Greek mythology:"
The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of public nudity propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.
"In this luscious setting—as in ""Luxe, Calme et Volupté"" by Henri Matisse—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the spectrum of visible light. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present."
"Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ""La danse (Bacchante)"" or ""Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape"": (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ""Two Nudes in a garden"", 91.4 x 63.8 cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ""Coucher de soleil no. 2"" or ""No. 3"", the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ""Landscape with Fountain"", for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6 cm; ""Paysage pointilliste"", 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73 cm; ""Matin au Parc Montsouris"", ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7 cm; or even ""La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil"", 54 x 73 cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905."
"Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began painting portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum."
"The Fauves (many of whom would become Cubists), were heavily influenced by Neo-Impressionism, calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the Impressionists. The Symbolists too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ""reflect"" light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet."
"Metzinger's response in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists."
"The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini."
"The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ""Sunset No. 1"". ""Neo-Impressionism"" wrote Paul Adam, ""wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction."""
"By ""abstract,"" writes Robert Herbert, ""writers and painters of the period did not mean ""devoid of reference to the real world"", as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ""idea"", and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue."""
"By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Cézanne, Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism."
"Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ""Coucher de soleil"" and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:"
"The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ""Paysage au disque"" (1906-1907), writes Herbert, ""is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..."""
"""The Neo-Impressionists"" according to Maurice Denis, ""inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."""
"In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The Poincaré homology sphere, also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the 3-sphere itself, with a finite fundamental group. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented."
= = = Huntsville Fire = = =
"The Huntsville Fire was an American professional indoor soccer team based in Huntsville, Alabama. The Fire played in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League during both of the league's seasons from 1997 to 1998. They played their home games in the Von Braun Center. The team began the 1997 season as the Florida-based Daytona Beach Speedkings before financial struggles forced a sale early in the season."
"During their existence, the Fire/Speedkings played a combined total of 52 games, winning 29, two via shootout, and losing 23, two via shootout. They scored a total of 810 goals and allowed a total of 702 goals and notched 87 total standings points out of a possible 156 points. The EISL awarded 3 standings points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation."
"The team, a charter member of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League, was founded as the Daytona Beach Speedkings. They played their home games at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, under the direction of coach Scott Cooper. The team played the first-ever game in EISL history, losing to the Savannah Rug Ratz in front of a ""disappointing"" crowd of 600 fans. Despite having a winning record (5–3) and the league's top offense, the team failed to draw fans and suffered financially. Before the season, team owner Blake Cullen told the ""Orlando Sentinel"" that the team would need to average about 3,000 fans per game to break even. The team's official home attendance average was 609 per game but the bulk of those were complimentary tickets with the SpeedKings selling fewer than 200 tickets per game."
"This failure prompted Cullen to sell the team to Major League Indoor Football, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, who announced the team would relocate to the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In just three weeks the new management headed by team president Bryan Dresden, moved the team from Daytona Beach opening to an inaugural crowd of over 2500 new fans in Huntsville, Alabama. The renamed Huntsville Fire finished the season with a record of 13 wins and 11 losses, including 1 shootout win. This gave the team a total of 38 points for the 1997 season and 4th place in the seven-team league."
"The Fire returned for the 1998 season. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins and 12 losses (including 1 shootout win and two shootout losses) for 49 points. This placed them 3rd overall in the seven-team league. The Fire made the playoffs, losing to the Mississippi Beach Kings 2 games to 1 in the semi-final round. The Fire averaged 2,535 fans per game, fourth-best in the EISL where the average league game saw 2,733 fans in attendance."
"As Pope developed the game, he regularly posted updates to TIGSource, a forum for independent developers, and got helpful feedback on some of the game's direction. He also created a publicly available demonstration of the game, which further had positive feedback to him. Pope opted to try to have the game submitted to the Steam storefront through the user-voted Greenlight process in April 2013; he was hesitant that the niche nature of the game would put off potential voters and had expected that he would gain more interest from upcoming gaming expositions. However, due to attention drawn by several YouTube streamers that played through the demo, ""Papers, Please"" was voted through Greenlight within days."
"With new attention to the project, Pope estimated that the game would now take six months to complete, though it ultimately took nine months. One area he expanded on was to create several unique character names for the various citizens that would pass through the game. He opened up to the public to supply names, but ended up with over 30,000 entries, with more than half he considered unusable as they did not figure the types of Eastern European names he wanted or were otherwise ""joke names"". After the Greenlight process, Pope started to add other features that required the player, as a lowly checkpoint worker, to make significant moral decisions within the game. One such design was the inclusion of the body scanner, where Pope envisioned that the player would recognize this being an invasion of privacy but necessary to detect a suicide bomber. These also helped to drive the game's narrative as to provide rationale for why the player as the passport checker would need to have access to these new tools in response to the larger events in the game's fiction. After being successfully voted on Greenlight, ""Papers, Please"" was being touted as an ""empathy game"", similar to ""Cart Life"" (2011), helping Pope to justify his narrative choices. Pope also recognized that not all players would necessarily appreciate the narrative aspects, and started to develop the ""endless"" mode where players would simply need to process a queue of immigrants limited only by the player making a certain number of mistakes."
"Pope released the game on August 8, 2013 for Windows and OS X systems, and for Linux machines on February 12, 2014."
"Pope had ported the game to the iPad, and was considering a port to the PlayStation Vita though noted that with the handheld, there are several challenges related to the game's user interface that may have to be revamped. The Vita version was formally announced at the 2014 Gamescom convention in August 2014. With the iOS release, Apple required Pope to censor the full body scanner feature from the game, considering the aspect to be pornographic content. However Apple later commented that the rejection was due to a ""misunderstanding"" and allowed Pope to resubmit the uncensored game by including a ""nudity option"". The iPad version was subsequently released on December 12, 2014. The Vita's version was released on December 12, 2017."
"By March 2014, Pope stated that he was ""kind of sick to death"" of ""Papers, Please"", in that he wanted to continue to focus on more smaller games that would only take a few months of time to create and release, and had already spent far too much in his mind on this one. He expected to keep supporting ""Papers, Please"" and its ports, but had no plans to expand the game or release downloadable content, but does not rule out revisiting the Arstotzka setting again in a future game."
"""Papers, Please"" received positive reviews on release, receiving ""generally favorable reviews"" from 40 reviews on Metacritic. ""Papers, Please"" has been praised for the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction. CBC News' Jonathan Ore called ""Papers, Please"" a ""nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters – all from a desk job"". Simon Parkin writing for ""The New Yorker"" blog declared ""Papers, Please"" the top video game of 2013. He wrote: ""Grim yet affecting, it’s a game that may change your attitude the next time you’re in line at the airport."" Some critics received the story very well: Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of The Escapist's series ""Zero Punctuation"" lauded the game for being a truly unique entry for 2013 and even made it one of his top five games for that year; he cited the game's morality as his reasoning by explaining that ""[""Papers, Please""] presents us constant moral choices, but makes it really hard to be a good person... while you could waive the rules to reunite a couple [...] you do it at the expense of your own family... You have to decide if you want to create a better world or just look after you and yours."""
"""Wired"" listed ""Papers, Please"" as their top game for 2013, recognizing that the game's title, often coupled with the Hollywood representation of Nazi officials stopping people and demanding to see their identification, alongside the drab presentation captured the ideas of living as a lowly worker in a police state. In 2019, the game was ranked 45th on ""The Guardian"" newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list."
"Some critics reacted against the paperwork gameplay. Stephanie Bendixsen from the ABC's game review show ""Good Game"" found the game ""tedious"", commenting ""while I found the issues that arose from the decisions you are forced to make quite interesting, I was just so bored that I just struggled to go from one day to the next. I was torn between wanting to find out more, and just wanting it all to stop."""
"""Papers, Please"" is considered by several journalists as an example of video games as an art form. ""Papers, Please"" is frequently categorized as an ""empathy game"", a type of role-playing game that ""asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds"", as described by Patrick Begley of the ""Sydney Morning Herald"", or as described by Pope himself, ""other people simulators"". Pope noted that he had not set out to make an empathy game, but the emotional ties created by his scenarios came about naturally from developing the core mechanics."

The game won ""Best Simulation Game"" and was nominated in the categories of ""Best Game"", ""Game Design"", and ""Game Innovation"" at the 2014 BAFTA Video Games Awards."
"As of March 2014, at the time of the BAFTA awards, Pope stated that the game had sold 500,000 copies. By August 2016, three years from release, Pope stated that more than 1.8 million copies had been sold across all platforms."
"Two Russian filmmakers, Liliya Tkach and Nikita Ordynskiy of Kinodom Productions, developed an 11-minute live-action film based on ""Papers, Please"", entitled ""Papers, Please: The Short Film"", starring Igor Savochkin as the passport inspector.

The film debuted worldwide via YouTube and the Steam storefront on February 24, 2018. The film received ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews on Steam upon its release. The short film's success led Tkach and Ordynskiy to pursue a similar short film for ""Beholder"", another game set in a totalitarian state.

"Kingston is a former town that is no longer in existence. Originally in Fresno County, until 1909 when Fresno County lands in the vicinity, south of Kings river were transferred to Kings County, California. It was located on the south bank of the Kings River northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry."
"L. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called ""El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles"" (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river. Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858. A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis. Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston."
"Oliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859. Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872. In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year."
"On December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away. Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned. Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930."
"The site of the town is now a California Historical Landmark (#270), which can be found in Kingston-Laton County Park in Kings County."
= = = Voluntary euthanasia = = =
Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary euthanasia (VE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.
"Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada."
"Voluntary refusal of food and fluids (VRFF) (also called voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, or VSED) or Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia, while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option. VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia."
"Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with ""active euthanasia"" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important. For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited."
"The term euthanasia comes from the Greek words ""eu""-meaning good and ""thanatos""-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or ""dying well"". Hippocrates mentions euthanasia in the Hippocratic Oath, which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.” Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, where a person no longer cared for his life."
"English Common Law from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, Thomas More, considered a saint by Roman Catholics, described a utopian community and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of ""torturing and lingering pain"", see The meaning of the work."
"Since the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years. After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors. Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s."
"In an article in the ""Bulletin of the History of Medicine"", Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. Appel indicates social activist Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, was the driving force behind this movement. According to historian Ian Dowbiggin, leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, advocated for the legalization of euthanasia."
"In 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain. During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as ""mercy killings,"" such as by parents of their severely disabled children."
"During the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included Glanville Williams (""The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law"") and clergyman Joseph Fletcher (""Morals and medicine""). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased."
"In 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996, was passed in the Northern Territory of Australia. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a device designed by Dr Philip Nitschke. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997. In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded EXIT International. In 2009, an Australian quadriplegic was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die. The Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes. Chief Justice Wayne Martin also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions. Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection."
"On 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that ""the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient"" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia ""in the shortest time possible""."
"On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death."
"In 1957 in Britain, Judge Devlin ruled in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide, and in 2002, restrictions were loosened. During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in Belgium. Belgium's at the time most famous author Hugo Claus, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an Antwerp doctor."
"A key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit."
"In 1980 the Hemlock Society USA was founded in Santa Monica by Derek Humphry. It was the first group in the United States to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death. Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law. In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices."
"In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992. Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television. Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia."
"In 1994, Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act, permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997. The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case ""Gonzales v. Oregon""."
"In 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, Terri Schiavo, a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no living will and the rest of her family claimed otherwise."
"In November 2008, Washington Initiative 1000 made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide."
"The South Jersey Port Corporation operates three terminals at the Port of Camden and is expanding operations to the Port of Paulsboro. The agency owns and operates the Salem Terminal, which had been publicly operated as the Salem Municipal Wharf and privately operated by Salem Terminals Ltd. and Del Stevedoring. It includes berth-side truck access to of berthing space with of beam (breadth). There is of covered shed and warehouse storage space. The terminal handles barges and container ships for construction aggregate, clothing, fishing apparel, motor vehicles, agricultural produce, seafood, and consumer goods."
"Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring relocated from Maine to Salem in the 1980s to be closer to the source of products they export and utilize the newly established port facilities. In 1990, they opened the Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring Wharf, a small wharf terminal that is also utilized by several other shipping companies and located approximately above the entrance of the Salem River at 128 Tilbury Road on the east side of Barber's Basin marina, to handle bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. It has of berthing space with water depth. It includes of open storage space and utility connections for refrigerated containers. While the wharf is currently owned by Bermuda International Terminals, it is operated by Mid-Atlantic."
"Mid-Atlantic also operates the Tilbury Road Associates owned wharf with of berthing space, utility connections for refrigerated containers, and of open storage space on the west side of Barber's Basin."
"The Port Inland Distribution Network involves new or expanded transportation systems for redistribution by barge and rail for the shipped goods and containers that are delivered at area ports in an effort to curtail the use of trucks and their burden on the environment, traffic, and highway systems. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), and Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), are involved in initiatives to review and develop this network."
"While it was determined that Salem was not an ideal location within the program for handling container shipping for intermodal freight transport, a private sector service provider began in 2010 the short sea shipping of aggregate products with a barge service between Salem and Tremley Point, Linden on the Arthur Kill in the Port of New York and New Jersey. It addresses a critical missing link in multimodal freight transport between ports in the Delaware Valley and the Northern New Jersey's urban Gateway Region."
America's Marine Highway is a similar US Department of Transportation initiative to capitalize on US waterways for the transport of goods for which NJDOT applied and received approval for review and potential development of their initiative into a federally supported project. Salem would be considered for increased transportation by shipping vessels to customers along the East Coast.
"Barber's Basin is a marina between the two wharfs operated by Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring. It is home to the United States Coast Guard Small Salem Station, a seasonal unit in operation from late May to mid-October. In 2013, the Coast Guard reduced staffing from daily to weekend operations. The private docks of the Salem Boating Club, across the river in Pennsville, also serve pleasure craft."
"Delaware River and Bay Authority's Three Forts Ferry Crossing was renamed the Delaware City–Salem Ferry in 2013 to reflect changes in service due to Hurricane Sandy damages. The seasonal service, rather than traveling to Fort Mott, departs from Barber's Basin with service across the river to Delaware City, which has the nearby Fort DuPont State Park, with connecting service to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island effective May 4, 2013 for the summer seasonal service. The ferry returned to serving Fort Mott on its previous route (instead of Salem) in 2015 and is now called the Forts Ferry Crossing."
"Salem has been an occasional port of call for promotional and educational functions for the A. J. Meerwald, the New Jersey State Tall Ship."

"The Droid Maxx is a high end smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility. It is the first Droid to be a high end smartphone exclusively developed by Motorola for Verizon Wireless. It is part of the Verizon Droid line, and was announced on 23 July 2013 along with the Droid Ultra and Droid Mini at a joint Motorola and Verizon Wireless press conference."
"The Droid Maxx maintains a similar design shape to its predecessor, the Droid Razr HD, including the Dupont Kevlar unibody form. It included Motorola's proprietary X8 Mobile Computing System, which consists of 8 cores: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, 1 low-power core for natural language processing, and 1 low-power core for contextual awareness processing to enable the new Touchless control feature. The internal battery was increased in size to 3,500 mAh. The on-screen buttons for back, home, and multitask functions were moved to off-screen capacitive soft-keys below the screen. The Droid Maxx also includes Motorola's Active Notification feature."
"Reception towards the device was mostly positive, with the caveat that the device is only available on the US carrier, Verizon Wireless. Some reviewing outlets called the device ""the best Android device available on Verizon Wireless"". Many others praised Motorola's Active Notification system, which turns on part of the AMOLED screen to ""blink"" notifications to the user, in lieu of a traditional LED notification light. The soft touch kevlar unibody as well as the overall physical design was praised as well. Reviewers were mixed to the device's continued use of a 720p HD resolution at a 5 in (130 mm) screen size, though complimented the AMOLED display's brightness, deep blacks, and its benefits to battery conservation."
"The Droid Maxx runs a mostly stock version of Google's Android mobile operating system, initially shipping with the version 4.2.2 ""Jellybean"". Jellybean 4.2 included various improvements to accessibility, new lock screen features with quick access to the camera, support for wireless display (Miracast), and a new built-in clock application with world clock, stopwatch, and timer. Motorola and Verizon released an update to Android 4.4 ""KitKat"" on 19 December 2013, and an additional update to Android 4.4.4 on 15 July 2014. KitKat brought restyled navigation bars, ""immersive"" full-screen mode, strongNer security, power management and some other minor improvements. Motorola also enhanced its proprietary camera software for better color, exposure, and dynamic range accuracy and included the updated Google Hangouts application which included SMS/MMS messaging functionality. Finally, support for the Square credit card reader was added. The KitKat 4.4.4 update brought further improvements to camera functionality, improved Bluetooth connectivity, and added Isis Mobile Wallet (now called Softcard)."
"The smartphone can share its internet connection over WiFi (hotspot), and can access the Google Play Store, an online distribution platform for the Android OS managed by Google. Users may purchase and download applications developed using the Android SDK, music, movies, television shows, books, and magazine subscriptions."
"The Droid Maxx, like its Moto X sibling, showcases the Google Now function via Touchless Control. By speaking the hot phrase: ""Ok Google Now"" (even while the phone is asleep), the device will launch a voice assistant which taps into Google Now to control the phone and run natural language queries with the Google search engine without requiring physical input from the user. This function makes use of the natural language processor in the X8 system."
"Active Notifications displays relevant notifications to the user while the phone is face-up. The minimalist notifications show on the lock screen as white icons against a black background; power is conserved by not turning on pixels that would display the black background. Furthermore, by use of the Contextual Awareness processor in the X8 system and proximity sensor, the Droid Maxx ""knows"" when it is face-down or in a pocket, and will not display Active Notifications."
"The Droid Maxx user interface consists of three soft keys: back, home, and multitask, lock/power button, and volume rocker keys."
"The construction is a unibody design (no removable panels) and consists of a thin black bezel devoid of any branding surrounding the screen and a DuPont Kevlar sealed back plate in either matte clear or glossy red tint finish. The shape maintains the tapered corner look of the Droid [RAZR] design language. Size has been increased to house a 5 in (130 mm) Super AMOLED touchscreen, with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels at 294 ppi and made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The device is 8.5 mm (0.33 in) thick and weighs 167 grams (5.9 oz)."
"Droid Maxx is powered by the proprietary Motorola X8 system-on-chip. It includes a total of 8 cores with various functions: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor clocked at 1.7 GHz, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, and 2 low-power cores: for natural language processing and for contextual awareness processing. The X8 system is designed to conserve power by utilizing low-power cores for the language and contextual processing."
"The device's battery is 3500 mAh, which provides a claimed 48 hours of ""typical"" usage. The phone comes with either 16 or 32 gigabytes of on board storage as well as NFC capability and Qi wireless charging."
= = = Pogo mine = = =
The Pogo mine is a gold mine in the state of Alaska. By 31 December 2017 Pogo had produced 3.6 million ounces of gold at a grade of 13.6 g/t. The mine has estimated indicated and inferred mineral resources of 4.15 million ounces of gold at a grade of 14.7 g/t (JORC). It is located northeast of Delta Junction and east of Fairbanks.
"The orebody consists of numerous highly irregular quartz veins, ranging in thickness from with being typical, and ranging in dip from horizontal to vertical with 30-45 degrees being normal. A complex system of faulting offsets the veins both parallel and perpendicular to the strike, resulting in a ""chopped-up"" orebody. Until 2019 the mine utilized drift-and-fill and overhand cut-and-fill mining methods when, under new owner Northern Star Resources, the mining method was changed to longhole stoping. Access to the orebody is via decline and spiral ramp. After blasting, ore is trucked to the central underground ""ore bin"", where it is then fed to a conveyor that takes it out of the mine directly to the mill. Typical daily production is about 2,500 tons of ore yielding approximately 1,000 troy ounces of gold."
"Pogo is notable for its paste backfill system, where 20% of the mine's tailings from which gold has been extracted are mixed with cement and then pumped back underground to support subsequent further excavation. This has the additional environmental benefit of reducing the amount of tailings that need to be stored on surface, minimizing the footprint of the mine's dry-stack tailings storage facility."

"The people of Sefwi Wiawso trace a call for a ""return"" to normative Judaism by Aaron Ahomtre Toakyirafa, a community leader who, in 1976, is said to have had a vision. In 2012, Gabrielle Zilkha, a Toronto-based filmmaker, visited Sefwe Wiawso to do research for a documentary about the House of Israel she is making. According to Zilkha, about 200 people--mostly children--live in the community. She states that the lack of a historical record makes it difficult to verify the groups claims, but that there is an oral tradition dating back 200 years."
"The leader of the House of Israel since 1993, David Ahenkorah received his own vision in taking up the mantle. He has been granted a 40-acre plot of land to build a Jewish school for the community, but they have not yet been able to raise funds for construction. Children currently attend a local school, run by Christians. They built a synagogue in 1998 in New Adiembra, a Jewish neighborhood in Sefri Wiawso. Recently, they painted it blue and white, the colors of Israel. There are several family compounds nearby and about 200 people belong to the synagogue."

= = = Itsekiri people = = =
"The Itsekiri (also called the Isekiri, ""iJekri"", ""Itsekri"", ""Ishekiri"", or Itsekhiri) are an ethnic group of Nigeria's Niger Delta area, Delta State. The Itsekiri presently number just under 1 million people and live mainly in the Warri South, Warri North and Warri South West local government districts of Delta State on the Atlantic coast of Nigeria. Significant communities of Itsekiris can be found in parts of Edo and Ondo states and in various other Nigerian cities including Lagos, Sapele, Benin City, Port Harcourt and Abuja. Many people of Itsekiri descent also reside in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.The Itsekiris are closely related to the Yoruba of South Western Nigeria and more widely to the Urhobo (especially the Okpe) and Edo peoples."
The Itsekiris traditionally refer to their land as the Kingdom of Warri or 'Iwerre' as its proper name – which is geographically contiguous to the area covered by the three Warri local government districts. The area is a key centre of Nigeria's crude oil and natural gas production and petroleum refining and the main town Warri (a multi-ethnic metropolis) forms the industrial and commercial nucleus of the Delta State region.
"The Itsekiri are a people of very mixed ethnic origins who speak a language very closely related to the Yoruba of south western Nigeria and the Igala language of central Nigeria but which has also borrowed some cultural practice from the Edo people of Benin City, given the hegemony that the Benin Empire once exercised over the area, Portuguese in trade terminologies, as the Itsekiri were the first people in Nigeria to establish contact with the Portuguese who were exploring the West African coast, and also more recently, English. Although linguistically related to the Yoruba and Igala ethnic groups, however, through centuries of intermingling modern day Itsekiris are of mixed ethnic origins. They are most closely related to the South-Eastern Yorubaland sub-groups - Ijebu, Akure, Ikale, Ondo and Owo), but also Edo, Urhobo, Ijaw are today mainly Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic) by religion."
"Thus having had six centuries of direct cultural exposure to Western Christianity and other African influences, contemporary Itsekiri language and culture has successfully evolved into a hybrid of the many cultures that have influenced its development. Similarly owing to the complex genetic mix of most Itsekiris over the centuries, many individuals self-identifying as Itsekiri would usually be a complex mix of any of the aforementioned ethnic and racial groups. Thus modern day Itsekiris may be the only southern Nigerian ethnic group to be almost totally heterogeneous (mixed) in its genetic composition. The total absence of any dialectal variation in the Itsekiri language is also unique for the region and is most likely the result of the early coalescing of the Itsekiri people into a small and highly centralised nation state from the 15th century onward."
"In the 15th century, the early Itsekiris adopted a prince Ginuwa (also called ""Iginuwa"" in Bini Language) from the Kingdom of Benin as a monarch, and quickly coalesced into a kingdom under his rule. Traditionally fishermen and traders, the Itsekiri were among the first in the region to make contact with Portuguese traders. These interactions in the 16th century led the Itsekiri to become primarily Roman Catholic."
"The Itsekiri monarchy has continued to the present day, with the coronation of Ogiame Ikenwoli on 12 December in 2015. The Itsekiri's historical capital is Ode-Itsekiri (also called ""big warri"" or ""Ale iwerre""), though the monarch's main palace is in Warri town the largest city in the area and home to diverse other communities including the Urhobos, Ijaws, Isoko, and many other Nigerian and expatriate groups working in the oil and gas industry."
"The Itsekiri, though a minority group within Nigeria, are considered to be a highly educated and affluent ethnic group with a very high rate of literacy and a rich cultural heritage. The Itsekiris have one of the oldest histories of western education in West Africa, and are noted for producing one of its earliest university graduates – the Olu of Warri Kingdom, Olu Atuwatse I, Dom Domingo a 17th-century graduate of Coimbra University in Portugal. Today, many Itsekiris can be found working in the professions particularly medicine, law and the academic professions and in business, trade and industry and were among the pioneers that led the development of the professions in Nigeria during the early-to-mid 20th century ."
The Itsekiris traditionally lived in a society that was governed by a monarchy (the Olu) and council of chiefs who form the nobility or aristocracy. Itsekiri society itself was organised along the lines of an upper class made up of the royal family and the aristocracy – the 'Oloyes and Olareajas' these were mainly drawn from noble houses including the Royal Houses and the Houses of Olgbotsere (Prime Minister or king maker) and Iyatsere (defence minister). The middle class or Omajaja were free-born Itsekiris or burghers. As a result of the institution of slavery and the slave trade there was a third class 'Oton-Eru' or those descended from the slave class whose ancestors had come from elsewhere and settled in Itsekiriland as indentured or slave labourers. In modern-day Itsekiri society the slave class no longer exists as all are considered free-born.
"Traditionally, Itsekiri men wear a long sleeved shirt called a Kemeje, tie a George wrapper around their waist and wear a hat with a feather stuck to it. The women wear a blouse and also tie a George wrapper around their waist. They wear colourful head gears known as Nes (scarf) or coral beads. Itsekiris are also famed for their traditional fishing skills, melodious songs, gracefully fluid traditional dances and colourful masquerades and boat regattas."
"Before the introduction of Christianity in the 16th century, like many other African groups, the Itsekiris largely followed a traditional form of religion known as Ebura-tsitse (based on ancestral worship) which has become embedded in modern-day traditional Itsekiri culture. Once the dominant form of western Christianity in Itsekiriland for centuries, only a minority of Itsekiris are Roman Catholics today whilst the majority are Protestants notably Baptist and Anglican."
"Whilst genetically, the Itsekiris are a complex mixture of the many different ethnicities and races that have settled in their area, however, the Itsekiri language is very closely related to the Ilaje and other south-eastern Yoruba dialects and to the Igala. It has also been influenced significantly by the Bini, Portuguese and English languages due to centuries of interaction with people from those nations. However, it remains a key branch of the Yoruboid family of languages even retaining archaic or lost elements of the proto Yoruba language due to its relative isolation in the Niger-Delta where it developed away from the main cluster of Yoruba language dialects."
"Unlike nearly all key Nigerian Languages, the Itsekiri language does not have dialects and is uniformly spoken with little or no variance in pronunciation apart from the use of 'ch' for the regular 'ts' (sh) in the pronunciation of some individual Itsekiris, e.g. Chekiri instead of the standard Shekiri but these are individual pronunciation traits rather than dialectal differences. This may be a relic of past dialectal differences. The English language continues to exert a strong influence on the Itsekiri language both in influencing its development and in its widespread usage as a first language amongst the younger generation. Modern standard Yoruba (the variety spoken in Lagos) also appears to be influencing the Itsekiri language partly due to the similarity between both languages and the ease of absorbing colloquial Yoruba terms by the large Itsekiri population living in Western Nigerian cities. Itsekiri is now taught in local schools up to university degree level in Nigeria."
"There are a number of semi-autonomous Itsekiri communities such as Ugborodo, koko, Omadino and Obodo whose history predates the 15th-century establishment of the Warri Kingdom. The Ugborodo community claims direct descent from the Ijebu a major Yoruba sub-ethnic group"
= = = Assyrians in Iran = = =
"Assyrians in Iran, Iranian Assyrians or Persian Assyrians (), (), are an ethnic and linguistic minority in present-day Iran. The Assyrians of Iran speak Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a neo-Aramaic language descended from Classical Syriac and elements of Akkadian, and are Eastern Rite Christians belonging mostly to the Assyrian Church of the East and also to the Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Chaldean Catholic Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church."
"They share a common history and ethnic identity, rooted in shared linguistic, cultural and religious traditions, with Assyrians in Iraq, Assyrians in Turkey and Assyrians in Syria, as well as with the Assyrian diaspora."
"The Assyrian community in Iran numbered approximately 200,000 prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. However, after the revolution many Assyrians left the country, primarily for the United States; the 1996 Iranian census counted only 32,000 Assyrians. Current estimates of the Assyrian population in Iran range from 32,000 () to 50,000 ()."
"The Iranian capital, Tehran, is home to the majority of Iranian Assyrians; however, approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in Urmia and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area."
"The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ratified in 1979, recognizes Assyrians as a religious minority and ethnic minority and reserves for them one seat in the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian parliament. , the seat was occupied by Yonathan Betkolia, who was elected in 2000 and reelected in the 2004 legislative election."
"Today, scholars estimate that there are only around 5,000 Assyrians left in the historical center of the city of Urmia."
"The Assyrian presence in Iran goes back 4,000 years to ancient times, and Assyria was involved in the history of Ancient Iran even before the arrival of the modern Iranian peoples to the region circa 1000 BC. During the Old Assyrian Empire (c.2025-1750 BC) and Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC) the Assyrians ruled over parts of ""Pre-Iranic"" northern and western Iran. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC) saw Assyria conquer the Iranic Persians, Medes and Parthians into their empire, together with the ancient ""pre-Iranic"" Elamites, Kassites, Manneans and Gutians, and also the Iranic Cimmerians of Asia Minor and Scythians of the Caucasus. The home of the Assyrians in Iran has traditionally been along the western shore of Lake Urmia from the Salmas area to the Urmia plain."
"After the fall of Assyria between 612 and 599 BC, after decades of civil war, followed by an attack by an alliance of former subject peoples; the Medes, Persians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Scythians and Cimmerians, its people became an integral part of the Achaemenid Empire (as did Assyria itself), holding important military, civic and economic positions, and the Achaemenid Persians, having spent centuries under Assyrian domination, were greatly influenced by Assyrian Art and Architecture, modelled their empire upon Assyrian lines, and saw themselves as the successors of the great Assyrian kings. Assyrians are still attested as being extant in the north west of the region during the Parthian Empire (160 BC-223 AD) and Sassanid Empire (224-650 AD), and throughout the Middle Ages, where the Bukhtishu family of physicians were held in great regard by the Persian kings."
"There were about 200,000 Assyrians in Iran at the time of the 1976 census. Many emigrated after the revolution in 1979, but at least 50,000 were estimated to be still in Iran in 1987."
"In 1900, Assyrians numbered over 76,000 in northwestern Iran, constituting over a quarter of the Azerbaijan province's population and were the largest non-Muslim majority in Urmia. Of the 300 villages around Urmia, 60 were exclusively Assyrians and 60 were mixed villages with Assyrian, Armenian, and Azeri communities. Nevertheless, there were over 115 documented Assyrian villages to the west of Lake Urmia prior to 1918."
"During the Assyrian Genocide, which took place in World War I, the Ottoman Army together with allied Kurdish, Azeri and Arab militias along the Iranian-Turkish and Iranian-Iraqi border carried out religiously and ethnically motivated massacres and deportations on unarmed Assyrian civilians (and Armenians) both in the mountains and on the rich plains, resulting in the death of at least 300,000 Assyrians. In 1914 alone, they attacked dozens of villages and drove off all the inhabitants of the district of Gawar. The Assyrians defended themselves and for a time successfully repelled further attacks under the leadership of Agha Petros, seizing control of much of the Urmia region and defeating Ottoman forces and their Kurdish, Arab and Azeri allies in the process. However lack of ammunition and supplies, due mainly to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, and the collapse of allied Armenian forces led to their downfall. Massively outnumbered, surrounded, undersupplied and cut off, the Assyrians suffered terrible massacres."
"By the summer of 1918 almost all surviving Assyrians had fled to Tehran or to existing Assyrian communities or refugee camps in Iraq such as Baqubah. Local Kurds, Arabs and Azeris took the opportunity of the last phases of World War I to rob Assyrian homes, murder civilians and leave those remaining destitute. The critical murder that sowed panic in the Assyrian community came when Kurdish militias, under Agha Ismail Simko, assassinated the Patriarch, Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX, on March 3, 1918, under the pretext of inviting him to negotiations, although the Assyrian leader Malik Khoshaba exacted revenge upon Simko by attacking and sacking his citadel, forcing the Kurdish leader to flee for his life."
"Most Assyrians in Iran are followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, with a minority of 3,900 following the Chaldean Catholic Church. Some also follow Protestant denominations such as the Assyrian Evangelical Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and possibly Russian Orthodoxy due to a Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia during the 1900s."

= = = Doctor of Professional Studies = = =
"The Doctor of Professional Studies (or sometimes awarded as Doctorate in Professional Practice) (most commonly DProf, but also available as ProfD and DPS) is a doctoral degree for experienced professionals who wish to undertake a programme that is applied in nature and of practical value to their career. The DProf is based on applied research of real world problems. The DProf has been available to graduate students in the United Kingdom since the 1980s. The first Doctor of Professional Studies program was started in 1972 at Pace University. Although some consider the Doctor of Professional Studies to have similar academic standards and regulations as the PhD, it has a more practical focus."
"The first professional doctoral program was established in 1972 by Pace University in the State of New York in the United States. Other universities (see #List of Schools Offering Doctor of Professional Studies Degrees) around the world now offer the professional doctoral degree. Doctoral studies researchers, Gill and Hoppe, have reported rapid growth in professional doctoral degree programs outside of the United States."
"In the United Kingdom, professional doctoral degrees became established in the 1980s, when it was recognized that high-level programs were needed that were designed for experienced professional practitioners rather than for academic researchers. Many professional doctoral degrees in the United Kingdom are profession-specific and contain a mix of taught modules, research and a dissertation. Several universities that offer professional doctoral degree programs in the United Kingdom allow students to study part-time. In 2005, Powell and Long found that most professional doctoral degrees awarded in the UK were in the fields of engineering, educational and clinical psychology. They found that professional doctoral degrees in business and nursing were also emerging at that time. In 2010, Brown and Cooke reported an ""explosion"" of professional doctorate programs in fields such as the arts, architecture and computer science. In 2016, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) released a comprehensive study of professional doctorates which found substantial growth in these programs. Since 2012, the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) has sponsored a bi-annual conference devoted to the study of professional doctoral education and related programs."
"In the United States, the DPS was once considered by the United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to be a research doctorate equivalent to the Ph.D. Along with the Doctor of Education, the Doctor of Social Science, the Doctor of Applied Science, and the Doctor of Library Science, the NSF no longer includes the DPS in its periodic Survey of Earned Doctorates (SEP) report, a statistical report on the number and range of research doctorates awarded in the United States. [See: https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/ and https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2012/start.cfm, Appendix Table a1]. The DPS was dropped from the report in 2005. In New York State, the Doctor of Professional Studies is an official degree title applicable to doctoral programs with a professional focus in a variety of disciplines."
"In a 2002 report, the Australian Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST), states ""Doctoral education in Australia is currently under pressure to become more industry focused."" Citing this report, Fink suggests ""professional doctorates may be able to fulfill [the need to make doctoral education more industry focused] by developing and sustaining close collaboration between universities and industry. The Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc) can be seen as an alternative to the PhD because it can provide an opportunity for the business professional to gain a doctoral qualification, albeit in a different mode."""
"In some respects the DProf is closer to the PhD than the longer-established modular doctorates, although it has important differences. While PhD theses typically make an original contribution to knowledge, the DProf is more concerned with making a significant contribution to practice: it requires high-level practical action, resulting for instance in significant change or development in an organization or community of practice. At some institutions, the DProf project is not a purely academic study and may not have to be a research project in the conventional sense. But, the dissertation must make a substantial contribution to the field and be reflective of advanced thinking. In this regard, the effort require to complete a Doctor of Professional Studies degree is at least equivalent to that required for a PhD."
"Specific degree characteristics vary by country and institution. In 2011, the UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education published an overview of degree characteristics for all doctoral level degrees."

"In English, they self-identify as ""Syriac"", sometimes expanded to ""Syriac-Aramean"" or ""Aramean-Syriac"". In Swedish, they call themselves ""Syrianer"", and in German, """" is a common self-designation."
"The Aramean Democratic Organization, based in Lebanon, is an advocate of the Aramean identity and an independent state in their ancient homeland of Aram."
"Self-identification of some Syriac Christians with Arameans is well documented in Syriac literature. Mentions by notable individuals include that of the poet-theologian Jacob of Serugh, (c. 451 – 29 November 521) who describes Venerated Father St. Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306 – 373) as ""He who became a crown for the people of the Aramaeans [armāyūthā], (and) by him we have been brought close to spiritual beauty"". Ephrem himself made references to Aramean origins, calling his country Aram-Nahrin and his language Aramaic, and describing Bar-Daisan (d. 222) of Edessa as ""The Philosopher of the Arameans"", who ""made himself a laughing-stock among Arameans and Greeks.” Michael the Elder (d. 1199) writes of his race as that of ""the Aramaeans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians.” Bar Hebraeus (d. 1286) writes in his Book of Rays of the ""Aramean-Syrian nation""."
"However, references such as these to an Aramean identity are scarce after the early Middle Ages, until the development of Aramean nationalism in the late 20th century."
"In 2014, Israel has decided to recognize the Aramean community within its borders as a national minority, allowing most of the Syriac Christians in Israel (around 10,000) to be registered as ""Aramean"" instead of ""Arab"". This decision on part of the Israeli Interior Ministry highlights the growing awareness regarding the distinctness of the Aramean identity as well as their plight due to the historical Arabization of the region."
"Most of the Maronites identify with a Phoenician origin, as do much of the Lebanese population, and do not see themselves as Assyrian, Syriac or Aramean. This comes from the fact that present day Lebanon, the Mediterranean coast of Syria, and northern Israel is the area that roughly corresponds to ancient Phoenicia and as a result like the majority of the Lebanese people identify with the ancient Phoenician population of that region. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous Phoenician elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. In a 2013 interview the lead investigator, Pierre Zalloua, pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions:""Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another."""
"However, a small minority of Lebanese Maronites like the Lebanese author Walid Phares tend to see themselves to be ethnic Assyrians and not ethnic Phoenicians. Walid Phares, speaking at the 70th Assyrian Convention, on the topic of Assyrians in post-Saddam Iraq, began his talk by asking why he as a Lebanese Maronite ought to be speaking on the political future of Assyrians in Iraq, answering his own question with ""because we are one people. We believe we are the Western Assyrians and you are the Eastern Assyrians."""
Another small minority of Lebanese Maronites like the Maronites in Israel tend to see themselves to be ethnic Arameans and not ethnic Phoenicians.
"However, other Maronite factions in Lebanon, such as Guardians of the Cedars, in their opposition to Arab nationalism, advocate the idea of a pure Phoenician racial heritage (see Phoenicianism). They point out that all Lebanese people are of pre-Arab and pre-Islamic origin, and as such are at least, in part, of the Phoenician-Canaanite stock."
"The Saint Thomas Christians of India, where they are known as Syrian Christians, though ethnically unrelated to the peoples known as Assyrian, Aramean or Syrian/Syriac, had strong cultural and religious links with Mesopotamia as a result of trade links and missionary activity by the Church of the East at the height of its influence. Following the 1653 Coonan Cross Oath, many Saint Thomas Christians passed to the Syriac Orthodox Church and later split into several distinct churches. The majority, remaining faithful to the East Syriac Rite, form the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, from which a small group, known as the Chaldean Syrian Church, seceded and in the early 20th century linked with what is now called the Assyrian Church of the East."
"""Syrian"" is a national identity for a citizen of the Syrian Arab Republic, whether Christian or not."
"In India, ""Syrian Christians"", also known as Saint Thomas Christians, ""are a distinct, endomagous ethnic group, in many ways similar to a caste. They have a history of close to two thousand years, and in language, religion, and ethnicity, they are related to Persian as well as West Syrian Christian traditions""."
"Outside of India, Syrian Christians are all those Christians whose liturgies are in the Syriac language, even if they have been Arabized or live in other continents. A distinction is made between East and West Syrians in accordance with their use of the East Syriac Rite or the West Syriac Rite."
"Although inclusive of both Western and Eastern Syrian Christians, the term ""Syrian Christians"" is sometimes used in contexts where it refers more specifically to the Church of the East."
"Members of the Church of the East have been called Nestorians, since their church does not use ""Mother of God"" as a description of Mary, mother of Jesus, choosing instead to call her ""Mother of Christ"", and has therefore been accused of the Christological doctrine known as Nestorianism, which emphasizes the distinction between Christ's humanity and divinity to such an extent that its critics say it makes of him two distinct individuals. The justice of imputing this heresy to Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, whom the Assyrian Church of the East venerates as a saint, is disputed. David Wilmshurst states that for centuries ""the word 'Nestorian' was used both as a term of abuse by those who disapproved of the traditional East Syrian theology, as a term of pride by many of its defenders [...] and as a neutral and convenient descriptive term by others. Nowadays it is generally felt that the term carries a stigma"". Sebastian P. Brock says: ""The association between the Church of the East and Nestorius is of a very tenuous nature, and to continue to call that Church 'Nestorian' is, from a historical point of view, totally misleading and incorrect – quite apart from being highly offensive and a breach of ecumenical good manners."""
"Apart from its religious meaning, the word ""Nestorian"" has also been used in an ethnic sense, as shown by the phrase ""Catholic Nestorians""."
"Members of the Syriac Orthodox Church are sometimes called Jacobites, after Jacob Baradaeus, an appellation that leaders of that church have both deplored and accepted. They are sometimes also called Monophysites, a term they have always disputed, preferring to be referred to as Miaphysites."
"In Western media, Syriac Christians are often spoken of simply as Christians of their country or geographical region of residence: ""Iraqi Christians"", ""Iranian Christians"", ""Syrian Christians"", and ""Turkish Christians"". The ""Assyrian International News Agency"" interpreted this as ""Arabist policy of denying Assyrian identity and claiming that Assyrians, including Chaldeans and Syriacs, are Arab Christian minorities"". John Joseph states that, in Anglican writing, ""'Assyrian Christians', which originally had only meant 'The Christians of geographical Assyria', soon became 'Christian Assyrians'"", and cites J. F. Coakley, who remarked that, in the same context, ""the link created between the modern 'Assyrians' and the ancient Assyrians of Nineveh known to readers of the Old Testament [...] has proved irresistible to the imagination""."
"They are also spoken of as Arab Christians. This too the ""Assyrian International News Agency"" interpreted as ""Arabist policy"" and mentioned in particular the dedication by the ""American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee"" of a webpage to the Maronite Kahlil Gibran, who is ""viewed in Arabic literature as an innovator, not dissimilar to someone like W. B. Yeats in the West"". The vast majority of the Christians living in Israel self-identify as Arabs, but the Aramean community have wished to be recognized as a separate minority, neither Arab nor Palestinian but Aramean, while many others wish to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than Arabs. The wish of the Aramean community in Israel was granted in September 2014, opening for some 200 families the possibility, if they can speak Aramaic, to register as Arameans. Other Christians in Israel criticized this move, seeing it as intended to divide the Christians and also to limit to Muslims the definition of ""Arab""."

The circumstances surrounding his killing are disputed. The AFP news agency published eleven photographs taken by an amateur photographer through his window which depict the apprehension and shooting.
"Israeli police claim that Saleh had a large explosive device strapped to his waist, and that after being apprehended ""attempted several times to detonate the bomb by rubbing his chest against the ground in the hope of activating the detonation switch.""

"The Bishop of Kilmore is an episcopal title which takes its name after the parish of Kilmore, County Cavan in Ireland. In the Roman Catholic Church it remains a separate title, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other bishoprics."
"The see of Kilmore was originally known as Breifne (Latin: ""Tirbrunensis"", ""Tybruinensis"" or ""Triburnia""; Irish: ""Tír mBriúin"", meaning ""the land of the descendants of Brian"", one of the kings of Connaught) and took its name after the Kingdom of Breifne."
"If the main verb is a perfect tense, it is usually followed by the historic sequence, but if the meaning is equivalent to an English present perfect (i.e. ""have done""), it may be followed by primary sequence:"
"There are frequent exceptions to the sequence of tenses rule (see Latin tenses#Sequence of tenses rule). For example, verbs in conditional clauses do not usually follow the rule:"
Consecutive clauses also do not always follow the rule:
"Unlike English, when the sentence is an indirect statement (which uses the accusative and infinitive construction in Latin), the sequence of tenses rule does not apply in Latin, and the tense of the infinitive remains unchanged, no matter what the tense of the main verb. The present infinitive is used for a situation contemporaneous with the main verb:"
The perfect infinitive is used for an event or situation earlier than the time of the main verb:
"In Classical Greek, the tenses in subordinate clauses must correspond to those in the superordinate clauses governing them. (However, unlike Latin and Romance languages, the subjunctive mood has no tenses and won't follow the tenses, of course.)"
"A principal tense (present tense, future tense, or perfect tense) in the superordinate clause is followed by a principal tense in the indicative mood or subjunctive mood. Such a principal tense is followed by:"
"A historical tense (imperfect, pluperfect, or aorist) in the superordinate clause is followed by a historical tense in the indicative mood or optative mood. Such a historic tense is followed by:"
"In fact, since Greek tenses express the aspect of the verb, not the time, we don't have the ""Consecutio Temporum"", but the ""Consecutio Modorum"", the sequence of the Moods."
"The set of rules comprising the sequence of tenses (and modes of the main and subordinate clauses) in the Italian language corresponds in general to the ""consecutio temporum"" of the Latin grammar."
To determine the form of the verb in the subordinate clause it is necessary to know:
The various combinations are summarized in four tables (see below).
"If the verb of the main clause is in the past (simple past, imperfect, or past perfect), the verbal forms of the subordinate clause refer to the moment indicated in the main clause and adapt accordingly. The present in the subordinate clase will transform to imperfect, the past will become past perfect, etc.:"
"Despite of the use of the subjunctive, the verbal tenses follow rules similar to the ones of the Indicative mood. The Present Indicative of the subordinate clause will be substituted with the subjunctive present; similarly, the present perfect will be substituted with its correspondent form, that of the past subjunctive and the Past perfect tense with the subjunctive past perfect."
"If the verb of the main clause is in the past tense, the verbal forms of the subordinate will be adapted to that of the main clause:"
= = = Rock-cut architecture = = =
"Rock-cut architecture is the creation of structures, buildings, and sculptures by excavating solid rock where it naturally occurs. Rock-cut architecture is designed and made by man from the start to finish. In India and China, the terms ""cave"" and ""cavern"" are often applied to this form of man-made architecture. However, caves and caverns, that began in natural form, are not considered to be 'rock-cut architecture' even if extensively modified. Although rock-cut structures differ from traditionally built structures in many ways, many rock-cut structures are made to replicate the facade or interior of traditional architectural forms. Interiors were usually carved out by starting at the roof of the planned space and then working downward. This technique prevents stones falling on workers below. The three main uses of rock-cut architecture were temples (like those in India), tombs (like those in Petra, Jordan) and cave dwellings (like those in Cappadocia, Turkey)."
"Some rock-cut architecture, mostly for tombs, is excavated entirely in chambers under the surface of relatively level rock. If the excavation is instead made into the side of a cliff or steep slope, there can be an impressive facade, as found in Lycian tombs, Petra, Ajanta and elsewhere. The most laborious and impressive rock-cut architecture is the excavation of tall free-standing monolithic structures entirely below the surface level of the surrounding rock, in a large excavated hole around the structure. Ellora in India and Lalibela in Ethiopia (built by the Zagwe dynasty) provide the most spectacular and famous examples of such structures."
"Rock-cut architecture, though intensely laborious with ancient tools and methods, was presumably combined with quarrying the rock for use elsewhere; the huge amounts of stone removed have normally vanished from the site. Rock-cut architecture is also said to be cut, hewn, etc., ""from the living rock"". Another term sometimes associated with rock-cut architecture is monolithic architecture, which is rather applied to free-standing structures made of a single piece of material. Monolithic architecture is often rock-cut architecture (e.g. Ellora Kailasanathar Temple) but monolithic structures might be also cast of artificial material, e.g. concrete."
"The Gommateshwara statue (Bahubali), the largest monolithic statue in the world, at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka, India, was built in 983 AD and was carved from a large single block of granite. In many parts of the world there are also rock reliefs, relief sculptures carved into rock faces, outside caves or at other sites."
"Ancient monuments of rock-cut architecture are widespread in several regions of world. Alteration of naturally formed caverns, although distinct from completely carved structures in the strict sense, date back to the neolithic period on several Mediterranean islands e.g. Malta (Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni), Sardinia (Anghelu Ruju, built between 3,000 and 1,500 BCE) and others."
"Large-scale rock-cut structures were built in Ancient Egypt. Among these monuments was the Great Temple of Ramesses II, known as Abu Simbel, located along the Nile in Nubia, near the borders of Sudan about 300 kilometers from Aswan in Egypt. It dates from about the 19th Dynasty (ca. 1280 BCE), and consists of a monumentally scaled facade carved out of the cliff and a set of interior chambers that form its sanctuary."
"In the 8th century, the Phrygians started some of the earliest rock-cut monuments, such as the Midas monument (700 BCE), dedicated to the famous Phrygian king Midas."
"In the 5th century BCE, the Lycians, who inhabited southern Anatolia (now Turkey) built hundreds of rock-cut tombs of a similar type, but smaller in scale. Excellent examples are to be found near Dalyan, a town in Muğla Province, along the sheer cliffs that faces a river. Since these served as tombs rather than as religious sites, the interiors were usually small and unassuming. The ancient Etruscans of central Italy also left an important legacy of rock-cut architecture, mostly tombs, as those near the cities of Tarquinia and Vulci."
The creation of rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel began in the 8th-century BCE and continued through the Byzantine period. The Tomb of Absalom was constructed in the 1st century AD in the Kidron Valley of Jerusalem.
"Rock-cut architecture occupies a particularly important place in the history of Indian Architecture. The earliest instances of Indian rock-cut architecture, the Barabar caves, date from about the 3rd to the 2nd century BCE. They were built by the Buddhist monks and consisted mostly of multi-storey buildings carved into the mountain face to contain living and sleeping quarters, kitchens, and monastic spaces. Some of these monastic caves had shrines in them to the Buddha, bodhisattvas and saints. As time progressed, the interiors became more elaborate and systematized; surfaces were often decorated with paintings, such as those at Ajanta. At the beginning of the 7th century Hindu rock-cut temples began to be constructed at Ellora. Unlike most previous examples of rock-cut architecture which consisted of a facade plus an interior, these temples were complete three-dimensional buildings created by carving away the hillside. They required several generations of planning and coordination to complete. Other major examples of rock-cut architecture in India are at Ajanta and Pataleshwar."
"The Nabataeans in their city of Petra, now in Jordan, extended the Western Asian tradition, carving their temples and tombs into the yellowish-orange rock that defines the canyons and gullies of the region. These structures, dating from 1st century BCE to about 2nd century CE, are particularly important in the history of architecture given their experimental forms. Here too, because the structures served as tombs, the interiors were rather perfunctory. In Petra one even finds a theater where the seats are cut out of the rock."
"The technological skills associated with making these complex structures moved into China along the trade routes. The Longmen Grottoes, the Mogao Caves, and the Yungang Grottoes consist of hundreds of caves many with statues of Buddha in them. Most were built between 460–525 AD. There are extensive rock-cut buildings, including houses and churches in Cappadocia, Turkey. They were built over a span of hundreds of years prior to the 5th century CE. Emphasis here was more on the interiors than the exteriors."
"Another extensive site of rock-cut architecture is in Lalibela, a town in northern Ethiopia. The area contains numerous Orthodox churches in three dimensions, as at Ellora, that were carved out of the rock. These structures, which date from the 12th and 13th centuries CE and which are the last significant examples of this architectural form, ranks as among the most magnificent examples of rock-cut architecture in the world, with both interior and exterior brought to fruition."
"Ancient rock cut tombs, temples and monasteries often have been adorned with frescoes and reliefs. The high resistance of natural cliff, skilled use of plaster and constant microclimate often have helped to preserve this art in better condition than in conventional buildings. Such exceptional examples are the ancient and early medieval frescoes in such locations as Bamyan Caves in Afghanistan with the most ancient known oil paintings in the world from 8th century AD, Ajanta Caves in India with well preserved tempera paintings from 2nd century BCE, Christian frescoes on Churches of Göreme, Turkey and numerous other monuments in Asia, Europe and Africa."

= = = Cooking spray = = =
"Cooking spray is a spray form of an oil as a lubricant, lecithin as an emulsifier, and a propellant such as food-grade alcohol, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide or propane. Cooking spray is applied to frying pans and other cookware to prevent food from sticking. Traditionally, cooks used butter, shortening, or oils poured or rubbed on cookware. Most cooking sprays have less food energy per serving than an application of vegetable oil, because they are applied in a much thinner layer: US regulations allow many to be labelled ""zero-calorie""; in the UK sprays claim to supply ""less than 1 calorie per serving"". Popular US brands include Pam, Crisco, and Baker's Joy. Sprays are available with plain vegetable oil, butter and olive oil flavor."
Cooking spray has other culinary uses besides being applied to cookware. Sticky candies such as Mike and Ike that are often sold in bulk vending machines may be sprayed with cooking spray to keep them from sticking together in the machines. Coating the inside of a measuring cup with the spray allows sticky substances such as honey to pour out more easily. Vegetables may be sprayed before seasoning to make the seasonings stick better.
= = = Diocesan chancery = = =
A diocesan chancery is the branch of administration which handles all written documents used in the official government of a Catholic or Anglican diocese.
"It is in the diocesan chancery that, under the direction of the bishop or his representative, all documents which concern the diocese are drawn up, copied, forwarded, and a record kept of all official writings expedited or received."
The official charged with the execution of these duties is known as the diocesan chancellor.
"Diocesan chanceries may be universal, but there is nothing in the common ecclesiastical law concerning their creation and equipment. The explanation lies in the very nature of this law, which provides only for what is general and common, and takes no account of local means of administration, which it abandons to the proper authority in each diocese, the concrete circumstances offering always great variety and calling for all possible freedom of action."
"Although, as above described, the methods of diocesan administration exhibit no little variety, there exists on the other hand a certain uniformity. Each diocese, after all, is bound to observe the common law, has an identical range of freedom, and identical limits to its authority. Each diocese, therefore, is likely, ""a priori"", to develop its administration along similar lines, but does so regularly in harmony with others, particularly neighbouring dioceses. In this way the dioceses of a given country come to have similar official administration."
"In many dioceses, the chancellor exercises some of the faculties which in other dioceses are exclusively reserved to the vicar-general. This happens more frequently in smaller dioceses, administered directly by the bishop himself, and in which the vicar-general (often not resident in the episcopal city) is called on only when the bishop is absent or hindered."
"In such cases the chancellor is also the confidential secretary of the bishop. A similar system obtains even in many extensive dioceses which are administered by the bishop with the aid of one or more vicars-general and the diocesan chancery. There are, however, some large dioceses in which all matters personally reserved to the bishop are executed by him with the aid of a secretary or chancellor, usually a priest or deacon, while the greater part of the diocesan administration is handed over to a body of officials under the direction of the bishop or his vicar-general."
"For the correspondence, registration, and care of the archives, such administrative bureaus are provided with a secretariat or chancery. The chancery is a necessary element of administration in every diocese. Some provision for its duties must be made, even in missionary dioceses, apostolic prefectures, and apostolic vicariates. Unless the official correspondence were properly cared for, there would be no tradition in diocesan management, important documents would be lost, and the written evidence necessary in lawsuits and trials would be lacking."
"The famous Apostolic Chancery (""Cancellaria Apostolica"") developed in time from the chancery of the primitive Bishop of Rome. By reason of the latter's primacy in the Church, his chancery naturally had far wider relations than that of any other Christian diocese. The Apostolic See had never legislated concerning diocesan chanceries until the 1983 Code of Canon Law under its canons on the diocesan curia (cc. 469-494). The diocesan system was generally introduced in many countries whose churches had hitherto been under a more or less provisional government (e.g. United States, England, Scotland, India)."
"National and provincial synods laid much stress on the creation of diocesan chanceries. In the United States, the First Plenary Council of Baltimore (1852) expressed the wish that in every diocese there should be a chancery, to facilitate ecclesiastical administration and establish for its conduct a more or less identical system. In Ireland, the National Synod of Thurles (1850) made provision for the establishment and preservation of diocesan archives. Similarly for England the Provincial Synod of Westminster (1852)."
"In keeping with these recommendations, the diocesan chancery consists of a certain number of officials named by the bishop. In the United States, England, and Australia, there are usually, besides the vicar-general, a diocesan chancellor and a secretary. In European dioceses the chancery is organized variously, according to the extent of the diocese. There is generally in each diocese a chancellor or secretary with the necessary personnel."
"In the dioceses of Germany much of the administration is carried on by an official bureau (""Ordinariat"") as described above, i.e., the vicariate-general, to which are adjoined a secretariat, a registry office, and a chancery."
"In the Diocese of Breslau there existed an institution known as the ""Secret Chancery"" (""Geheimkanzlei""), which expedited only matters decided by the prince-bishop personally or with the advice of this body. The prince-bishop presided over its sessions with the help of the vicar-general. Its members were three priests and one lay counsellor to whom were added a secretary, a chief of the chancery, two private secretaries, a registrar, etc. The ordinary diocesan administration were carried on by two other bureaus, the vicariate-general and the diocesan consistory, mutually independent, but both acting in the name of the prince-bishop."
"For the office of diocesan chancellor in the United States, see ""Acta et Decreta"" of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, in index, p. 303, and of the Synod of Maynooth (1900), s. v. ""Archiva""."
= = = Alpha Kappa Delta Phi = = =
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi (αΚΔΦ) (also known as aKDPhi) is an Asian-interest sorority founded at the University of California, Berkeley. alpha Kappa Delta Phi is part of the National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA), which it helped charter in 2006. alpha Kappa Delta Phi currently has 57 chapters in North America, and is the largest Asian-American interest sorority in the United States and Canada."
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1989 and recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. There were fourteen founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, and they dedicated themselves ""to establishing a sorority which would offer Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system while also establishing an organization which would last as a strong tradition. ""."
"During the fall of 2002, the National Alumnae Board was established under the guidance of the National Board Alumnae Chair, Sophia Yen, to oversee the expansion and growth of the sorority’s alumnae. The 2002-2003 National Alumnae Board strongly desired a working organization that would provide programs and services to all alumnae. This idea later blossomed into the formation of the National Alumnae Association. With a true grassroots beginning, the National Alumnae Board’s initial activity focused on creating a mentoring program that would drive rich learning and development for both mentees and mentors. The success of the mentorship initiative led to the addition of a scholarship program that would award financial aid to sisters looking to further their education. Over the years, the National Alumnae Board has proudly sponsored many programs to edify our alumnae in helping them pursue their dreams, passions, and legacies. To date, the National Alumnae Association is still holding fast to its purpose: to continue the sisterhood after graduation. As such, it remains the leading avenue for our alumnae to connect with one another and express their timeless affection and everlasting devotion to alpha Kappa Delta Phi."
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi promotes Asian Awareness, one of its founding principles, by encouraging its members to be constantly aware of and involved in Asian American issues in their communities. Chapters host events such as forums, presentations, and workshops. Many of these events take place during May, which is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month."
alpha Kappa Delta Phi's national philanthropy is breast cancer awareness.
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi's breast cancer awareness campaign began in 1998, and its exclusive partnership with Avon began in 2010 and ended in 2017. The sorority hosts breast cancer awareness banquets, information sessions, workshops, and discussion groups. In 2006, the sorority raised over $30,000 as a national organization for breast cancer awareness. In 2008, the sorority raised and donated over $35,000. In 2012, the sorority raised and donated over $62,000. In 2016, the sorority raised and donated over $102,000, hitting the half of a million mark in terms of the total dollar amount donated to the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade since the start of their partnership in 2010."
"After ""The Excellent Dizzy Collection"" was released, the Oliver twins left Codemasters for another publisher and with the intellectual property split between Codemasters and the Oliver twins no more Dizzy games were ever produced, although both companies have since said they would like to revisit the series. ""Wonderland Dizzy"" was eventually released in 2015. ""Dreamworld Pogie"" remained unreleased until 2011 when an alpha build was somehow leaked online. An official release of the game finally occurred in 2017, following a successful Kickstarter campaign from the original creators."
"""Dizzy the Adventurer"" is an enhanced version of the previously released ""Dizzy Prince of the Yolkfolk"" that was bundled with the Aladdin Deck Enhancer for the Oliver twin's publisher (Codemasters/Camerica) ill-fated NES peripheral. The title had not previously been released on the Sega platforms so was originally going to be released as a stand-alone game but publisher Codemasters was uncomfortable releasing it at full price."
"The game was originally released as a stand-alone product, ""Dizzy Panic!"", for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, but was later included as a last-minute replacement for ""Wonderland Dizzy"". Codemasters felt that two adventure games should not be included on the one compilation, so the Oliver Twins decided to leave ""Dizzy the Adventurer"" and replace ""Wonderland Dizzy"" (which was eventually released in October 2015) with ""Panic Dizzy"" to complement the other two game styles."
"""Go! Dizzy Go!"" was originally to be released on the NES for the Aladdin; however, due to its unexpected failure, the title was then planned for release as a stand-alone title for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. However, the publisher, Codemasters, was uncomfortable releasing it separately at full price, so included it as part of ""The Excellent Dizzy Collection""."
"Quattro Arcade, released for the NES in 1992, featured Go! Dizzy Go!."
"The game is an arcade-style puzzle game where the player must navigate the Dizzy through a series of mazes similar to the ""Adventures of Lolo"" games."
= = = Primary progressive aphasia = = =
"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a type of neurological syndrome in which language capabilities slowly and progressively become impaired. As with other types of aphasia, the symptoms that accompany PPA depend on what parts of the left hemisphere are significantly damaged. However, unlike most other aphasias, PPA results from continuous deterioration in brain tissue, which leads to early symptoms being far less detrimental than later symptoms. Those with PPA slowly lose the ability to speak, write, read, and generally comprehend language. Eventually, almost every patient becomes mute and completely loses the ability to understand both written and spoken language. Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact, it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer from impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss of executive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.Marsel Mesulam in 1982. Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum of disorders and Alzheimer's disease. However, PPA is not considered synonymous to Alzheimer's disease due to the fact that, unlike those affected by Alzheimer's disease, those with PPA are generally able to maintain the ability to care for themselves, remain employed, and pursue interests and hobbies. Moreover, in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive deterioration of comprehension and production of language is just one of the many possible types of mental deterioration, such as the progressive decline of memory, motor skills, reasoning, awareness, and visuospatial skills."
"Currently, the specific causes for PPA and other degenerative brain disease similar to PPA are unknown. Autopsies have revealed a variety of brain abnormalities in people who had PPA. These autopsies, as well as imaging techniques such as CT scans, MRI, EEG, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), have generally revealed abnormalities to be almost exclusively in the left hemisphere."
"There have been no large epidemiological studies on the incidence and prevalence of the PPA variants. Though it most likely has been underestimated, onset of PPA has been found to occur in the sixth or seventh decade."
"There are no known environmental risk factors for the progressive aphasias. However, one observational, retrospective study suggested that vasectomy could be a risk factor for PPA in men. These results have yet to be replicated or demonstrated by prospective studies."
"PPA is not considered a hereditary disease. However, relatives of a person with any form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, including PPA, are at slightly greater risk of developing PPA or another form of the condition. In a quarter of patients diagnosed with PPA, there is a family history of PPA or one of the other disorders in the FTLD spectrum of disorders. It has been found that genetic predisposition varies among the different PPA variants, with PNFA being more commonly familial in nature than LPA or SD."
"The most convincing genetic basis of PPA has been found to be a mutation in the GRN gene. Most patients with observed GRN mutations present clinical features of PNFA, but the phenotype can be atypical."
The following diagnosis criteria were defined by Mesulam:
"Whether or not PPA and other aphasias are the only source of cognitive impairment in a patient is often difficult to assess because: 1) as with other neurologically degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, there are currently no reliable non-invasive diagnostic tests for aphasias, and thus neuropsychological assessments are the only tool physicians have for diagnosing patients; and 2) aphasias often affect other, non-language portions of these neuropsychological tests, such as those specific for memory."
"In 2011, The classification of primary progressive aphasia was updated to include three clinical variants. Patients must first be diagnosed with PPA, and then divided into variants based on speech production features, repetition, single- word and syntax comprehension, confrontation naming, semantic knowledge, and reading/spelling. In the classical Mesulam criteria for primary progressive aphasia, there are two variants: a non-fluent type progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and a fluent type semantic dementia (SD). A third variant of primary progressive aphasia, logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) was then added, and is an atypical form of Alzheimer's disease. For PNFA, The core criteria for diagnosis includes agrammatism and slow, and labored speech. Inconsistent speech sound errors are also very common, including distortions, deletions, and insertions. In terms of comprehension, there are deficits in syntax and sentence comprehension due to grammatical complexity, but single- word and object comprehension is relatively maintained. The second variant, SD, presents with deficits in single-word and object comprehension. Naming impairments can be severe, specially for low-frequency objects, and can eventually lead to a more widespread semantic memory deficiency over time. The ability to read and write can also be impaired if there are irregularities between pronunciation and spelling. However, repetition and motor speech is relatively preserved. The logopenic variant involves impairments in word retrieval, sentence repetition, and phonological paraphasias, comparable to Conduction aphasia. Compared to the semantic variant, single word comprehension and naming is spared, however, sentence comprehension presents difficulty because of length and grammatical complexity. Speech will include incomplete words, hesitations preceding content words, and repetition. However, these PPA subtypes differ from similar aphasias, as these subtypes do not occur acutely following trauma to the brain, such as following a stroke, due to differing functional and structural neuroanatomical patterns of involvement and the progressive nature of the disease."
"Due to the progressive, continuous nature of the disease, improvement over time seldom occurs in patients with PPA as it often does in patients with aphasias caused by trauma to the brain."
"In terms of medical approaches to treating PPA, there are currently no drugs specifically used for patients with PPA, nor are there any specifically designed interventions for PPA. A large reason for this is the limited research that has been done on this disease. However, in some cases, patients with PPA are prescribed the same drugs Alzheimer's patients are normally prescribed."
"The primary approach to treating PPA has been with behavioral treatment, with the hope that these methods can provide new ways for patients to communicate in order to compensate for their deteriorated abilities. Speech therapy can assist an individual with strategies to overcome difficulties. There are three very broad categories of therapy interventions for aphasia: restorative therapy approaches, compensatory therapy approaches, and social therapy approaches. Rapid and sustained improvement in speech and dementia in a patient with primary progressive aphasia utilizing off-label perispinal etanercept, an anti-TNF treatment strategy also used for Alzheimer's, has been reported. A video depicting the patient's improvement was published in conjunction with the print article. These findings have not been independently replicated and remain controversial."
"In September 2016, it was reported that Terry Jones of Monty Python had been diagnosed with the condition. He later passed away from complications of the disease on January 21, 2020."
M Marseille Mesulam coined the term primary progressive aphasia.

"Camp William James was opened in 1940 by Dartmouth College professor, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, as a center for training youth for leadership in the Civilian Conservation Corps, which had been inaugurated in 1933 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was located near Tunbridge, Vermont. Funding for the camp was withdrawn only a year after its founding, along with the rest of the CCC, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into World War II."
"The camp's namesake and inspiration was the pragmatic philosopher, William James, who delivered an influential address at Stanford University in 1906 with the title, ""The Moral Equivalent of War"". ""A permanently successful peace-economy cannot be a simple pleasure-economy"", James argued, ""Martial virtues must be the enduring cement; intrepidity, contempt of softness, surrender of private interest, obedience to command, must still remain the rock upon which states are built."" To devote oneself to these martial virtues in the service of others, taking up the menial tasks of society like an army at war for the sake of peace, is a force equal to war, James argued. Rosenstock-Huessy took up this theme, calling the young men who enlisted in the ""Camp"" program, ""soldiers""."
