"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King .
She turned and walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its inhabitants .
"If Alan had troubled himself to look , he would have seen a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes ."
But the only eyes which had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver .
"* * * * * During Alan 's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde , either in the house or out of it ."
This surprised and worried him .
"There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony , who continued to be suave and friendly ."
"Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the Captain , who was witty , incisive , and pungent ; yet he disliked the man himself more at every visit ."
"If he had been compelled to define his impression , he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel ."
But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something .
"Sometimes he caught her glance , full of perplexity and -- it almost seemed -- distrust ."
She looked as if she felt hostile towards him .
But Alan dismissed the idea as absurd .
She had been friendly from the first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval .
Lynde 's mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem .
"She had not gone away , for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her , he responded indifferently that she was out walking ."
Alan caught a glint of amusement in the older man 's eyes as he spoke .
He could have sworn it was malicious amusement .
One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore .
"As he turned the headland of the cove , he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet away ."
The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared among the firs .
Alan was thunderstruck .
There was no room for doubt that she meant to avoid him .
He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings which he did not even then understand .
He only realized that he felt bitterly hurt and grieved -- puzzled as well .
What did it all mean ?
He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and stopped her resolutely .
"`` Miss Oliver , '' he said bluntly , `` is Miss Lynde angry with me ?"
And why ? ''
Emily looked at him piercingly .
`` Have you no idea why ? ''
she asked shortly .
This was seeing ; it was not hearing .
He means foully .
"Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! ''"
Such was the case .
The bell rang no longer .
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I like not that ."
"Nay , '' he cried again , `` I like that little ."
What may this betoken ?
"Let us go , by the mass ! ''"
"`` He hath gone east , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . ''"
"`` Jack , y ' are too cowardly , '' replied Dick ."
"`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''"
"They were afoot at once , passed the stream upon some stepping-stones , and began to mount on the other side , which was steeper , towards the margin of the wood ."
"The ground became very uneven , full of knolls and hollows ; trees grew scattered or in clumps ; it became difficult to choose a path , and the lads somewhat wandered ."
"They were weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertions and the lack of food , and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand ."
"Presently , coming to the top of a knoll , they were aware of the leper , some hundred feet in front of them , crossing the line of their march by a hollow ."
"His bell was silent , his staff no longer tapped the ground , and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees ."
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket .
"The lads , at the first glimpse , had crouched behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck ."
"`` Certain , he pursueth us , '' said Dick -- `` certain !"
"He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?"
that it should not sound .
"Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''"
`` What maketh he ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
"Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ?"
"Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?"
"Dick , there is below this something deeper . ''"
"`` Nay , I care not , '' moaned Dick ; `` the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water ."
The saints be mine assistance ! ''
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
"Things were very much unsettled. England had not sent a minister to this country, and had arranged no commercial treaty with us."
Washington's Cabinet consisted of three portfolios and a rack in which he kept his flute-music.
"The three ministers were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Treasury. There was no Attorney-General, or Postmaster-General, or Secretary of the Interior, or of the Navy, or Seed Catalogue Secretary."
"Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, advised that Congress at the earliest moment provide itself with a national debt, which was done, the war debt being assumed by the Congressional representatives of the thirteen Colonies."
"A tax was levied on spirits, and a mint started, combining the two, and making the mint encourage the consumption of spirits, and thus the increase of the tax, very likely."
"A Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794. Pennsylvania especially rebelled at the tax on this grocery, but it was put down. (Those wishing to know which was put down will find out by consulting the Appendix, which will be issued a year from this winter.)"
"A few Indian wars now kept the people interested, and a large number of the red brothers, under Little Turtle, soon found themselves in the soup, as Washington put it so tersely in his message the following year."
Twenty-five thousand square miles north of the Ohio were obtained by treaty from the Indians.
"England claimed that traffic with America was not desirable, as the Americans did not pay their debts. Possibly that was true, for muskrat pelts were low at that time, and England refused to take cord-wood and saw-logs piled on the New York landing as cash."
"Chief-Justice Jay was sent to London to confer with the king, which he did. He was not invited, however, to come to the house during his stay, and the queen did not call on Mrs. Jay. The Jays have never recovered from this snub, and are still gently guyed by the comic papers."
"But the treaty was negotiated, and now the Americans are said to pay their debts as well as the nobility who marry our American girls instead of going into bankruptcy, as some would do."
"The Mississippi and the Mediterranean Sea were opened for navigation to American vessels now, and things looked better, for we could by this means exchange our cranberries for sugar and barter our Indian relics for camel's-hair shawls, of which the pioneers were very much in need during the rigorous winters in the North."
"The French now had a difficulty with England, and Washington, who still remembered La Fayette and the generous aid of the French, wished that he was back at Mount Vernon, working out his poll-tax on the Virginia roads, for he was in a tight place."
"It was now thought best to have two political parties, in order to enliven editorial thought and expression. So the Republican party, headed by Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, and the Federalist party, led by Hamilton and Adams, were organized, and public speakers were engaged from a distance."
"The latter party supported the administration, which was not so much of a job as it has been several times since."
"Washington declined to accept a third term, and wrote a first-rate farewell address. A lady, whose name is withheld, writing of those times, closes by saying that President Washington was one of the sweetest men she ever knew."
"John Adams succeeded Washington as President, and did not change his politics to amount to much."
"He made a good record as Congressman, but lost it as President largely because of his egotism. He seemed to think that if he neglected to oil the gearing of the solar system about so often, it would stop running."
We should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority.
"Adams and Jefferson were good friends during the Revolution, but afterwards political differences estranged them till they returned to private life. Adams was a poor judge of men, and offended several members of the press who called on him to get his message in advance."
"Our country was on the eve of a war with France, when Napoleon I. was made Consul, and peace followed."
"Adams's administration made the Federalists unpopular, owing to the Alien and Sedition laws, and Jefferson was elected the successor of Adams, Burr running as Vice-President with him. The election was so close that it went to the House, however."
"Jefferson, or the Sage of Monticello, was a good President, noted for his simplicity. He married and brought his bride home to Monticello prior to this. She had to come on horseback about one hundred miles, and, as the house was unfinished and no servants there, they had to sleep on the work-bench and eat what was left of the carpenter's lunch."
"Jeffersonian simplicity was his strong point, and people who called at the White House often found him sprinkling the floor of his office, or trying to start a fire with kerosene."
"Burr was Vice-President, and, noticing at once that the office did not attract any attention to speak of, decided to challenge Mr. Alexander Hamilton to fight a duel with him."
"The affair took place at Weehawken, July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell at the first fire, on the same spot where his eldest son had been killed in the same way."
"The artist has shown us how Burr and Hamilton should have fought, but, alas! they were not progressive men and did not realize this till too late. Another method would have been to use the bloodless method of the French duel, or the newspaper customs adopted by the pugilists of 1893."
The time is approaching when mortal combat in America will be confined to belligerent people under the influence of liquor. A newspaper assault instead of a duel might have made Burr President and Hamilton Vice-President.
"Burr went West, and was afterwards accused of treason on the ground that he was trying to organize Mexico against the United States government."
"""Who run?"" inquired Wolfe."
"""The French! The French!"" came the reply."
"""Now God be praised,"" said Wolfe, ""I die happy."""
"Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. ""They run!"
"They run!"" he heard some one say."
"""Who run?"" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of cognac."
"""We do,"" replied the man."
"""Then so much the better,"" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, ""for I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."""
This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian has to control himself in order to avoid lying.
"The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in the history of our country, and should be remembered by every school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the other."
"Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag floated."
What an empire!
What a game-preserve!
"Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the poor."
"Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief."
"The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way, and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is deserving of more than a passing notice."
"The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur."
"These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able also to survey a county or rule a nation."
CHAPTER XII.
PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.
It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history will more fully appear.
"The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a glue-factory on the side of the river."
"A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to be held in the future the work will be on sale."
The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.
"George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates, playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then, in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer."
"We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid about trying it."
"When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips in their pockets."

CHAPTER III
LADY DEDMOND.  Without letting you know?
GEORGE.  I believe she did tell me.
LADY DEDMOND.  But surely----
GEORGE.  I don't want to discuss it.  There's never anything in
"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."
"LADY DEDMOND.  I see.  [She looks shrewdly at her son]  My dear,"
"I should be rather careful about him, I think."
SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.
SIR CHARLES.  Oh!  That chap!
GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.
SIR CHARLES.  Um!  That's the worst of travellin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I think you ought to have dropped him.  These literary
"people---[Quietly]  From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't"
"says: ""Clare!""  Receiving no answer, he goes in.  PAYNTER"
"switches up the electric light.  His face, turned towards the"
"curtained door, is apprehensive."
GEORGE.  [Re-entering]  Where's Mrs. Dedmond?
"PAYNTER.  I hardly know, sir."
GEORGE.  Dined in?
"PAYNTER.  She had a mere nothing at seven, sir."
"GEORGE.  Has she gone out, since?"
"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir--that is, yes.  The--er--mistress was not dressed"
"at all.  A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir."
GEORGE.  What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
PAYNTER.  Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine;
"and Captain Huntingdon, too--Mr. and Mrs.  Fullarton might be a bit"
"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?
"PAYNTER.  Not to me, sir."
GEORGE.  Send Burney.
"PAYNTER.  Very good, sir.  [He withdraws.]"
GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables.  BURNEY comes in
"very far, George."
"SIR CHARLES.  We'll make him play Bridge.  Do him good, if he's that"
sort of fellow.
LADY DEDMOND.  Is anyone else coming?
"GEORGE.  Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Softly]  You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to"
speak to you for a long time.  It is such a pity you and Clare--What
is it?
"GEORGE.  God knows!  I try, and I believe she does."
"SIR CHARLES.  It's distressin'--for us, you know, my dear fellow--"
distressin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know it's been going on for a long time.
"GEORGE.  Oh!  leave it alone, mother."
"LADY DEDMOND.  But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a"
point--put ideas into her head.
GEORGE.  You can't dislike him more than I do.  But there's nothing
one can object to.
"LADY DEDMOND.  Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home?"

GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your

CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of

Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"

LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"
"Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?"
"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."

"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."

Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!

We have been able to find out nothing of this pirate except that he was at
New Providence Island in 1718 and took the King's pardon for pirates. He
"seems to have returned to the old life and was killed soon after, though"
how this came about is not recorded.
"""Yes, he was. Kilshaw seemed to know all about him."""
"""He was talking to Miss Medland."""
"""And the Premier had her away from him in no time. Queer start, Sir"

murdered for the money he had on him. But I mustn't talk about it. I may

They walked to the Piazza del Popólo and through the Via Babuino to the
Piazza di Spagna.
“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.
"Cæsar asked him where they manufactured those religious toys, and the"
pedlar told him in Westphalia.
"""I don't know. Why?"""
"""I wonder if I could get one."""
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Don't you think it might attract people to the place? Oh, well, perhaps"
"it wouldn't."""
And Paul withdrew.
Madder than ever. Some people see flies. Paul saw goldfish.

The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....
It was a Saturday evening. I stood talking to the lawyer in the garden; he
"didn't like the place, and wanted to leave, but Miss Torsen would not go"
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
"Entman's little eyes shone with affection. ""I can only wish you good"
"luck."""
"""Thanks. I'll need it."""
"""And one more thing I was wondering."""
"""What's that?"""
"""Why do you suppose the tenth android killed the one in the Village?"""
"""Another case of taking one reason for want of a better one. I think it"
was his way of delivering the creature to us for research. He couldn't
"know for sure that we already had his 'brothers.'"""
"""You're right--you must be,"" Entman agreed."
"""Small consolation. I'd like a few facts to go on for a change instead"
"of having to depend on logic all the time,"" Taber growled."
"""What are you referring to?"""
"""The data. I'm assuming, _if_ that's what's important, that the tenth"
"creature has a way of getting the stuff back up there."""
"""I can help a little on that,"" Entman said. ""I can assure you that from"
"what I've found in those brains, the data could, most likely, be sent"
"mentally."""
"""You're sure of that?"""
passing reference to yesterday's tragedy.
"""I didn't like him at all,"" she said; ""but still it's dreadful--a man"
"one knew ever so slightly!"""
"Alicia agreed, and the next instant she found herself practically alone"
with Medland; for Daisy ran off to pick a wild-flower that caught her
"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.
"""Mr. Medland!"""
"""Yes?"""
"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"""He'll take offense,"" the lawyer murmured, considering the matter."
But Solem urged him on:
"""I don't think so. Anyhow, you were the first one to talk about it."""
"""Everybody here will know, and I'll be prevented,"" said the lawyer."
"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—

"The Superintendent was about to answer in the negative, when a detective"

They both tittered.

"""How long will that be?"" Slyne inquired. He, too, was smiling"
ecstatically.
"""Not much more than a fortnight,"" the lawyer informed him. ""It will soon"
"pass. We must just be patient."""
"""We must keep very quiet, too,"" said Slyne, ""unless we want to give the"

CHAPTER XVI
"""PLEASURES AND PALACES"""
"The Duchess of Dawn was dining a number of notabilities at the Savoy, on"
her way to a command performance at the Gaiety; a fact of which the
"“Oh, but I assure you--they told me it was to be a fancy-dress affair.”"
Rippley bawled at the door:
“Sir Gilders Cinnamon!”
Sir Gilders Persimmon shuffled into the room; and Pangbutt went to meet
the old baronet.
"“Lady Persimmon coming to-night, Sir Gilders?” he shouted into his ear;"
the old man shook his head.
"“Sorry,” bawled Pangbutt into his ear; “Sir Gilders, allow me to"
"introduce Mr. Fosse, who, I need not tell you, is the well-known"
critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” cried Fosse, getting very hot--“I did not say"
borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”
"""Exactly. Now read this,"" and he gave him the copy of a certificate of"
marriage between George Benyon and Margaret Aspland.
"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"
"will be necessary to protract it."""
"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"
"here, Superintendent, I don't want that more talked about than"
"necessary."""
"""You needn't say a word to me now unless you like, sir; but I only want"
"to make things as comfortable as I can. You see, the coroner is bound to"
"look into it a bit. Had you given him money lately?"""

"""Come along, Flemyng,"" he said. ""The show's over for to-night."""
"He seemed to express the general feeling, but men were reluctant to"
"acknowledge so disappointing a conclusion, and the preparations for"
departure were slow and lingering. They had not fairly begun before Mr.
Kilshaw's entrance abruptly checked them. Instantly he became the centre
of a crowd.
"""Now, Kilshaw,"" they cried, ""you know all about it. Oh, come now! Of"
"course you do! Secret? Nonsense! Out with it!"" and one or two of his"
"intimates added imploringly, ""Don't be an ass, Kilshaw."""
Kilshaw flung himself into a chair.
"""They resign,"" he said."
"""At once?"""
"""Yes. Perry's to be sent for. Medland, I'm told, insists on going. For"
"my own part, I think he's right."""
"""Of course,"" said somebody sapiently, ""he doesn't want to dissolve with"
"this affair hanging over him."""
"""It comes to the same thing,"" observed Kilshaw. ""Perry will dissolve;"
"the Governor has promised to do it, if he likes."""
"""Perry dissolve!"""
"""Yes,"" nodded Kilshaw. ""You see--"" He paused and added, ""Our present"
"position isn't very independent."""
"she did so--""I suppose you've been too full of your politics to hear"
"much about the murder?"""
"""The murder?"" exclaimed the watchmaker. The doorkeeper crumpled up his"
"letter and stuffed it into the pocket of his coat, while his wife read"
to them the story of the discovery. The watchmaker listened with
interest.
"""Benham!"" he remarked. ""I never heard the name, did you?"""
"""You know him, Ned,"" said the doorkeeper's wife; ""him as Mr. Gaspard"
"used to go about with."""
"By a sudden common impulse, the eyes of the two men met; the woman went"
"off to brew them a pot of tea, and left them fearfully gazing at one"
another.
"""What stuff!"" said the watchmaker uneasily. ""It was only his blow. What"
"reason had he--?"" He paused and added, ""Seen him to-day, Ned?"""
"""No,"" answered Ned, fingering his note."
"""Wasn't he in the procession?"""
"""I didn't see him."""
"""When did you see him last?"""
The doorkeeper hesitated.
"""Night of our last committee,"" he whispered finally."
"adjusting the guts. Er--how're you feeling?"""
"""Tired and frustrated."""
"""Mind a bad joke?"""
"""Well--"""
"""Go on and have a laugh, Wilson. This gizmo reminded me of the new"
machine that made shoes so fast that it put twelve shoemakers out of
"work--and it took only eighteen men to run it."""
A silence ensued. Then Stone said:
"""Well, Wilson, I thought you'd like to know we're pouring the best"
we've got into space for you. Ship should be along in another hour or
"two."""
"""Yeah--thanks, Admiral Stone. And the joke was funny, at least the"

"""Mrs. Fiorsen."""
"""Ow!""  The sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly; he twisted a"

"""Take a seat, won't you?"""
Gyp shook her head.
In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
"primitive emotion.  Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew"
"his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,"
muttered:
"""Go upstairs."""
"The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped"
"up Gyp's rage against men.  When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his"
throat; the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously
thick linings.
He said more gruffly than ever:

"""I came to see your daughter."""

The waiter came bringing Cæsar’s breakfast. “Will you tell me what it
"is?” said Cæsar to the ecclesiastic, while he filled his cup."
"The monk waited until the waiter was gone, and then said in a hard"
voice:
“His Eminence the Cardinal sent me to bid you not to present yourself
"anywhere again, giving his name.”"
"“What? What does this mean?” asked Cæsar, calmly."
“It means that His Eminence has found out about your intrigues and
machinations.”
“Intrigues? What intrigues were those?”
“You know perfectly well. And His Eminence forbids you to continue in
that direction.”
“His Eminence forbids me to pay calls? And for what reason?”
“Because you have used his name to introduce yourself into certain
places.”
“It is not true.”
“You have told people you went to that you are Cardinal Fort’s nephew.”
"“And I am not?” asked Cæsar, after taking a swallow of coffee."
"“You are trying to make use of the relationship, we don’t know with what"
end in view.”
"The old man became all the more frightened, and glanced at his face."
"""You are lying!"" he said scornfully, when the teacher had finished."
"""What lie have I told?"" asked the teacher."
"""You mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the Bible."""
"He got up and walked away, angry and deeply insulted."
"""You will go mad, Tyapa,"" called the teacher after him with conviction."
"Then the old man came back again, and stretching out his hand,"
threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger.
"""God made Adam--from Adam were descended the Jews, that means that all"
"people are descended from Jews ... and we also ..."""
"""Well?"""
"""Tartars are descended from Ishmael, but he also came of the Jews ..."""
"""What do you want to tell me all this for?"""
"""Nothing!  Only why do you tell lies?""  Then he walked away, leaving"
his companion in perplexity.  But after two days he came again and sat
by him.
"""You are learned ...  Tell me, then, whose descendants are we? Are we"
"Babylonians, or who are we?"""
"""We are Slavs, Tyapa,"" said the teacher, and attentively awaited his"

"The horseman looked for a moment in Francesco's face but, hardened as"
"he was, he dared not abide the trial. There was such a stare of"
"desperate calm in the dark eyes, that his courage failed and quailed"
from the truth. He hung his head and stood mute.
"""I listen--"""
"""My lord--"""
"""For God's sake, speak out!"""
"""My lord--"""
"""The truth!""--"
"""She lives--"""
"A great silence fell within the hearts of the three, an ecstasy of"
"silence, such as comes after the wail of a storm. The duke's lips were"
"compressed, as if he feared to give expression to his feelings."
Francesco's face was as the face of one who thrusts back hope out of
"his soul. He sat rigid on his horse, a stone image fronting Fate,"
"grim-eyed and steadfast. All his life had been one long sacrifice, one"
"long denial,--had it all been in vain?"
There were tears in the eyes of the man-at-arms.
"""What more?"""
"patriotism; as I say, it is an experimental form.”"
Kennedy looked at Cæsar with curiosity.
“And how can it help you with your plans to stay here in Rome?” he
asked.
“It can help me. In Spain nobody knows me. This is the only place where
"I have a certain position, through being the nephew of a Cardinal. I am"
trying to build on that. How am I going to arrange it? I don’t know. I
"am feeling out my future course, taking soundings.”"
"“But the support you could find here would be all of a clerical nature,”"
said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”
"“You are not taking it into account, my dear Cæsar, that the Church is"
still powerful and that it doesn’t pardon people who impose upon it.”
“Bah! I am not afraid of it.”
"“And you were just saying you are not courageous! You are courageous, my"
"dear man.... After this, I don’t doubt of your success.”"
“I need data.”
"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground."
"""Self is my name,"" said the woman."
"That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull"
"the fire apart. Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built"
"it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while"
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the
"fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground. Then"
"the latter screamed and ran away, crying:"
"""Father, father! Self burned me!"""
"""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"" came the"
answer from below the hill.
NOTE.
"""Self Did It"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 10. From the"
"vicinity of Sandakar, told by a half-grown boy) belongs to the"

There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"
impression of ginger whiskers and large boots.  Do we know anybody
"like that?"""
"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"
"know about his boots."""
"""But what could he have been doing up there?  Unless----"""
There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.
"""You're quite right, Hyacinth,"" he said sternly; ""it _was_ the King of"
"Barodia."""
Hyacinth looked troubled.
"""He oughtn't to come over anybody's breakfast table quite so quickly"

"“Are you sure he did it?” asked Kennedy, more, I felt, for its moral"
effect on her than through any doubt in his own mind.
"“Not sure. But then the wall safe shows no marks, and the replica is"
gone.”
“Might I see your jewel case?” he asked.
“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably
have to fuss a long time with the combination.”
In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"
"drumming absently on the arms of his chair, suddenly rose and walked"
quietly over to a scrap basket that stood beside an escritoire. It had
"evidently just been emptied, for the rooms must have been cleaned"
several hours before. He bent down over it and picked up two scraps of
paper adhering to the wicker work. The rest had evidently been thrown
away.
I bent over to read them. One was:

—dying to see—
The other read:

And the voice was gone.

"Control, he could already feel the adrenaline beginning to build."
Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was
"“Cheer up, Andrew,” he cried."
Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”
"""I can't."""
"""She'll be hurt, Alicia. She'll think you don't care. Come, dear."""
"""Tell her--tell her I'm coming directly. Eleanor, you must let me go,"""
and breaking away she fled into the house.
Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"
"she summed up her impressions by remarking,"
"""Well, I suppose one might."""

THE STORY OF A PHOTOGRAPH.
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"
"Slyne's as if, Sallie thought, for some sign that that shaft had hit"
home.
"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"

afterwards wrote a book relating his adventures on a journey on foot of
240 miles on the mainland of America.
"PORTER, CAPTAIN."
"A West Indian pirate, who commanded a sloop, and, in company with a"
"Captain Tuckerman in another sloop, came one day into Bennet's Key in"

He climbed the steps of the brownstone and tried the knob. The door
"opened. He went inside and found himself in a drab, dark hall furnished"
"with an umbrella stand, a worn carpet, and a table spread with mail."
"There was a bell on the table. He tapped it and, after a lazy length of"
"time, a shapeless woman came through a door on the right and regarded"
him with no great show of cordiality.
"""Nothing vacant, mister. Everything I've got is rented."""
"""I wasn't looking for a room. I'm just doing a little checking."""
"""My license is okay,"" the woman said belligerently. ""The place is clean"
"and orderly."""
"""That's not what I'm checking about. There's been some counterfeit money"
"passed in this neighborhood and we're trying to trace it down."""
The woman had a pronounced mustache that quivered at this news.
"""Counterfeit! My roomers are honest."""
"""I'm sure they are. But some people carry counterfeit money without"
"knowing it. Do they all pay in cash?"""
"""Only two of them."""
"""Men or women?"""
"""One girl--Katy Wynn."""
"She smiled, rather superciliously I thought."
"""But how did the terrible affair occur?"""
"""We have no idea,"" answered the Countess brokenly.  ""She was found lying"
upon the floor of the salon within a quarter of an hour of the departure
"of her visitor, who proved to be yourself.  Jean, the valet-de-chambre,"
"on entering, discovered her lying there, quite dead."""
"""Astounding!""  I gasped.  ""She was in perfect health when I left her."""
"She shook her head sorrowfully, and her voice, choking with grief,"
declared:
"""My child has been killed--murdered!"""
"""Murdered!  Impossible!""  I cried."
"""But she has,"" she declared.  ""I am absolutely positive of it!"""
CHAPTER SIX.
A PIECE OF PLAIN PAPER.
"""What medical examination has been made?""  I demanded."
"""None,"" responded the Countess.  ""My poor child is dead, and no doctor"
"can render her assistance.  Medical aid is unavailing."""
"""But do you mean to say that on making this discovery you did not think"
"it necessary to send for a doctor?""  I cried incredulously."
Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"
French newspapers.”
Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”
"“I can’t,” drawled Ffolliott miserably--“I am quite angry with"
Rippley--he told me it was a fancy-dress affair--and----”

already prepared a notification to the court of the withdrawal of the

if experiencing an unpleasant sensation.
"""Pardon me ... sign it?  And why?"""
"""There is no difficulty about it ... write your Christian name and"

with his finger to the place for the signature.
"""Oh!  It is not that ...  I was alluding to the compensation I was to"
"get for my ground."""
"""But then this ground is of no use to you,"" said Petunikoff, calmly."
"""But it is mine!"" exclaimed the soldier."
"""Of course, and how much do you want for it?"""
"""Well, say the amount stated in the document,"" said Vaviloff, boldly."
"""Six hundred!"" and Petunikoff smiled softly.  ""You are a funny fellow!"""
said he. “Look here”--he slapped the old man’s chest jocosely--“your
master and the amateur aristocracy used to have private theatricals

Quick!”
The old butler promptly began to retire backwards upon a handsome
cabinet:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen; surely I have no need to remind you that Mr."
"Pangbutt’s wigs are his private property,” said the shocked, anxious"
old man. “I haven’t Mr. Pangbutt’s permission----”
"Rippley followed him up, grimly smiling:"
"“Get out, you old panjandrum!” said he. “You’ve shown the hiding-place,"
you naughty old deceiver. Go away!”
"He pushed the expostulating old man from the cabinet, and, throwing"
"open the drawers, proceeded to ransack them."
“Hullo!” he cried--“splendid!”
He struck a match:
“Spirit lamp--everything. Ginger! Here’s a glorious short beard affair
that goes down the middle of the chin and all along the throat.”

RUPERT. Prince of the Rhine.
"After an adventurous life as a soldier on the Continent, he sailed from"
Ireland in 1648 with seven ships. His own ship was the _Swallow_. He was a
"man of boundless energy, who was never happy if not engaged in some"

with every kind of adventure.

Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.

"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:

"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""

Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached

"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"

“We are very slenderly endowed.”
John pushed the note across the small table near which they were

The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"But she herself owned this to be as inartistic as it was unintentional,"
"stamping her foot with annoyance at the mischance. Indeed, she"
"apologized most handsomely; for, said she, pathetically, when she had"
got it she did not know what to do with it.
It was an anticlimax.
She threw down the whip and said he might now go home.
He now went home.
There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour’s sister hastened Mr. Myre’s desire to start the great
renaissance of the English drama.
As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and shaved
"off the remains of his drooping moustache by the candle’s light, and"
"soothed the aching bumps that were risen upon his face, he sniffed"
loudly through a swollen nose--he had very tender places--and decided
to go to Rouen until the hair grew.

The duel got upon the town.
"""Yes."""
"""Much?"""
"Kilshaw leant forward and answered, almost in a whisper,"
"""Five hundred on Friday night,"" and in spite of himself he avoided the"
Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"
"about the money, and murdered him to get it. We needn't look further for"
"a motive."""
"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."
"Certainly, if we trust Evans, Gaspard hinted designs on some one before"
he could have known Benyon had this money. Could he have known he was
"going to have it?"""
"""Benyon may have told him I had promised to help him."""
"""Well, sir, we must see about that. We shall want you at the inquest,"
"sir."""
"""I suppose you will, confound you! And I should think you'd want a"
"greater man than I am, too."""
The Superintendent looked grave.
(IN ABSENCE.)
I PASSED your street of many memories.
"A sunset, sombre pink, the flush"
"Of inner rose-leaves idle fingers crush,"
"Died softly, as the rose that dies."
"All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus,"
"Tenderly dying, touched with pain"
A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet
"To stand and watch the roofs, the sky."
"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.
"How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!"
"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!
"Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!"
"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.
"So, sad and glad, your memory visibly"
"Alive within my eyes, I turned;"
"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."

But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a

"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"

ENCOUNTER
By J. Hunter Holly Author of THE GREEN PLANET
"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"
contents ...
"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"
"personality expanding, his brain power increasing, preparing for the"
inevitable encounter that could make him master of the world!

"""Not what you'd call a clue. Did you know the gentleman, sir?"""
Kilshaw replied by saying that Mr. Puttock had introduced Benham to him
and the acquaintance had continued--it was a political acquaintance
purely.
"""You don't know anything about him before he came here?"""
"Kilshaw suddenly perceived that he was being questioned, whereas his"
object had been to question.
"""You say,"" he observed, ""that you haven't got what you'd call a clue."
"What do you mean?"""
"""You can tell Mr. Kilshaw, if you like,"" said the Superintendent to the"
"sergeant, who repeated his information."
"""Gaspard! why that's the fellow the Premier--"" and Mr. Kilshaw stopped"
"short. After a moment, he asked abruptly, ""Were there any papers on the"

"""None, sir."""

"Sarria, grimly."
For the answers of Ramon Garcia were not at all after the pattern set by

CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"
"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""

"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:
"And we, alike from each remote,"
"The world that works, the heaven that waits,"
"Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote,"
The favourite pastime of the Fates.
"We smoke, to fancy that we dream,"
"And drink, a moment’s joy to prove,"
"And fain would love, and only seem"
To love because we cannot love.
"Draw back the blinds, put out the light:"
"’Tis morning, let the daylight come."
"God! how the women’s cheeks are white,"
And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!
EMMY.
"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air,"
"Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,"
"Come to me out of the past, and I see her there"
As I saw her once for a while.
"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright,"
"Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,"
"And still I hear her telling us tales that night,"
Out of Boccaccio’s book.
"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,"
"voice. ""The Swabian dynasty is no more."""
"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.

Indian guides as parting gifts.
"TRYER, MATTHEW."
"A Carolina pirate, accused and acquitted on a charge of having captured a"
"sloop belonging to Samuel Salters, of Bermuda, in 1699."
"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.
"TUCKERMAN, CAPTAIN."
Sailed with Captain Porter in the West Indies. Captain Johnson gives an
account of the meeting between these two pirate novices and the great
Captain Roberts at Hispaniola.
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"
"_The Four P.P._ (? 1540), similarly, requires no more than a palmer, a"
"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"
"Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not to touch the business"
arrangements--you and he would wreck the counting-house in six
months....’
"""No,"" said Etienne, coolly. ""You see, my cousin might not give me"
"another!"""
But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods
as even Rollo himself.
"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the
"chance for worlds, so he replied serenely, ""Do you still intend to shoot"
"us?"""
"""What has that to do with the matter?"" growled Cabrera, who was losing"
his temper.
"""Because if you do,"" said Etienne, who had been waiting his opportunity,"
"""you are welcome to the jewel--_after_ I am dead. But if I am to live, I"
"shall require it for myself!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
THE BURNING OF THE MILL-HOUSE
"Cabrera bit his lip for a moment, frowned still more darkly, and then"
"my being cried out to you--yet all was dark about me, horrible"
"midnight, peopled with foul forms! Oh, that night,--that night--"""
"Shivering, she covered her eyes as if trying to banish the memory."
"""It has passed,"" she breathed after a pause, during which Francesco"
"had taken her in his arms, kissing her eyes, her lips, and the"
"sylph-like, flower-soft face. ""I see the dawn!"""
"""Our dawn!""--Francesco replied, pointing to the hillock beyond."
"For a time there was a great silence, as if the fates of two souls"
were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.
"""How you have suffered!"""
"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.
"""It counts for naught now! Are not you with me?"""
The sky burned azure above the tree-tops. Transient sunshafts quivered
"through the vaulted dome of breathless leaves, as slowly Francesco and"
Ilaria strode towards the camp of the Duke of Spoleto on the
sun-bathed hillock above the Nera.
The End.
"“It has confirmed me in my idea, which I had lost for a few days.”"
“What idea is that?”
"“That we must not defend ourselves in this life, but attack, always"
attack.”
“And now you are contented at having found it again?”
“Yes.”
_PIRANESI’S GARDEN_
"“I am glad, because you have such a pitiable air when you are sad. Would"
"you like to go to the Priory of Malta, which is only a step from here?”"
“Good.”
They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"
"property left, and all that remains are its memories and its archives.”"
“That is how our descendants will see our Holy Mother the Church. In
"Germans, or any other barbarians.”"
"“Yes, this hotel is a hive of petty aristocrats.”"
“Your sister was telling me that you might pick out a very rich wife
"here, among the girls.”"
"“Yes, my sister would like me to live here, in a foreign country, in"
"cowlike tranquillity, looking at pictures and statues, and travelling"
pointlessly. That wouldn’t be living for me; I am not a society man. I
"require excitement, danger.... Though I warn you that I am not in the"
least courageous.”
“You’re not?”
“Not at all. Not now. At moments I believe I could control myself and
take a trench without wavering.”
"“But you have some fixed plan, haven’t you?”"
"“Yes, I expect to go back to Spain, and work there.”"
“At what?”
“In politics.”
“Are you patriotic?”
"“Yes, up to a certain point. I have no transcendental idea of patriotism"
"at all. Patriotism, as I interpret it, is a matter of curiosity. I"
believe that there is strength in Spain. If this strength could be
"led in a given direction, where would it get to? That is my form of"

When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"

"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Leaning across the table, over the beer,"
"While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,"
"As the midnight hour drew near,"
"There with the women, haggard, painted and old,"

"She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told"
Tale after shameless tale.
"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,"
"Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,"
"And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,"
Or ever the tale was done.

"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to
"have shrunken perceptibly as she stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly,"
into space.

IN WHICH A MUTINY IS THREATENED
"Even after they were miles down the Sound, Boyd remained at his post,"
sweeping the waters astern in an anxious search for some swift harbor
"craft, the appearance of which would signal that his escape had been"
discovered.
"""I won't feel safe until we are past Port Townsend,"" he confessed to"
"Cherry, who maintained a position at his side."
"""Why Port Townsend? We don't stop there."""
"""No. But the police can wire on from Seattle to stop us and take me off"

"""If they find out their mistake."""
"""They must have found it out long ago. That's why I've got Peasley"

"speed for her. Once we're through the Straits, I'll be satisfied. But"
"meanwhile--"" Emerson lowered his glasses with a sigh of fatigue, and in"
the soft twilight the girl saw that his face was lined and careworn.

"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""
"""Oh, you think we shouldn't have gone out in a storm like this? I've"
"been dreadfully uneasy!"""
"""No danger at all,"" I declared, with affected indifference, adding: ""The"
"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"

A big and purposeful story interwoven about the responsibilities and
"problems in the medical profession of the present day. Dr. Weaver, a"
"noted specialist, and head of a private hospital, had allowed himself"
_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.

NAVAL PRIZE BILL OF 1911
"_Passed by the House of Commons, but thrown out by the House"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at
the Altemps palace in consequence of the calls he had made. Preciozi
"had been punished and sent away from Rome, and the various Spanish"
monasteries and colleges warned not to receive Cæsar.

CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""
"""One hundred and sixty,"" Slyne told him, and evidently did not think it"
THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.
"ODELL, SAMUEL."
And
"""Far, far from Ypers,"
"I'd like to be,"
Where German snipers
"Can't get at me."""
And
"""When this bloody war is over,"
"O how happy I shall be,"
"When I get my civvy clothes on,"
"No more soldiering for me."""
and all the other songs familiar to every soldier in the British army.
We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.
"""I reckon it's a bloody shame to let the other Tommies and the"
"Frenchies...."""
The voice seemed to die away into a drawl as weariness overcame me. I
"continued to hear the sound of words for a little while, but they"
“Yes.”
“The artist is not living?”
"“For heaven’s sake, man! No.”"
"“Well, if he were alive today they would employ him to make those"
gewgaws some people present to leading ladies and to the deputies of
their district. He would be the king of the manufacturers of ornate
barometers.”
“It is undeniable that Bernini had a baroque taste.”
“He gives the impression of a rather pretentious and affected person.”
"“Yes, he does. He was an exuberant, luxuriant Neapolitan; but when he"
chose he could produce marvels. Haven’t you seen his Saint Teresa?”
“No.”
“Then you must see it. Let’s take a carriage.”
"They drove to the Piazza San Bernardo, a little square containing three"
"churches and a fountain, and went into Santa Maria della Vittoria."
"Kennedy went straight toward the high altar, and stopped to the left of"
it.
"In an altar of the transept is to be seen a group carved in marble,"
representing the ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Cæsar gazed at it absorbed.
"The saint is an attractive young girl, falling backward in a sensual"
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.
some light on it.”
The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by
Winters had arrived.
We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who
"arrived about the same time, and followed Winters."
Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"
"Muller looked dazedly from one of us to the other, but shut up like a"
clam.
"“I think you had better come along with us as a material witness,”"
burst out Winters roughly.
"Kennedy said nothing, leaving that sort of third degree work to the"
"detective. But he was not idle, as Winters tried to extract more than"
"the monosyllables, “I don’t know,” in answer to every inquiry of Muller"
about his employer’s life and business.
The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes
"to a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.
SUBDIVISIONS AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Devonian is represented
in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the
rocks of which they are chiefly composed.
"Gratefully yours,"
Robert Ashburton.
"The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger. “Wot’s de word?”"
"The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous"
"laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.
"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd"
Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears
"All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears"
"In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud."
"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.

Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes
came in sight. Unfortunately their efforts at pursuit were futile.
The Zeppelin developing a turn of speed far in excess of which she
"had been credited by her detractors, had shaken off the British"
"aircraft, and when last seen she was high over the Belgian coast."
"Nevertheless, her wings had been clipped, although she survived to"
tell the tale that the hated English were still able vigorously and
successfully to dispute the mastery of the air.

"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.
"""Hullo, Aubyn, old man!"" exclaimed the latter cordially, as he"
"extended his hand. ""Forgotten me already?"""
"But fortunately for women, Infidels are more numerous than they ever"

The finding of the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of
Admiralty for trying of pirates was as follows:
Acquitted                                 74
Executed                                  52

The rest were accounted for as follows:

"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."

"DEMULCENT.--A mucilaginous or oily, soothing blend to protect irritated"
"skin or mucous membranes, as Carron Oil, White of an Egg, etc."
DEOBSTRUENT.--A medicine which removes functional obstructions in the
"body, as Castor Oil, Magnesium Sulphate, Aloes, etc."
"DEODORANT OR DEODORIZER.--A substance to conceal or destroy foul odors,"
"as Crude Carbolic Acid, Chloride of Lime, etc. Noxious odors may also be"
destroyed and absorbed with freshly burnt charcoal or dry earth.
DEPLETORY.--A medicine which diminishes the quantity of liquid in the
"body, as Iodide or Nitrate of Potassium, etc."
"DEPRESSANT.--A medicine which lessens vital power, as Opium, Aconite,"
etc.
"DEPRESSO-MOTOR.--A medicine that depresses motor activity, as Sodium or"

"The watch forward called in a guarded voice: ""All right, sir?"" to which"
"I answered, ""All right,"" then went cautiously across deck and crept down"
"the companionway stairs. The cabin was dark so I felt for my stateroom,"
passed in and closed the door. Somehow my fingers could not locate the
"light jet, but what matter? In three minutes I had undressed and was"
fast asleep.
CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOK
"THE proper layout for an ordinary volume, arranged in accord with the"
"best usage, is as follows:"
then the stronger water of ammonia.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 to 20 m. Should be diluted one drachm to half pint of water."
SPIRITUS AMMONIAE--SPIRIT OF AMMONIA
"An alcoholic solution containing ten per cent., by weight of the ammonia"
gas.
DERIVATION.--A solution of caustic ammonia in alcohol.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless liquid, having a strong odor of ammonia. This"
preparation of ammonia possesses properties of ammonia and alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 to 20 m. Should be diluted in water."
SPIRITUS AMMONIAE AROMATICUS--AROMATIC SPIRIT OF AMMONIA
"DERIVATION.--Ammonium carbonate 3.4%, aqua ammonia 9%, oil of lemon 1%,"
"oil of lavender flowers 0.1%, oil of nutmeg 0.1%, alcohol 70%, and"
distilled water to make 100 parts. Diluted in water.
"PROPERTIES.--A nearly colorless liquid when first prepared, but"
gradually acquires an amber color. It has a pungent ammoniacal odor and
taste.
ACTIONS.--These four proportions of ammonia are gastric and general
stimulants. They stimulate the cardiac respiratory and spinal systems.
"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”

Even in those three words her accent was unmistakably cockney--as
"unmistakably cockney as the coarse-featured, snub-nosed, common little"
"face. In happier, freer conditions she would have done her skimpy hair"
"up in patent curlers and worn a hat with a purple feather, and joined"
heartily in the raucous merriment of her comrades at the pickle-factory.
"Here, however, she was lying, poor little devil, thought Risca, warped"
"from childhood by the ascetic ideal, and wrecked body and spirit by"
unutterable cruelty. In her eyes flickered the patient apprehension of
the ill-treated dog.
"“I hope you will soon get better,” he said, with sickening knowledge of"
that which lay hidden beneath the rough bedclothes.
"“Yes, sir,” said Unity."
"“It 's chiefly her nerves now,” said the matron. “She hollers out of"
"nights, so she can't be put into the dormitory.”"
“Do you like the things I send you?” asked John.
"“Yes, sir.”"
“Is there anything special you'd like to have?”
"“No, sir.”"
But he caught a certain wistfulness in her glance.

CHAPTER XV
THE JOURNEY HOME--THE FISHING AND WORKING OF THE KALOMA SHELL
I
The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by following exactly
the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu. In each inhabited
"island, in every village, where a halt had previously been made,"
"they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of Sanaroa,"
"in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited. Some"
"Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the talo'i"

about the reception which the uvalaku party have received in Dobu;
"the yield in valuables is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between"
the present occasion and previous records.
"No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there"

"When Noll had left his baggage in a quiet hotel by the Strand, and"

firm.

homewards Noll did not take his steps; he felt a certain sense of shame

I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.

"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."

I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.

You crazy?
I...
I'm just a little kid.

The kids wake you up?
No.
I just couldn't sleep.
You want to talk?
No.
"It's all right, Joe."

"Oh, but..."
"I'll come by your house if I can, maybe."
It's okay.
"See you tomorrow, Gracie."
Then there was the other mom.
Mommy?
"How was school, baby?"

What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
You want the neighbors to see me?

He's dead!
Schwartz is dead.

I was...
Get ahold of yourself.
It's okay.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
That's when I got burned.
It's four months ago now.
I left four years ago.

I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.

"Oh, babe."
What were you doing here anyway?
She's breathing.
Go get help.

"He acted like he found gold, for God's sakes."
"- He'll be okay, Mom."
- I know.
I should pack.
- Is that John?

"It's work, but guess what."
He asked me to marry him.
Really?
"Well, he didn't really mean it."
"I mean, it was"
When the times comes....

Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.

I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.

Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?

"Um, no not really."
Seriously?

"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.

"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.

Pull up to him.
"Come on, fellas, easy."
My leg!
Something's wrong with my leg.

"He's been shot, Tommy."
The killer got away.
Daddy!

Ready?
Get the ball!
"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
"Don't worry, my doll."
Don't cry.
Forget about it.
"No, grandma."
I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.
- We have a winner.
- Two reais.
- It's cheaper in the circus.
- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Wait.
This guy's Ollie?
They fucking talk about Ollie all the time.
I thought they made him up.
What?
"It's always like, ""we went to the zoo with Ollie."
"We built a fort with Ollie."""
"""Yeah, okay."""
Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
Thanks for the beverage!
Man on PA:
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Oh, shoot."
I'm in it now.
We've been open six months and had not one customer.
"You don't think it's -- it ain't my dancing, is it?"
"Yes, it is your dancing."
Show me your shapes.
"Oh, I got a ton."
"Here, check this out."
Hot Dog.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Hot Dog.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Those are not enough shapes!
No one will wash their car here because of you!
I got more shapes.
"I mean, come on."
I know all sorts of shapes.
I better go home and practice me some shapes.
"Yes, you will!"
You better go!
You better go!
"Okay, here we go."
Here comes a chair.
Close enough.
What are you doing Meatwad?
Come here.
Get out of there.
- Move.
"- What's happening, baby?"
"- Where you been, huh?"
- I've been in there.
- Can you stand a toss?
- Sure.
I'm clean.
- You use shit?
"- No, man."
"Oh, man, who are you, Dick Tracy or somebody?"
I said I was clean.
"- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?"
- No.
I said I'm clean.
"- If I do, you know what happens, don't you?"
- Yeah.
I said I'm clean.
"Aw, motherfucker, don't-"
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass.
Fuck you.
- [Indistinct]
"- Oh, yeah, in where?"
- Gimme a nickel.
"- Come on, man."
Gimme a nickel.
Come on.
Come on!
I told you I'm clean.
Why the fuck you wanna come down on me like that for?
- Get your ass in there.
-He's fine.
Look.
Here's your ball!
Get your ball!
Get your ball!
Get..
Of course.
You don't want a tennis ball.
Not when you can have a meatball.
"Come on, get the meatball."
"God, what have I done to you?"
"I broke the dog, Pheebs!"
I broke the dog!
Thanks.
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?
"Oh, I got big Valentine's plans."
"I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy."
"Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.."
We actually watched the documentary together.
"Oh, my Chinese food."
I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are..?
Hi!
How are you?
I'm supposed to pick you up.
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!
-Oh!
"Hey, Mona!"
"-Hi, Rachel."

Search for the hero relic we just found again?
What a pain!
No thanks.
"Why is it that everywhere we go, things always become a giant pain?"
"Yeesh, this really sucks."
"""The legend continues..."""
Open it or he dies.
Open it.
- Open it.
Get out here.
Get out here.
Tell him to come out here.
- Tell him.
"- Do what he says, Dennis."
- Thanks.
- Unh.
"Unh, please, don't do this."
"- No, thank you."
- How 'bout some organic fuel?
- That freak juice?
- Pass.
Whoo!
Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
"Nah, not me, Flo."
I'm on one of them there special diets.
I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics.
"""You race like you fix roads. """
I'll show him.
I will show him!
"Oh, great!"
I hate it!
"- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!"
- Music.
Sweet music.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
"Radiator Springs, a happy place!"
"OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?"
Great!
I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!
Wow.
"Mornin', Sally!"
"Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!"
Yes!
"Uh, amazing!"
Whoa-ho!
Yeah!
"Oh, Ramone!"
"She's scared, but she's all right."
"Listen, Nina--"
"End the damn call, Lisa."
Hang up now.
"( gunshot, people scream )"
"Oh, my God."
( Charlie gasping )
( group gasps )
Help me sit him up.
DR PENZLER:
It's all right.
Come on.
- There you go.
"- Oh, my God."
CHARLIE:
Cellophane.
- What?
- Cellophane.
Cellophane.
Somebody find some cellophane somewhere.
"All right, he's got it."
Get it off.
I've got a scarf!
I've got a scarf!
Where are you going?
"I'm getting my scarf because you shot him, Ray!"
"Ray, Charlie is really hurt."
We've gotta get him to a hospital.
"I guess I wasn't that much help to you after all, was I?"
"This doesn't have to get any worse, Ray."
"Everything gets worse, Dr Penzler."
Every stinking thing in this world.
- Oh!
"- Okay, all right."
"Time to go, time to go."
- Okay.
Horace:
Let's go.
"- Okay, I'm going."
- Let's go.
"- Hey, wait, wait, wait."
Where's my twenty?
- Look under Pete's watch.
- Holy shit.
- All right.
That's enough.
- Fucking scumbag!
What the-- Horace:
That's enough of your shit.
"Let's go, goodbye."
"- What the fuck was that, huh?"
- Yeah.
Mary Ann: (quietly) Iâm just gonna go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm-
"- See my sister, I told you."
- Why are you going there?
- Iâm just gonna go to my sister's house.
I can go where I want.
"- No, you're not."
"- I don't need your permission, Horace."
"- No, you're not."
- You have no right to keep me here like a fucking prisoner.
"Just let me go, please."
- Talkative.
- Mm-hmm.
- Rambling.
Is that a problem?
People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.
Helps compensate for the fear.
"- Masks it, too."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.
The voices make you feel less alone.
Even though you are alone.
"You aren't scaring me, Katie."
Pity.
Is there like a refrigerator here?
There's some snacks in the cupboard.
Alrighty.
"Eenie meenie, miney..."
Mo!
Alright.
"Okay, ginger snaps."
Let's see.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
This'll do.
Now... um...
"He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?"
"Yeah, that's how this works."
Knew it.
Jump scares get pretty old...
Fuck!
"Oh, God."
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?
- Is my brother going to die?
"- No, he is not!"
"No, he is not!"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.
I need to clear an airway.
- You got a pen?
- What?
A pen?
Do you have a pen on you?
Here we go.
Come on!
All right.
Come on.
"Breathe, damn it!"
"All right, here we go."
Come here.
Help me out.
"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.
I got him.
- What do you got?
- A 12-year-old trapped in a culvert.
Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."
-Nice.
-There you go.
Is it nice?
.
Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!
-Buy load instead!
Thank you Migs!
-Joy!
Stay here first.
-What happened?
-We'll take care of that.
"-Migs, wake up!"
It's too low.
-Why did you come inside?
-Alex please!
What is that?
I hear balloons.
"I'm actually, uh..."
I'm doing birthday parties now.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
"- Well, that's good."
"- Yeah, yeah, it is good."
"So, okay, uh, take Meemaw to the doctor, got it, and I'll do a good job of that."
"I won't let you down, okay?"
I promise.
"- Thank you, Chip."
"- Thank you, Mom."
"Where are you, by the way?"
- I gotta go.
- You outta town?
Mom?
- You doin' okay?
- Hi.
"- Hey, Mom, what's goin 'on?"
"How are you, Cody?"
All is well.
"How are you, Mom?"
- Where's Logan?
"- Uh, he's sleeping."
"Oh, God, he always was a sleeper."
"- Man, you know that."
"- You have a lot of energy, more than him."
[Chuckling]
"Um, I have a little surprise."
Please share.
"What is it, what is it?"
- Yes Sir!
Got a big shadow though!
She's the biggest woman in Japan.
Here's name's Amelian.
- Amelian!
- Yes Sir!
Beat him up!
Don't pull me!
Stay away from me...
I've got B.O.!
I'm getting dizzy.
Please let me go!
Let me down!
What a B.O.!
You still want Amelian?
No...!
I wouldn't dare...!
Give me the money!
"Some more, don't you try to fool me!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
I won't tell you.
Amelian has been again!
I can't hear your death bells ringing!
"You wouldn't tell the lady, I'll get you a man!"
Hiroshima!
Why is it taking so long?
Have you got it yet?
In a second!
Soon!
It is hot!
It's time!
"Let me do the introductions,"
No!
"Uh, maybe..."
"uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...!"
Mm.
I like this one.
Ugh!
"You think you do, but you don't."
What do I think of this wine?
Great question.
Here's what you think.
"Hey, Ethan."
How's Rudy?
How's Beanbag?
"Uh, they're great."
Beanbag's great.
Rudy's such a delight.
I just dropped off some juice for them.
Can I get a cranberry juice?
Uh-oh...
Coming right up.
"Um, who's Rudy?"
- He's my son.
- You have a son?
"Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability."
"So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"So, your face is saying one thing..."
No.
No.
I love kids.
Okay.
That's so not you.
Why'd you do it?
Because you didn't say goodbye.
"Goodbye, Rory."
"Bye, Jess."
- Great.
I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.
- You thought ahead.
Smart.
The mirror.
Yeah.
I never leave home without all the essentials:
"Mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy."
- I'm done.
Do you want to use it?
- Thanks.
- Don't I look charming?
- You look great.
I looked better.
I had to run here straight from work.
Kinko's.
"Hey, Liza."
That gets me thinking.
Maybe you and I ought to do a little reproducing after the ceremony.
- Clever.
- Don't be a snot.
Shut up.
"- That's my boyfriend, Zach."
- Sure.
We're breaking up'cause we're transferring to different schools.
He's going to Florida State.
I'm going to UMass.
I just have no idea what element goes there.
"Okay, Michelangelo, but we have to close our eyes to match the photo."
So you're the timekeeper.
Well- (SCOFFS)
"Yeah, dude, it's 7:59."
Just go ahead.
"Well, how long do we do it for?"
"10, 15 seconds?"
I'll tell you when to stop.
Just go.
(EXHALES)
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.
Sweet.
Threesome.
"(SCOFFS) Come here, asshole."
(GASPS) Oh!
Of course.
"Oh, geez, did you guys-"
Hey!
(GASPS)
(DOOR SLAMS) Shit.
- Finn.
- Go get Jasper.
I just wanted to- Go get Jasper!
"- Finn, I'm sorry."
- Who is this?
That's my bookie.
Ivan.
The guy you're always talking on the phone to?
What is he doing in the apartment?
- I don't know.
- Is that normal?
Unique.
This is one view that's been shown over a thousand times.
But each time the effect is amazing.
- Hi Ankita.
- Shiv.
You joined the police force?
Yes.
And now I'm here to join you for your security.
But when did you become Zoravar?
I'll tell you.
Let's go.
Okay.
I get it.
- Hey Ankita.
- Hey how are you?
Good.
- Shiv Dimple.
- Hi Dimple.
Hi.
You two go on I'll park my bike.
Ankita.
Hello.
Vishal I've already fixed my program with my friend.
Even our wedding's been fixed Ankita.
My dad and you rbrother fixed it.
And pop...
Oh!
And you know who... my pop is.
Home Minister Pradhan.
And do you know why you're given police protection.
Because I said so.
Me.
-The cop?
What cop?
-Get on the phone!
We're gonna die for this!
"Hello, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
"Come on, Nick."
"Come on, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
We'll know for sure after we see the tests.
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.
"Can I have the book, please?"
Thanks.
"All he knows, it went dark."
"If he'd have turned around, Frank, they'd have hanged us for it."
"And something, something put that cop there."
"It's an act of God, those lights went out."
Don't look back.
-What?
-Don't look back.
It's a cop.
-His red light's on.
"-Oh, God."
"No, no, leave 'em on."
Bathroom upstairs?
"Ah, yeah."
What's the ladder doin' there?
I don't know.
"Hey, come here."
All right.
Sure.
I hope it's a girl.
Relax!
Calm down!
Calm down!
"Stop screaming, you'll waste your strength."
"Push, come on!"
"My god, it's a boy!"
Look how pretty he is.
It's a boy!
"Here it is, the macarroni."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Look.
Febo!
Febo!
Febo!
"I have to admit, I've never been there."
You knew I'd be here.
Are we even?
- Come with me to Capri.
- No.
I believe in my marriage.
Though...
"Febo, Palm..."
Did you find the dogs?
Not yet.
It's my fault.
"- You're a good person, Captain."
"- No more than you are, Mrs. Wyatt."
"What's this about ""net weight in the morning""?"
What does it mean?
"I insisted on that, sir."
Scientifically... the morning is when the human body weighs the least.
This is ESPN Classic.
They play all old games.
So the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
"1986, the finals, game seven."
You remember watching this?
You were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
I remember.
I was so swollen.
I hated Detroit.
"- Isiah, Laimbeer."
- Yeah.
Dumars.
"Oh, my..."
"But Worthy, James Worthy, he saved us."
He shot the lights out.
So fantastic.
You know that thing I was trying to talk to you about?
- Jimmy.
"- No, I'm just saying that I took care of it."
- I knew you would.
- You did?
I can't believe I'm old enough to have watched people play in those shorts.
"Hey, Marissa."
Marissa?
I'll go.
Here you go.
Hey.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Come on.
You can tell me.
- He's okay with this one.
You have a case.
- Druse.
Again?
- Mama.
"- Hush up, Bobby."
This could be serious.
I've got pins and needles all up my right arm.
There.
Isn't it lovely?
Ready?
"And one, two, three, up."
"Sweatpants, no pockets."
We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.
I know who he is.
- You want me to guess?
Is there a prize?
- I can't get air in him.
- I know.
- Really?
Want to share?
His name's Peter Rickman.
He lives in Castleview.
He's a famous artist.
"Liz, could I get an 18-gauge needle, please?"
"No syringe, just the needle."
- Are you...
- Yes.
"Tension pneumo, Elmer."
Pleural sac is inflating like a beach ball.
Time for a party trick.
May I be excused?
"Working title ""Old Maids of Margate"""
It's Southend.
"Twenty one, Lily sweet Rose spunky."
Rose gets the boyfriend.
"My darling, I couldn't die without saying,"
"""The cornflower blow in your eyes the final time."" You can have that on me."
What's his name?
The boyfriend.
Eric.
Eric Lum.
Do you hear that noise?
That's 200 women in 1 in 9 never allowed to call their sons anything as bloody feeble as Eric.
Give me hero's name?
Jon.
Dull.
Johnnie.
Hm..hmm.
They left him to make it back.
Injured.
Oh!
This.
A rescue!
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there!
Hear!
Saved a smiling Officer.
Hm.
Fellow soldier...saves the dog.
But he didn't!
"In real life, he didn't."
Films!
Mrs.Cole.
"And now, the situation in portugal -"
"Nice, huh?"
"What,s wrong?"
"- I,m afraid."
Why?
What is it?
"I don,t know."
"Sweetie pie, what,s wrong?"
Are you okay?
This is science.
"It,s not -"
"I don,t know."
That woman -
Have you seen my pills?
"Aren,t they on the table?"
"You know, I really feel awful."
What are they doing?
"CIaudine,s feeling down."
"She,s crying."
Jean-MicheI is comforting her.
"They,re such a pain!"
",I,m always the one who brings up breakfast.,"
Time for our little show.
"It,s ready, ma,am."
"3, 2, 1 ."
Be happy.
Love one another.
"We,re creating this city for you."
To make you happy.
"Be happy, but not too happy."
"Too happy and you,d have nothing to wish for."
"- What,s this crap?"
Let me just finish.
My skin is way lighter than yours.
Okay.
Just wait.
You'll see.
I just have to do your whole face first.
-What are
- Where are you going?
- I don't have to come in till 2:00.
"- Oh, see you at 2:00 then."
- Okay.
Seeya.
Guy at 1:00.
Not cute.
Say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- That doesn't match your skin color.
- I know.
It doesn't.
"Do you want me to finish, or do you want me to leave it how it is?"
Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.
I'm 18.
She's 17.
- I turn 18 next week.
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."
- Thank you.
- Want me to get you a cab?
"- No, I'm fine."
- All right.
"Ooh, good."
Sir!
Sorry.
Hello!
Are you sure about this?
You're going to take me?
"- Get in, lady."
- Thanks.
"Here's where I'm going, but don't go until I put up the window."
"- They're broke, lady."
- My hair!
Don't complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.
Oh!
- Hi.
- Hi!
Hi.
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
You're exactly on time.
My hair.
"Well, what do you think?"
Yeah...
Go ahead...
She's all yours.
Whas wrong?
No good?
I can't get it up.
Angelras!
I have to get off now.
He doesn't know what he's in for!
We sure warmed her up!
What about me?
Why can't I get it up?
The bastard!
I sure hope he gets his...
"Right on a nice, sharp curve..."
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts!
Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.
"Track 4, train number 1411..."
For Bridolle.
All aboard...
"Close the doors, please."
Go ahead.
Shorty?
- Yeah!
- Shorty!
"- Hello, boss!"
"- Why, you old son of a gun."
You came just in time.
You saved my life.
"Well, look at you."
You're all dressed up.
Yeah.
We're in the money.
I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all.
I went right in and signed the names.
"- Oh, and the claim was-"
- Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.

"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.
What is it?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
"Of course, now, they refuse to go to bed on time..."
We would expect you to cook all the meals.
"Wash up, laundry-"
- That's in addition to the baby...

"Well, thank you--"
"Mrs. Field,"
"I promise, I'm not a flake."
I'm very good at sleep-training and I'm an excellent cook.
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.

I can't.

You're gonna have to come talk to me sooner or later.
Go away!
I can't!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
"I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home."
"This is our home, Jenna, and I'm..."
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
But I'm moving into Kenny's.
I'm still gonna be his dad.
Okay.
Good.

Hi.
Sorry?

He said he was goin' into town to get some parts.
Smells good in here today.
Is that door locked?
"Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again."
"Oh, I'll never be doing that"
- again.
"But I did it, didn't I?"
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!
- You did.
Are you up?
"No, I'm here."
Can I come over?
What can I say?
- Thank you.
You saved me.
- So your apartment's ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
They did a great job.
It's better than it was before.
I should've burned it down long ago.
- Ok.
Ok.
- Ok.
"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.
- I lost the apartment.
- I know.
I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
Out of what?
"- Your words don,t match your lips."
- Neither do yours.
"What,s going on?"

Go on.
Just like that?

"No, you are."
Is that all you can think of?
"No, I couId say..."
"I,ve had enough."
You go out.
"You see people and have fun, while I,m stuck here alone."
Then you come home and get waited on.
Are you kidding now?
"Sure, I laugh all day long."
"And you cry too, right?"
What would you know?
Where's our mom?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.
Lukas will be alive.
"I'll make you both breakfast, put out your clothes."
"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.
Elias...
It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?
She's lying.
Let her prove she's our mom.
What am I doing?
What's Lukas doing?
But I can't see him!
What's he doing?
Elias...
Mom would know that.
Mom could see him.
She'd know what he's doing.
"No, Elias."
Don't!

What?
So the whole country's off-limits?

"Well, who's this girl?"
It's a long story.
"If we ever make it out of the U.S. alive,"
I'll tell it to you.
All kinds of craziness.
Good crazy?

Is that Mike?
"No, it's Schmidt."
"Hey, Schmidt."
What's up?
You have to help me!
They're coming!
Okay...
"Schmidt, hang on."
What -- what's the problem?
Is somebody at the motel?
"No, I'm not at the motel, okay?"
"I mean, I was at the motel."
Then I went back to my warehouse --
Wait a minute.
What -- y-you went to the warehouse?
Why?
-What's your point?
-I don't know.
"We went there for a month, a million years ago."
-Why you so jazzed to go back?
-I just think it's worth looking into.
"All right, what's our cover?"
"FBI, Homeland Security?"
-Swedish exchange students?
SAM:
Don't worry.
I got an idea.
Okay.

DEAN:
"Thanks, Dad."
Got your lunch?
-Books?
Butterfly knife?
"-Yeah, Dean."
-You okay?
-Sure.
Sammy?
"I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to and it's only November."
-I'm just sick of being the new kid.
DEAN:
You'll be fine.
"If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know."
[SCOFFS]
"Relax, Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops."
"As soon as he gets back, we're out of here."
To another school.
Awesome.
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
"Jimmy, he's gonna pay you."
I'll fucking kill you!
"Give me the money, cocksucker."
Pay me!
"He'll pay, he'll pay."
Morrie's.
Who's this?
He's here.
"Jimmy, I'm sorry."
You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you....
"You've got it, kid."
"You've got it, believe me."
"Karen, slow down."

Stay there.
Don't move.
"It's Karen, Jimmy."
What happened?
What happened?

- Wait--
"Come on, come on, out this way."

"You killed him, huh?"
Get the essentials out of there.
"Come on, get those guys out of here."
Get them out of here.
"Now, I'm going to Peakstown to get Dr. Loring to sign the death certificate."
You phone him and tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Hello.

"You're a lucky man, Commander."
A fortune just came knocking on our door.
"I was in the blouse, too!"
"She was there, too."
I see.
That's all right.

"I'll tell you, if I'm hurt."
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?

"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.

Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.

I put my trust in you because I knew
You would take care of us.
But now my baby's out there.

It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"

But she's not married.
I know that.
Who did the damage?
We don't know.
She won't tell us.
"You'd want to find out, wouldn't you?"
"Excuse me, compadre."
What's it to you who it was?
I couldn't give a shite who it was.
"I'm not gonna buy the food, the nappies... or the little bleedin' track suits."
Dessie is!

Hang on a sec.
"Maybe I will, what?"

"Hey, Bob?"
What are you doing for lunch?
"I'm doing it, Jerry."
Where are you going?

I don't think you want to know.
Go ahead Jerry.
It won't bother me.

Somebody in here?
This is so wasted.
"Bobby, isn't it a beautiful morning?"
You promised you'd stop.
"Never again, you said."
This is where I work.
"Yes, but this time, I think I really am ill."
"Still now, Mrs. Druse."
Still as a mouse.
But please pay no mind to it.
Please give me the knife.
--Here you go...
--Thanks.
Hold here.
--Well hold it!

--In his room.
"--No, no, this room is mine --Where do I go?"
"Right this way, please"
--Thanks --Sure
"Sasha, see, Pavel Ivanovich arrived in person."
That hook

--A chandelier
--What kind?
"--Crystal, with attachments"
--It was sold during the war.
--Please hand me a pen and paper
--Got any other kind of paper?

Only the graph paper.
--Aleksandr Ivanovich Ermakov --Move away please
Alright
"See, Sasha."
"He'll sign the permission, I'll go get Nastya, and all will be well."
You already brought one here.
That's quite enough.
Shame on you.
What are you doing?
She'll pick you up later.
Don't go!
Maria!
Where are you?
"Hold on, Quico."
Come back already!
Now you can blow out the candles.
Should I make a wish first?
"Sure, my darling."
Help!
Get me away from here!
Well done.
Let's eat the cake now.
Doesn't your doll get a piece?
She doesn't know how to eat.
You never talk to me.
- Talk about what?
- Anything.
"I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me."
Tell me what's on your mind.
- When?
- Now.
Where is my mom?
Where is my dad?
What?
Where are my mom and dad?
- Time for your presents!
"- Tell me, grandma."
"What, darling?"
Where are my mom and dad?
I told you already.
They left you with me.
What else?
-Scotch.
-Nice.
-Red wine.
-Okay.
-Now we can eat.
"-Some white, too."
Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
"You got to go on a diet, Vinnie."
Read 'em and weep.
What are you doing?
"Alright, I'll catch you guys later."
"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.
-ls there any more?
"-Nope, that's it."
Have a good weekend.
Thanks Henry.
You girls stay right here.
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.
What are you talking about?
I saw her name on the register.
Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
1986.
The finals.
Game Seven.
You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.
She is really talented.
Turn this off!
"Hey, turn it off!"
I cannot believe you!
That's the girl that
I am dating!
How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?
!
"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.
"Your photos, your movies, your website... it's all blocked."
Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.
Ben?
What are you doing here?
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.
Open the door.
Wrong door.
"Wrong door, Connor."
C'mon.
I'm trying.
Hurry.
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
Look behind you!
"The giant, it's attacking!"
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
- Sweet mother of God.
- MANSLEY:
"Look, damn you!"
(ENGINE ROARING)
I am not a gun.
"Hey, Mom."
(ROARS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Let's get out of here!
Run!
(GASPS)
Hey.
Stop!
There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."
Go to code red.
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
"- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends."
- Mm.
"All right, roast beef, turkey."
What do you want?
"Oh, let's do the works."
Pile it high.
"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.
You were there?
Yep.
"You know, before I touched down here, I moved around a lot."
"New Orleans, New York, Chicago."
Been here the longest.
Ah!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Ahh.
Yo?
I'm stripes.
That's right.
What?
You're kidding me.
"No, no, I can't switch shifts with you."
I've been drinking.
"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!
Bleah!
Oh!
Wow.
What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."
My sister?
Danielle.
"You mentioned her earlier, no?"
- No.
- Oh.
"It must have been Simon, then."
He talks about you a lot.
Thanks for the dance.
Anytime.

I'm warning you.
Let this go.
I have it under control.
There you are.
Sorry.
I-I think I had too many mojitos.
I just... needed to lie down.
"Well, I hope tonight wasn't a complete waste."
Did you at least manage to have some fun?
"- I mean, Blanca's great."
- Mm.
"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.
She's right.
I've never met a woman like you... ever.
And I don't think I ever will again.
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Painted Face is back!
I'm scared!
- Get rid of him!
- OK.
"Foon, it was a good idea to come back!"
She's back in my arms again.
"Old pal, let's impress her one more time."
Watch this!
- Are you OK?
"- Yeah, I just tripped."
"Foon, you're overacting."
Painted Face!
We're in trouble!
This is a different guy!
Help!
Help!
- I'm here!
- Let's go!
Come on!
- Faster!
- I'm spilling my wine!
"- Sifu Wong, are you abandoning me?"
- Aren't I holding you tight?
You've been holding my hand the whole night!
Are you crazy?
I'm going crazy!
I've been possessed by a demon!
Exorcism is my forte.
Where's the ghost?
Where's the ghost?
"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
Where's your scary boyfriend?
Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.
Mind if I join you?
I love heights.
"From up here, it all just seems so much smaller, you know?"
"I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes I think I see lights out beyond the wall."
"I know they say it's all just wasteland out there, but..."

See?
It's okay.
It's just the thing that made everybody go to sleep.
"Okay, I need you to do me a favor."
.
When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."
-My wife is so beautiful.
-You're really such a joker.
-But it's not that.
-Here you go again.
-Oh come on!
-Really!
So Joy...
Where are we?
"So, does it mean you're the only one who has surprises for me?"

Is that okay?
Is that okay?

Is that okay?
-It's beautiful!
-I told you!
But it's not yours to keep.
Great!
Really great.
And so began our summer with Tetra.
"He lived in my closet like an old friend, ...who'd been there for years."
"Hello, Misaki!"
Hello.
Is Yusuki home?
He's been in his room all morning ...just go on in.
Anybody home?
Whassup...
"How is he, Yusuki?"
I'm so sorry!
You gave me a fright.
Didn't you hear me?
Sorry.
"But boy, you scared me!"
My heart's thumping.
Stuff for Tetra.
Thanks.
Here's the aluminum.
How about this?
Let's ask Tetra!
Choose what you need.
He's so cute!
He likes that.
What's he making?
Dunno.
"But there's lots of parts, ...and he's real quick."
We interrupting?
Don't just barge in.
Your Mom said it was okay.
Reason why should be showing her
Off in public anytime soon.
"OK, bye bye."
Sir.
Sir!
Yes?
You have to pay.
"No, no."
It's OK.
I'm a fireman.
With 62 truck.
We already don't get paid enough
As it is.
And God forbid this store catch
"On fire, I would be the one to"
Run in here and save all of you.
"So, I mean, I think"
The least that you can do is
"Offer me some free food, you"
"Know, as reward."
"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."
"Hey, what's up, man?"
This your car?
"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
Sorry?
The car.
"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?
Copper.
- And what about me?
- And what about me?
- And what about me?
"- And me as well, and me as well..."
The taxi's coming in 15 minutes.
Where's Ricky?
- He's meeting us in Marseille.
- Why?
He wanted to leave before us.
"Okay, Marseille."
"Second-biggest city in France, on the coast of the Mediterranean."
Population:
"About a million and a half, among them 80,000 Jews."
Not bad.
"- And about 300,000 Arabs."
- We're going to Gaza...
"- Hey, Zinedine Zidane grew up in Marseille."
- Who's that?
What's that?
"""L decided to stay."
Waiting for you at Rosa's till you calm down.

Him and his manipulations.
What a pest.
There's Ricky.
- Beirut is gone.
- What?
"- Beirut, the restaurant?"
- Yeah?
New owners.
"It's called ""Yizar"""
- and it's a karaoke club.
.
I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?
.
-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
- He's in the next room.
- So the chocolate was for him?
- Mel...
- It was a retropharyngeal hematoma.
- What?
I snuck a look at his CT results.
- So he wasn't choked.
- No.
It happened earlier.
Probably from the fall.
I need to go.
My place after shift?
Sure.
Why not?
- I was getting worried.
- I can't do this.
- What?
"Tash, stop..."
"- Griff, just stop."
That's my sponsor.
I texted her.
"- What, you're in the program all of a sudden?"
"- Yeah, I am."
Come on!
I was sober for 8 months
- before you showed up at my door tonight.
"- Tash, listen."
"We can work out the whole stripping thing,"
"I was being an idiot, OK?"
Don't leave!
"If you leave, I'll have nothing."
We have a future.
- Chase.
- Yeah?
I need to talk to you about the baby.
Why don´t you take a few minutes and then meet me in my office?
Mr Milliken?
Mr Milliken?
"Oh, my God."
Mrs Milliken!
Come quickly!
Quickly!
Hey.
How´s the hand?
It´s fine.
How´d Chappelle find out?
I don´t know. lt doesn´t really matter.
What´s going on?
Almeida´ll interrogate Nina.
I´ll follow it from a feed.
Good.
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
"- Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
- Sure.
Thank you.
"Jack, you´re about to find something out about me that´s not gonna make you happy."
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me.
Do you mind?
I´ve got a daughter.
- A daughter?
- Her mother dropped her off and she split.
- lt´s a long story.
Shit.
"You think you're tough, bitch?"
Keep the ground floor clear.
Package is on the move.
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
We are coming in hot.
"Copy that, sir."
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
"GO, go!"
Mr. President.
Glasses.
Match.
We're in.
Go!
Go ahead.
I'll button this up.
Go ahead.
"Mr. Vice President, I apologise in advance but this is gonna be the hardest takeoff you've ever felt."
"We're gonna put this bird at 30,000 feet in 45 seconds."
James William Sawyer.
Gentlemen.
What are you doing?
!
"Please, Martin, what are you doing?"
"I'm sorry, Ted."
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.
Emily?
"Where are you at, baby?"
Please tell me you got out of here.
Mr. Stenz.
We're in.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.
(SCATTING)
I'll be right back.
Crazy.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Siri?
"The number you called, not ..."
You see?
Whether they find?
-We Need to confess.
"-No Need, no!"
My father would kill me.
-what Are you doing?
-help Me.
Play more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-was Zana.
She was alone in the E6 after the killing.
-Five Miles away?
There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.
Kaan?
Take Sinan and get out.
Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this.
What was it?
I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
"Try a little harder, Candan."
Hello?
Candan just left.
Okay.
Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay?
Did you get it?
"Yeah, you wish."
We are screwed.
It's a different bag.
"What do you mean ""a different bag""?"
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her bag?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished.
They're leaving.
How are things with you?
It's not good at all.
Try and delay her.
I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her?
Nicely done.
That's a good look.
"Don't laugh at me, Drew."
Come on.
What happened to your eye anyway?
My eye's fine.
Just let me...
"Let me have your shirt, please."
What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.
I can't go in to Gates like this.
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...
All right.
All right.
Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.
Stop being like that.
"Hey, everybody, I made it."
Just kidding.
"Big day, huh?"
Everybody pretty excited about it?
"Hey, Allan made it."
Whoa.
"What happened with your eye, bud?"
"Nothing, man."
I'm okay.
Yeah?
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
"All right, see you then."
"How soon can you get me Operator 19, St. Louis?"
That's my girl.
"Hi, Al."
This is Rip.
"Sure, I'm great."
Did you get my phone message this morning?
Not yet.
Not f or a while.
I got unfinished business down here first.
Somebody who used to be your Detroit competition.
Calls himself Martinelli.
"Yeah, in spades."
Did you dig me up the name of a good man down here?

"Oh, he's gonna kill me when he sees this, man."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, we'll shoot."
We'll shoot it.

"Dad wait, how many years have you been with mommy?"
Is it 29?
"Ara, is it 29?"

"- Oh, I'll have Merlot too."
Would you see if there's any bubble water in the fridge?
Yes.
"For you, a thousand times, yes."
Thank you.

I've been waiting for this job.
I don't want it to go to someone else.
Do you want me to beg?
"Je, please just this one time."
Tomorrow I will send the rest.

That lipstick on the windshield thing took us a long time.
I know.
I know it.
Yeah.

- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
-I saw our future.
What?
-He came to me.
-Seriously.
"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.
But he lacked fly.

-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.

You can do this.
Let's go.

"Vivian, how long have you been down here?"
Weeks.
"Once, I don't know."
This is your chance to get out.
We have to go.
I cant.
Fuck it.
Leave her.
You can't leave her.
Beautiful land you got out here.
Thank you kindly.
I guess it was just kids playing around with the phone.
Take care.
"Sorry you had to drive all this way, Sheriff."
Don't go!
"Wait, wait!"
"Granddad, what are you doing?"

COUNTDOWN MUSIC BEGINS Is that one word or two?
One word or two?
Two words.
You blew it.
Has anyone guessed?
MAN:

"Hispano Suiza, says the man over there."
He should be on your show.
Is that not the most annoying music?
It is THE most annoying music in the world.
Absolutely.
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(MEN LAUGH)
Only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
- (BABY SCREAMS) - (LISZT GROANS)
"George has gone off, it seems."
- Shall we go and look for her?
- Can you walk?
Not presently.
I need this rest.
My tour next month is 20 cities.

"- Vienna, Geneva..."
You're going on a tour?
"Darling, did I forget to tell you?"
"What of your writing, your work?"
What of me?
Am I going with you?
We'll talk about it later.
Sophie!
We're going back.

Look at you!
Pop-Pop's little Dale Evans!
Dale Evans was a movie cowgirl back in the '50s.
"She wrote the song ""Happy Trails"""
"and I used to sing that to you when you were on the potty, when we were saying good-bye to your poops!"
Remember?
"Don't watch me, Pop-Pop."
It's embarrassing.
Just wait for me at the car.
(snorts)
What in the world?
"Well, aren't you a horse of a different everything?"
"She's a cutie, huh?"
(laughing):
Yeah.
Looks like you left your horse in the dryer too long.

I think she likes you.
Awesome. (laughs)

Get some therapy!
"Finally, please, get some help!"
-You get some therapy!
-I don't need it!
-That is exactly your problem!
-My problem?
You're unbelievable!
This is why I never come back!
Things always spin out of control with you!
You're like a 2-year-old.
Like a fucking infant!
How did you get to be so rigid?
At least I'm living in reality!
At least I have dignity!
Dignity?
Jesus!
Why are you so afraid?
Afraid?
What are you talking about?
You're insane!
Jane?
"I'm sorry, can I ask you to step outside?"
"Fuck you, Phillip."
I'm sorry-- Can I get you some ice?
Yes!
I know.
I know.
We can't just leave him.
Either he's gutted or scalped.
"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.
"All right, shit, then, buddy."
Get him up.
You want to take him?
(GLASS GROANING)

"You know, this was her idea."
"I mean, she wanted to do it."
"The kid loves me, so why not do it?"
"Whatever time there is, huh?"
"I'm with you, Jimmy."
"- Are we ready to go, Jimmy?"
"- Yeah, I've been ready for 1 4 years."
- She's the one that's had cold feet.
- Go on.
"Robin Wirkus, do you take Jimmy Wexler to be your lawful wedded husband?"
You have to take another year.
I started when I was thirteen.
Then you can drink your coffee without crying on my nose?
Do not make fun of a grown man.
'You thought I was tough?
-I Was.
You wash the dishes?
"I'm glad I came, Henning."
I do not like it here after what happened.
So let's run away?
Play a little water on the fire.
"Nixon, where are you?"
Please answer me!
Are you hurt?
Not a scratch.

Nothing.
"The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken."
But I already got Jerd to fix it.
So it's ok.
Hey!
You sent my work to Jerd.
That really sucks.
C'mon it was just a little job.
You're quite exciting.
Slick Dimitry's services were excellent.
I'm just glad I never paid at front.
I'll tell Estelle you did itwell.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door Do you hear me?"
I gotta hurt all old dump in back of my truck downstairs.

"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?

Now make sense of 'em.
"""Exhibit A""."
Will you stop getting 'em out your bag?
It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."
"""Troy's Noise""."
Sounds French.
It's not just rhymes.
Access granted.
"All right, Project Cadmus."
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.
"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?

Women today fast for the long lives of their husbands.
You should know all this.
I do.
But how am I concerned?
Oh God!
I thought you'd fast and pray...
I've called so many other women over.
Okay.
I'll ask them to return.
No.
Let them be since they're here.
But ask me before you do it next time.
Tea?

I want to hear Macarena!
Not now.
We have guests.
You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.
I'm ready.
How do I look?
You always look good.
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!
"Yeah, it's okay."
Look.
It's written in my notebook.
Right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.

"Oh, no, no, no, no."
You can't blame yourself.
It was at midnight.
"He's got your looks, too."
And your brains.
Oops!

It's a date.
You eat 'em.
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Right.
Shh!
Shh!
Marion!

And when?

Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
"- I mean, there's proof of that?"
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
"They asked Alex to skip a grade, too..."
"- It's not a competition, Claire."

"I just always thought she was, you know..."
- So did we.
Yeah.

Yeah.

"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"
Secret.
"Ah, a present."
"Sort of, yes."
Don't mention it.

[EMF METER HUMMING]

How's the non-violence assembly going?
"Shoving a kid's arm into a Cuisinart is not a ""healthy display of anger."""
The kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?
Which only comes from a pissed-off spirit.
It's gotta be ghost possession.
-That's pretty rare.
"-Yeah, but it happens."
"They get angry enough, they could take control of a person's body."
"So, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
Ok.
Oh... you know you love it.
"Ooh, you like that?"
"Huh, what about here?"
"Oh, work it."
Work it.
You better tag me in all these photos.
"Ok, I like that."
Oh.

Do I ever think about marriage?
"To who, you?"
No.
Never.
No.
"Do you ever think about, you know having a family."
Kids?
"Yeah, I mean I want to."
Do you ever think about marrying a guy?
Maybe.
If they ever make it legal.
Or if I ever move to Canada.
Right.
"What about you, Dale?"
Do you ever want to get married?
"Excuse me, Dale?"

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!
- l need you now!
- Now?
You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?
I wouldn't do that!
She is in such a state.
Hanne...
I know a girl who felt just like you.
Her parents stopped talking after they broke up.
You know what she did?
"Hi, darling."
Long time no see!
- Do you still do boxing?
- I've just won a big fight.
We're celebrating.
- Is something wrong?
- Will you help me?
Sure.
Are you scared?
Better now?
Maybe you should check the basement.
Sofie?
Sofie?
Can you hear me?
Sofie?
Stop...
- You wanted me to do it.
- I'm not in the mood now.
Stop it!
You and your sister have fucked half the Edge tonight; now it's my turn.
Fuck you!
You bitch!
Sofie?
What's up with her?
Do you want me to call anyone?
My mother and father.
Both of them.
Let's eat.
-All right.
-I want to get some of that Waldorf pressed duck.
-I hear it's real...
-Pressed duck?
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.
-Ooh.
They press it by hand with pleats.
-(laughter)
-Come on.
Let's eat.
"Okay, waiter, dessert!"
"(laughter, indistinct protesting)"
What's the matter with you guys?
"What, are you folding already?"
Is this the squad I led that took Hill 405?
405?
That was to the right of us.
-We took Hill 406.
-That wasn't 406.
That was a Japanese pillbox on the right of us.
"Ah, you're all wrong."
"Please, please, it was Hill 405."
-I'll show you how...
-406!
You're nuts.
"Now, wait a second."
-Move the battlefield back.
-Okay.
Let's clear the whole table.
"Very simple-- if you'll just pay attention,"
"Well, I know what I've got here."

They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
Senor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
"If you insist, senor."
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.

"Contract or no, I'll blast-"

"Eric, look out!"
After him!

Ow!
Say good-bye to your sweetheart.
Aah!
Babies!
My poor little poopsies.
"Eric, you've gotta get away from here."
"No, I won't leave you."
"You pitiful, insignificant fools!"
Look out!
Now I am the ruler ofall the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
So much for true love!
"She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?"
"Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty."
Children got to be free to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
I-I...
Did.
"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...
God!
Why did you have to tell me?
Want some coffee or something?
Let's sit here.
I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.

"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?

He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.

"Yes, yes."
"And this is my son, Hogarth."
"Thank you, Annie."
Hobart.
That's Hogarth!

(KNOCKING)
Kent Mansley.

I wasn't gonna say that.
"I have something for you, Hogarth."
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
Up at the power station.
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?
"See anything unusual, Hogarth?"
"No... thing... unusual, really."
(TOILET FLUSHES)
Gotta use the bathroom.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(GASPS)
"Strange, he's so tightlipped now."
And the other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
(CHUCKLING) A hundred-foot robot?
"Wait, the Chemical Brothers?"
I don't think...
"Oh, you've heard of them."
"Wait, wait, wait, look."
"- Look, look, look."
"- Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"The Chemical Brothers, okay."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, they have their own Wikipedia article, and everything."
Wow.
"Now, they're real brothers, right?"
"- Well, I would hope so."
- [Laughing]
"Well, this is nice."
"Very impressive, huh?"
"- Yes, it is."
It's cool.
- Very nice.
- That's cool.

"Oh, thank you, Christine."
We're just gonna throw those in the salad.
- Okay.
- And let's eat.
- It's time to eat.
- 'Cause we're hungry.
"- Yeah, I'm hungry."
- And I'm saying the blessing this time.
"Daddy, don't be too long winded this time, please."
"Make it two minutes this time, two minutes."
Okay?
Ken:
Stop.
Fresco.
"Hold up, hold up."
I do something wrong?
Nah.
I'm saying I want the whole thing tonight.
Oh.
Wow.
You cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah?
"I don't want to see shit, a'ight?"
You won't see nothing.
Okay.
Damn.
(Gasping)
Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.
Whatever.
Really?
Seven years and not once.
Cool.

Pinto!
Why do you harp Pinto the whole day?
You pronounce it improperly!
He always add 'S' after an English word.

People have one father in the world.
And we have 5.5 lakhs fathers.
Right!
"Papa, you shouldn't do that!"
- Yes!
Hey!
I will thrash you!
Papa adds S. But why are you interfering?
I will thrash you.
He is a fool..

I brought you from the street!
From the orphanage!
I gave him clothes!
I gave it to him!
So did I give an application?

- I'm sure.
"Well, let's get started, then."
Why don't you open to page 3 5 and read?
Do you prefer on the top or below?
I beg your pardon?
The reading.
I should read on the top?
"You mean, should you stand up?"
I'm sorry.
"I thought so, too."
- What else do you do?

I'm a nurse.
I'm better at nursing...

God!
I can't believe I'm in such a foul mood.

Are you OK?
Turn left in the village.

They're free tickets.

"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
"No, I am not a police officer."

Just do what I say.
Now go!
Where the hell are we going?
"Mr. Hong, where've you been?"
Stay there.
"And something sweet, like a cookie or a piece of candy."
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.
I don't have that CD.
Uh-oh.
That's ourfavorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.
"Oh, but look."

"Don't forget the towel, the washcloths or the cookie."

Ready to do this?
- I am.
- Yeah?

"Okay, here are the rules."
You have to keep this pillow on your face.
You can't watch us.
- Okay.
- You can't touch us.
You can't touch our heads.
And we're not going to touch each other.
"And you have to tell us when you're going to ""scooch."""
- Okay.
"- So, take off your pants."
You got any problems picking up the van?
No.
"All right, so it's all filled up, we're ready to go?"
Filled up?
Riley.
"Come on, man."

No...
I'm sorry.
You mad?
"I'm not mad, I just,"
I'm disappointed.
All right?
You're my crew.
So bring your A game.
I'll go do it right now.
"No, forget it."
"I mean, we have enough time tomorrow morning to fill up the tank."
It's the principle of the thing.
Let's just go over this again.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

What's he doin' here?
Just hear 'im out.
No.
"Connor, I just came by to say that"
I appreciate all the help.
Jellyfish.
"Yeah, I'm really just helping my sister out."
So...
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no."
I understand.
"You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all."
"- Yes, sir."
"- Yes, yes."
You have that cooped-up feeling.
Yes.
"You do understand, don't you?"
"- Yes, yes."
"- Well, then..."
"Well, now, where would we go?"
We might go to Albert Hall.
Yes.
And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"
We could play cards.
"But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you?"
You might read to me.
Yes.
Yes.
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.
"I hardly think she'd have the nerve to appear, let alone testify."
Have you heard what happened?
I was there.
I saw it.
You...
You mean you saw the man?
Did I?
"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.
"You know, Nancy never had a chance."

"But, but, sir, I've got an eyewitness!"
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing...

For my brothers.
They are all I think about.
Are they even alive?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.

There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.

- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.

It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"- Sir, they're gonna be fine."
- They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
"- Well, I'm not gonna let it."
Let's go.

Put it under there.
What are you doing that for?
I'm just passing the time.
"If you really love me, then let's make a vow... right here, together... right now."
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
Repeat after me-
I'm gonna be free.
I'm gonna be free.
And I'm gonna be brave.
I'm gonna be brave.
Good.
And the next one is-
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
"Oh, that's good."
You like that?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
Fantastically.

Get some air.
Go on.

"Breathe in, breathe out."
All right.
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
Because I got bad knees.
That's better.
"Okay, now listen."
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
"You want attorney-client privilege, don't you?"
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it.
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it."
"That's it, come on."
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.
"Come on, already."
Come on.

It happened so fast.
Let's page Corday.
"Hey, Trina, you did really good."
"Rest up now, okay?"
"For us to get to work here, we need a real description."
I saw one of them.
I think he was black.
"Driver, get out nice and calm."
Face the vehicle.
- Welcome to the ' hood.
"- Passenger, come around to this side."
Face the vehicle.
Put your hands up on the roof.
Grab the roof.
"Hey, man, take it easy."
License and registration's in the glove.
"- Hey, what are we being stopped for?"
- Easy.
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...

Mm-Hmm?
I got about 10 minutes left
On my chicken and potatoes.
I'm gonna go upstairs and talk
To colleen about what happened
In school today.
"You know, it is so not OK to"
Slap your classmate in the
Middle of class.
I'll handle it.
She's out of control.
"Hey, I'll handle it."
I like uncle Johnny.
He's so nice.
He never gets mad.
He never yells at us.
And he never does that thing
That daddy does where he would
"Say something and then, like, a"
"Few seconds later, he'd have to"
Explain that he didn't mean what
He just said.
"Oh, you mean sarcasm."
Yep.
Have you seen a... wet boy running around here?
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.
"We have witnessed no moist children of the masculine variety gallivanting within these halls, no."
"Oh, hey, Poll."
How's it going?
Oh...
"Hi, Matt."
"You, er, you thought about what I asked you?"
"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."
- What?
- The racket and the whole 5000 votes.
- After you nearly killing the guy?
- Go on.
Beat it.
- Are you staying here?
- Yep.
- So am I.

They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
It wasn't my call.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
[Yelling]
"Come on, Kamen!"
I'm sorry.
"No, Kaman!"
Please don't!
"Oh, God!"
[Screaming]
[Screaming continues]
[Tires screeching]
[Car horn blaring]
[Siren blares]
[Hotch] Yeah.
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
- He was fired seven months ago.
- [Garner] Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.
[Siren wailing]
[Train whistle blaring]
Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
- [Indistinct]
- Get out of here.
- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"Oh, you think you're pretty good, do you?"
I am deadly accurate in everything I do.
Old Mr. Chads here.
The meanest teacher I ever had.
"- Oh, he was harmless."
- Mm-mm.
"Easy for you to say, he liked you."
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
That's because he never knew
I was the one putting' gum on his seat.
"Oh, that was you?"
"He'd jump up all wiggly and squirmy, grabbing' at his backside, th... that squeaky little voice of his cooing like a pigeon."
"Ooh, ooh."
[laughing]
- [cork popping]
- Ooh!
[laughing]
Social studies.
Why do we even need to know the state capitols?
I'm never going to Kansas.
Topeka.
Show off.
Vermont.
Montpelier.
Wyoming.
Cheyenne.
Deadly accurate.
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
- [gasping]
"- Come on, come on, come on, come on."
Shh.
Let me get the door.
We want our mom back.
Have you gone crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You're not our mom.
To your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I've had it.
"Anything else, maybe?"
( Door slams )
I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mom.
- Properly.
You're my mom.
Look at me.
"You're my mom, you're my mom..."
Louder.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
Stop this foolishness!
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?
There'll be only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
And promise me not to talk to your brother!
No.
( slap )
Promise me.
He's not going to die.
You wanted me.
- Why did you kill Foon?
- White Tiger killed him.
You're harboring a fugitive!
"Yes, so what?"
"While you're still alive, I'll only be second-best."
Only Lion's Roar Hall can beat Bo Chi Lam.
You've committed a terrible crime!
You must pay for it!
You're my problem!
Sifu Wong...
Stop!
"Sifu Wong, spare me!"
Please let me go!
Let me go!
I apologize!
I'll turn over a new leaf!
Careful!
"Sifu Wong, I'm sorry!"
"Mousy, go!"
I won't abandon Sifu in his hour of need!

I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!

"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."

"Mother, they are from Belgium."
They have to get to Sofia.
"They need a bus, can you imagine?"
A bus?
Here?
- Or a taxi.
- There are no taxis here.
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?
"- Um, I don't know what that means."
- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
"Hello, this is..."
"Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin."
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I'm sleeping.
- Hello.
- Hello?
"- Yes, is Professor Larkin there?"
- Who?
"I mean, is Professor Morgan there?"
- Barely.
Who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.
I'm a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see
- how you are tonight.
- I'm fine.
How you are?
Fine.
"I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me, but I sat down in one of your classes."
And I was very impressed.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
Hold on.
- Wait.
Could you talk louder please?
- I sat in on your class.
- Hold on.
Don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!
"- Hello, can you hear me?"
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
[Baby Crying]
[Clicks]
What happened?
[Yawns]
"Mmm, that crazy kid."
[Chuckles]
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
[Yawns]
Where's the keys?
[Mumbling] Over there.
[Yawns]
[Gasps]
- Hi there.
- [Door Shuts]
[Yawns]
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
Thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
[Yawns]
Your scrapbook is like you- a mess.
"Gimme my pants, will ya?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
WOMAN 1:
You're doing a great job.
"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget."
Hi!
WOMAN 2:
"Oh, my goodness."
- Think about it.
Think about it on your own.
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.
Stop kidding around.
Echizen's not coming again today?
What did you hear about it?
Don't worry about it?
Looks like he came to school though.
What happened?
Is it a cold?
It is a cold.
"- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?"
- Ah...
What do you mean something happened?
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?
At least help me a little.
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.
"Ryoma, let's have a game."
- Don't want.
- Good.
Heh?
"Oi, Ryoma."
"{\pos(192,242)}I'm bored."
What's up?
"{\pos(192,242)}Why?"
"Ya, they want those training camp."
Why?
"{\pos(192,242)}Sure."
"{\pos(192,242)}See you then."
"Mum there's still one more week, right."
I understand.
Yes.
Yes.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
- All okay.
- Yes father.
Shall we go?
Bravo!
What?
Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
[Jessie] What's going on?
- Are you Richard Sammler?
- l am.
We have a warrant.
is there another computer?
"- No, just the kids'."
- Take that too.
- [Jessie] My report!
- Sweetie.
What are you looking for?
"It's in the warrant, read it."
Have your family stand aside.
- Can they do this?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my God."
"- Hey, watch it!"
"Sir, listen, stand aside now."
[man] into the back bedroom.
"Look, Rick, I've just come from the DA's office."
Where you've been spending a lot of time.
Mason Gould is on 3.
- The opportunity to clear your name.
- On TV?
- You didn't know about the bribes?
"- No, absolutely not."
I want the two of us to face this like people who love each other do.
I can't do that right now.
Ripped By mstoll
Go!
Go!
Go!
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
Do you remember the coat?
- No.
- You do so!
You used to keep it spotless except for your dandruff.
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!
"After you bought it, you stopped trying... to get me to go into the fields with you."
"It was the best contraceptive... ever invented, that coat."
It's in the attic.
How are ya?
"How are ya, Sharon?"
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?
Ha ha ha!
"Yeah, well, I am."
She's bleedin' serious!

"Yeah, Sharon."
Congrats.

"It's terrible, really."
"- How long you gone, Sharon?"
- Sixteen weeks.
You don't look it.
I do.
I won't argue.
You're the expert.
I'm only messin'.
"Crazy, this."
"One red one you eat, another you don't."
"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?
!
I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
He raised me.
"I want to graduate, find a good job, and repay my Grandpa."
Hey.
Kick me.
Come on.
With all your might.
Are you OK?
Your posture is good.
You can learn ShaoIin Kung Fu.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu?
I want to spread the art of Shaolin.
It was my Grandpa's dream.
OK...
I can try.
really?
If you try Iacrosse.
Alright!
Yeah!
Come!
Wait!
What's lacrosse?
The future is veiled in darkness.
"Reach out to it without fear, and you will see light."
Do not stop.
Do not hesitate.
Accept the challenge.
The possibilities are infinite.
Set your inner power free!
Get it all!
"I am Yuichiro Ooba, President of Seikan international University."
I'm speaking to all our present and future students.
Our university will support your...
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.
"- No, not for me."
ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
GIANT:
Hogarth.
(WHIMPERS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
"Nautilus to Rogard, missile armed and ready."
"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.
Attacking him is triggering a defense mechanism.
"Don't listen, General!"
Destroy the monster while we still have the chance!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"General, you shoot and the whole thing starts all over again."
- Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
"- Orders, sir?"
"Which is why you have got to stop, General!"
- It's getting closer!
"Orders, sir?"
- Don't shoot!
"-Uh, substitute coach Roth."
DEAN:
Yes.
Miss Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Miss B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous--
[BLOWING WHISTLE]
-Take a lap.
-But--
[DOOR CLOSES]
Go nuts.
[STUDENTS CHATTERING]
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Find anything?
"Been over the entire school twice, no sulfur."
"No sulfur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
"-I don't know, maybe I was wrong."
-It happens to the best of us.
"We hit the road, huh?"
"But after lunch, it's, uh, sloppy-joe day."
[BOY SCREAMS]
[GROANING]
"Good hustle, Colby."
Walk it off.
[WHIRRING]
TEACHER:
"Always make sure that your cover is securely fastened, Jamie."
"Hey, I need to copy your Algebra homework again."
What was that?
Great!
Awesome!
What do we do?
No!
Jason!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.
"Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!"
You know what?
Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
What are you doing?
We will see how she does in the office.
I am sure she is going to do well.
"She is my friend, after all."
- Yeah.
"Anyway, you guys carry on."
I will see you later.
Yeah?
You witch..
'I am writing this diary only because..'
'..my mom wants me to maintain a diary.'
'My first day in office today.'
Gul.
"Hi, mom."
How are you?
I am fine.
You tell me.
I told you to call me up after you reach office.
"I am so sorry, mom."
I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.
How is your office?
"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.
Gul.
"Okay, mom."
I got to go.
Pia is calling me.
I am very late for office.
Listen.
I suppose?
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
It's a red-brick wing.
St. Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
"He has black hair, and he's intense-looking."
Damien Karras.
That's his office behind St. Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.
"Had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
"She was living by herself, and I guess she was dead a couple days before they found her."
Cunting hun!
Bloody damn butchering Nazi pig!
Stop it!
I'll kill you!
Aah!
Leave him alone!
Get out!
Get out!
[Shouting]
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
[Drunken singing]
Whoa!

Ok.
Everybody fall back!

"Will do, Pete."
[V.C. CHEERING]
What happened to Nim?
"He bought the farm, sir, but he took a lot of them with him."
COSTA:
Colonel Kirby.
Puff the Magic Dragon's on the horn.
This is Two-Niner Savoy.
Over.
"Puff to ground, where do you want it?"
Put it on the camp.
"Those people have it, we don't."
It'll only take a minute.
I think Puff broke their back.
We can probably move in there tomorrow God willing and the river don't rise.
MacDANIEL:
You know something?
You're all well.
Candy.
"Here, that's for you."

[CHIEF SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
BECKWORTH:
L'll take her.
DOC:
Right here will do it.
Little girl's his granddaughter.
She stepped on a Punji stick.
He's afraid she's going to die.
- How is it?
- It's a nasty wound and it's infected.
"But if we can control it, she'll be all right."
Good as new.
Pretty tough way to find out about Punji sticks.
BECKWORTH:
Sure is.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
This is the Chieftain of the village.
Does he speak English?
NIM:
"No, sir."
He must trust us.
"How's that, sir?"
Letting Sergeant McGee take care of his granddaughter.
- Tell him to come in.
"Come on, Red."
Bring him along!
Come on!
[MEN YELLING]
"Don't be like that, pal."
"Come on, this is gonna be swell."
"Look, I got a nice little one for you too."
Come on.
[SIREN WAILING]
[HORN BLOWING]
There.
You're out of it anyway.
[GUARDS CHATTERING]
"Men, stay out of it."
Don't be suckers.
You can't fight machine guns and riot guns.
"Go back to your machines, you hear--"
Get going!
Come on!
Let's go!
MAN:
"No, I won't go in there!"
[MEN SHOUTING]
We're heading for the warden's!
There he is!
[MEN SHOUTING]
"Lock the door, get in the mailroom and stay there."
Pull 'em up!
You're crazy.
"Put up those guns, men!"
I'm giving the orders now.
You're taking us through them gates!
What the hell was that?
"The retrovirus is having the opposite effect, than we intended."
I guess so.
Oh God.
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
Ellia please!
This isn't you!
Zaddik!
Are you alright?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
Come on.
"No, no, you people need to go back to the village."
It is not safe here!
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No.
It can't be.
You were taken by the Daemus.
No father.
Father?
I don't understand.
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
Precisely.
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
Is it still a long way?
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
I can't go so fast
It hasn't changed
"Hey, wait, slow down, I have to pee"
One for all and all for one
Let's stop here
"With a horse, at least nobody has to pedal"
It's dirty
You're never happy
"Look, it's Charles"
A breakdown?
You can't get anywhere
"- Okay, you win."
Come on.
"- Oh, thank you"
Take care of my bike
"Hey, what're you doing?"
- lm looking for something.
- What?
Would it be a Swiss knife?
"Yeah, I suppose"
How come you've got it?
"In a way, I did a trade"
For what?
A secret
What?
It's about Charles.
You can tell he's in love
You sure?
He's sticking his lips out
Hey.
I'm looking to score.
"You know, party favors."
"Come on, Coreen."
Do you want angel tears or crow?
Angel tears?
"Come on, come on..."
"angel tears is acid, crow is cocaine."
Come on.
I'm actually looking for something a little different.
"Evan told me about it, but I can't remember the name."
Venom?
That's it.
Venom.
Do you know where I can find any?
Something I said?
I've got a lead.
Over.
Oh!
Wynter.
"Hey, I hear you're looking for some venom."
"Yeah, do you know where I can get some?"
Um-hum...
How about straight from the source.
First time's free.
- You don't have to do this.
- You're wrong.
- I do.
- Ugh...oh...!
Let's be on our way.
- Why?
"- Well, didn't you know?"
"It's an island rum, infused with the essence of the coconut fruit."
Delicious.
Yes?
You like?
Very much.
Yes.
That's yummy.
It is yummy.
"It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it?"
Mmm.
Yes.
"Oh, oh..."
"Slow down there, killer."
"You see, this island has so many healing curiosities."
"You know, it is good to have a drink and have a good time."
Then do it!
"Well, I guess we just go around, huh?"
"No, we gotta go through."
The path ends.
"We go off the path, we get lost+ Come on."
"No, hey, we'll make a new path."
What if there's people in there?
Joey!
"Be careful, sweetie."
"Ronnie, I'm Cynthia."
I'm always careful!
Yes!
Okay.
Okay.
Get in there.
"You,re leaving fingerprints!"
I don't know what you're doing...
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
You were lucky.
But if you go out.
you'll die like a dog.
Where is she?
She's in a place where you can never find her.
Never.
Where?
Outside your apartment.
"Hello, you've reached Nathalie Thomas who's not here for now, or only in this bi-dimensional, digital and pixelised version..."
Hello.
Mom.
You're calling me?
- Yes.
It's the first time.
No.
I've called you before.
No.
Really.
It's the first time in eight years.
I would have called.
But...
I would have come to the hospital.
but they had already brought you home and said you had to rest.
What got into you.
Thomas?
I was worried.
At least.
You're OK.
That's what's important.
How are you feeling?
You look good.
- I'm fine.
- What's his problem?
- You're my problem!
"The way you're treating people, asshole!"
I tried to keep my mouth shut.
Who is that man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But be nicer to your customers.
I'm sorry.
Very sorry.
Please forgive us.
What the hell is this?
- You're scary.
"- I just yell, that's all."
- Have a cigarette.
- Yes.
- Let's go someplace else.
"- Director Kim, that wasn't right."
What?
You shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't treat people like that.
Go and apologize.
I'm serious.
Go apologize.
What's wrong with you?
You don't do that to people!
Even if he's a waiter!
This isn't right.
"Go and apologize, okay?"
- You really should.
- I won't!
Why on earth should I?
I can look like a man.
What do you think?
- How is Maria Concetta?
- She escaped.
"Then you didn't get anything, is that it?"
"Yes, and you're going blind."
You're even wearing glasses|.
"Well, the doctor says..."
It's just that my eyes are exhausted.
Are you worried about syphilis?
"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.
Very good!
Very good!
So why are you scratching?
True.
Quiet!
I was waiting for you.
Everything alright?
"Yes, it's fine."
It's hot.
It's hot.
"- Go on, push."
- It hurts.
It's too hot.
"Ice, I want ice."
Give me a bit of ice.
- Not coffee.
He wants ice.
"- Ice, I want ice."
Impossible.
Impossible.
- Yes?
- I wanna give you something.
- No.
"Yes, please."
I recently became ordained.
Weird story.
"Um, and I wanna be the one to marry you guys."
- Wait.
What?
!
"- Yeah, what?"
Yeah.
I think this is why I became a minister.
"No, you became a minister to piss off that dude at the restaurant."
"[Laughs] Oh, my Sweet Lord thundering Jesus!"
"Yeah, before you start crying there, Rob, we don't have time for a wedding."
All I have to do is sign a piece of paper.
W-would you have time for a little ceremony?
"God, no."
It would mean the world to my little lady.
Ew!
"Please, we'd be hitched by noon, I swear."
- Okay.
I'd be...
I'd be honored to.
- [Laughing]
"Oh, my lord!"
Oh!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Oh!
"- Yeah, just... uh, no, no."
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
Roger and out.
"Savoy 6, this is Bulldog."
"Go ahead, Bulldog."
We have the Mike Force in position.
Let us know when you're ready.
"Roger, Bulldog."
Savoy 6.
We'll use the air strike to keep Charlie's head down.
Execute plan 3 in 2 minutes.
Do you roger?
Roger.

Fall back to the commo bunker!
Everybody!
MacDANIEL:
Let go with the phoogas!
SOLDIER:
Let's go!
Keep down.
Take a platoon down and reinforce Evans.
I'm going to the tower.
KIRBY:
What's the situation?
We can't even hold this place with that air strike.
KIRBY:
Provo!
Dig that .30 in and give support to the .50 caliber.
PROVO:
"Give me that, I can handle it."
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
- Yang flame.
"- Yang flame, too?"
"Wong Fei-hung, are you trying to kill me?"
Put the fire out!
Don't kill me!
It really works!
That's enough!
Feeling better?
You're good!
Good!
Bastard!
How dare you hit me!
How many hands did you fight with?
You're incredible!
I'm completely won over!
See you soon!
I hate the cut of this jacket!
You can have it.
- Hey!
"Hey, don't go!"
- Let him go.
He didn't make a donation.
- Forget it.
Get ready for the lion dance.
"- Yes, Sifu."
SOUTHERN RIVER ASSOCIATION
Keep this.
Firecrackers.
"Fellow villagers, welcome to the opening of the Southern River Association."
"We're honored to have the lion-dance master from Po Chi Lam,"
"Sifu Wong Fei-hung, and his disciple Leung Foon."
"Maybe I can help, you know."
You just need to communicate.
See this book?
It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."

You catch the game last night?
"Nah, just the lowlights."

(Toilet flushing)
I don't want that shit.
Slap that bitch right there.
Everything going all right?
Everything is everything.
You got pay stubs for me?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's up?"
Any police contact?
Hey.
Any police contact?
"Nah, nah."
All right.
Everything's looking on the up and up.
Stay away from the bullshit.
You're doing all right.
I'll see you next week.
All right.
(Women giggling)
(Angela) Enrique?
"Yeah, in the bathroom, ma."
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
"Jack, grab this chair."
We'll meet you downstairs.
"All right, there we go."
You okay?
I'm getting lots of experience at this.
"First, Detective Medavoy, now him."
SlPOWlCZ:
You holding up okay?
ERNIE:
Yeah.
"- Jack, just set the chair there."
JACK:
All right.
SlPOWlCZ:
Thanks.

SlPOWlCZ:
All right.
"James, you want to give me a second here?"
"Sure, let me get the paperwork."
You okay?
Yeah.
"You got my card, you know, if you feel like talking."
You feel like talking?
"I can't remember most of it, being over there."
I don't want to remember it either.
SlPOWlCZ:
Good luck.
James.
"Counselor, can I have a word with you in private?"
I want us to be square about that fish.
"Andy, I don't think we're going to make it."
Out of my sight!
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
We're live on the scene talking to a witness.
"Tell us what you saw, sir."
MAN:
"Well, I saw one sheep jump over the fence."
And then two sheep.
Three sheep.
Four sheep.
Five sheep.
Six sheep.

FEMALE HOST 2:
We have Gwyneth Paltrow talking down to us about acting and parenting.
I can do this.
All I need's another cap of coffee.
I don't know why people say staying up all night messes with your mind.
What do you think Donnie Darko rabbit?

"They're,like, you know, caffeine or something."
"And what about operation ""Sky Girl""?"
It's today or never.
- A picture.
- Alright.
Let's go over there.
Major Beckwith...
"Antonio, come and take a picture."
The poor thing's an orphan.

"- Yes, of course, here."
Smile for the camera.
Lucia...
"Come here, hurry up."
The Americans.
"It was dark, but I think it was here."
"- Yes, around here."
- Hello.
Why don't you take one of these?
"You're all too tall, Jimmy."
Take one home with you.
The Americans need to go back to reasonable proportions.
Do you ever take anything seriously?
Sometimes...
Yes.
"No, you're like all the other Italians."
- Are you going to help me or not?
- No.
- What's going on ladies?
- How are you?
- Are you free today?
- A kiss.
This is the place.
I would.
I know you would.
–Who did this to you?
–Fleetwood.
That prick that got Joe kicked off the force?
Yeah.
Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.
Okay.
You gotta stop him.
"–Come on, guys."
We're losing blood.
–Just hang in there.
–Gotta go.
–Just hang in there.
"Detective Wyms, Carlson just called."
There's a homeless guy with a bloody machete saying he killed somebody.
–Where?
–Just south of Bell on Vine.
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?
I don't know.
Maybe he's checking in on Vic.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet.
Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
They got the guy?
"–Sir, put the knife down, please."
–I'll kill again!

My lunch box....
There we go.
Don't you be scared.
I'll stay with you until we take you upstairs.
- I made it in school.
- It's beautiful.
- It's for you.
- Thank you.
- Nice.
- Yeah.

- We won't be needing your surgeon.
- Excuse me?
- My plastic surgeon's coming.
- Who?
- Fred.
- Fred Mendoza?
He'll cost a fortune.
- It's only your daughter's face.
"- No, I hate him."
That's why you called.
- He's the best in Chicago.
For lopsided breasts.
Touchy subject.
- Is he all right?
- Mouth-to-mouth's not working.
- His airway's blocked.
- Paramedics are coming any minute.
- That Medevac copter will take us.
- That's a TV news chopper.
Leon:
"Yeah, like Batboy."
- Can we Batboy him?

Who cares?
Whatever.
"I don't vote, I think it's annoying."
- Sylvie.

"Hey, Ricky."

I've had everybody in the department looking for Pete.
"You know, I mean, I've got someone in every precinct."
"We put out a silver alert, even though he's not old enough, we got his picture everywhere."
- That's great.
- Been checking even tri-state departments.
- Wow.
- Friends up in New Jersey state.
"I mean, we've looked everywhere, guys."
Nothing.
Nothing's turning up.
He ain't been to see Trisha.
Nothing.

I sat in on one of your classes.

- I don't know.
Gregory Larkin.
Math department.
Columbia.
The theory of implicit differentiation is often thought of as complex.
"Uh, but in reality it is quite simple."
It's simply a matter of pretending that Y is a function of X.
"And so, um..."
Mmm.
Hi.
"Oh, hi."
- I saw you pass by.
- I was just passing by...
- I'm sorry about calling the other night...
- I was so confused.
- Are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.
Good.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Moi aussi.

It's the first time we are playing against one another.

"You're not playing badly eh, Tezuka."
"Come on, Carol."
You have everything.
You are so successful.
Hire a maid to do all these chores.
I can afford ten maids.
But one achieves success with..
"..patience, honesty and hard work."
That's why I do these small household chores.
It's not my job.
Even in Jaipur my servants do all this.
I have come to Mumbai to be very famous.
And in this small life I have many great things to do.
I have to go far ahead.
"Pia, I don't understand Gul's lifestyle."
"You will understand, Carol."

He'd never take a drink from me.
He'd suspect foul play!
- I shall be hung!
"- It's ""hanged"", and you won't be."
"Oh, Mumsie!"
I'll go by the service stairs to avoid him.
Is everything clear?
Good.
I'll be in the car at the front.
"The moment he falls insensible, signal from the window."

Why did you come here?
Did anyone see you?
I took the backside stairs.
None saw me.
An important matter.
So...
"Whatever it is, you should have just called me."
Varun is here.
In Erode.
- Varun?
The chef from Chennai.
So what?
He might have come for some official work.
No.
He has come searching for you.
They have seen you at the hotel with Vikram.
I heard the girl with him address you as 'Vasundhara.'
Then they followed you in a car.
I diverted them.
I think they know everything.
They come targeting us.
We shouldn't take further risks.
Drop Vikram.
Let's go.
What?
Listen to me.
Let's leave this right here and go.
"This won't work anymore, Vasundhara."
You always talk negatively!
- No.
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.
Big and ugly.
"Man, this case is just getting better and better."
"If Taggot picked her up, she's probably at his place."
Doubtful.
He's married.
I know.
Right?
Why don't you take the lead on this one?
- Really?
- Sure.
What are you doing?
"Uh, exercise."
I'll meet you up there.
We just need to ask you a few questions about last night.
I'm a little drugged.
Pain killers.
Right.
"Well, this won't take long."
How well do you know off--
How well do you know Officer Taggot?
- Who?
- Officer Taggot.
He your boyfriend?
"No, no."
Then why did he pick you up last night from the hospital?
"That's right, we know about that."
He just--he felt bad that I got hurt.
"Valerie, hey, whoa!"
Focus...
Don't worry about it.
Don't believe him!

Ignore that.
Just ignore that.

I think I better quit while I'm ahead.
"Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?"
You don't have to be a pussy.
"And he's, like, so cranky."
He's so cranky.
Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy...
"Keep talking, Freddy."
Keep talking.
"- Jesus, calm down."
- Keep talking.
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Apologize to the lady.
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.

I can't believe that you just ignored the dirtiest text I've ever sent you.
"Well, dirty text?"
What dirty text?
I didn't get any dirty text.
I got...
"Ooh, geez."
No.
"The last text I got from you said, ""Never mind."
"- I forgot I had eaten beets."""
- No.
(sighs)
- Oh... (murmuring)
- Uh-huh.
I think that's the dirtiest text anybody's ever sent anybody.
You like it like that.
"Well, now I see why I never received it."
(laughs)
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!
Me!

A SUBURBAN TALE
Directed by Sakari Kirjavainen
My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
Is that paint?
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Hey, Gabby!"
"- Take a sample from her left fingers,"
- Left hand.
"Excuse me, Mr. Monk?"
I have a nephew.
He's ten years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man.
Really?
Kids!
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero."
"Sorry, Mr. Monk is working."
Maybe when he's finished.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else?
"Clues, clues, scanning, scanning."
"No, that's it, all done."
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
I got.
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair's in the way.
"Head down, head down."
Are you okay?
- She's fine.
School and then home.
"I promise we'll talk about it later, okay?"
I love you.

Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?

Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?

(GUNS COCKING)
This is Factionless?
This is insane.
Tobias.
Mother.
(WHISPERING) I thought she was dead.
Me too.
Someone please tell me what's going on here.
Tobias' father was very abusive.
I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him would be to disappear completely.
Abnegation helped me fake my death.
Anything to protect Marcus' image.
But you just left him there alone with Marcus?
I was very young-
I reached out to him about a year ago.
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.
(LAUGHS)
On the road.
At the edge of town.

Is it true they wanted to leave town?

Be a good girl.
"Whoa, Annie!"
Just the bars!
Alert the guards!

The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?

Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.

"Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me."
"MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks..."
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!

"- Steal Annie, will they?"
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
"Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?"
"Yes, sahib."

"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
You'll see.
It's a surprise.
"Oh, Flounder."
"Flounder, you're the best!"
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
"[Giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?"
"Oh, this is all so... so sudden."
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."

It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."

"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.

[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?

Inspector!
Inspector Robin!
I've been waiting for you!
For me?

See you then.
"Dennis, I have an idea."
"- Well, this is awesome."
- Yeah.
This is amazing.
There's blood everywhere.
It's beautiful.
"Yeah, and we were totally right."
These guys don't have technique.
They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other.
Look at all this money being thrown around.
"- Dude, we gotta get in on this."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating."
- Yeah.
Get up!
You know who can take a really good beating?
- Charlie.
- Charlie.
Here she is...
The old gym.
Smell that?
- That's the smell of hard work.
- And feet.
That's the smell of big dreams.
The smell of glory.

- And feet.
Does smell like feet.
- Frank?
"- Oh, shit."
Frankie Fast Hands!
"-Well, then, let's climb aboard."
"-No, no, no, wait, Buzz!"
Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative.
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
"-Yeah, bu..."
Buzz!
Buzz!
"That's two lefts and a right, huh?"
"-Thanks for the directions, okay?"
-Yeah.
"And remember, kid..."
Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.
What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift-off is scheduled for
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for immediate pizza...
Sheriff!
There you are.
"Now, the entrance is heavily guarded."
We need a way to get inside.
"Great idea, Woody."
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

"Fung-wu, stand back."
"Your Highness, this wine is!"
"Master, it must be an extra old vintage."
Very smart.

Good move!
This bottle is a gift from the king.
A rare wine!
"Yes, it can stimulate the belly of warriors."
"Master, it's good for your stamina, too."
Check!
You'll lose!
Good move.
Please have a drink!
Master Law!
Thanks!
One more!
"Your Highness, how about you?"
I used to have it every day!
"Try more, this is a good wine."
"Master, you better try one more!"
That's right.
"With good wine and lovely women, everything is changed."
Even a master will ignore his student's presence.
All right.
Go!
Good-dye!
I can't take any more!
A little trout for my little princess.
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Is it that dastard who's making you cry?
I'll kill him!
Luigi!
Renato!
Hello.

Hello.
Don't scream.

Just like that.
You dastard!
Who's that?
Some nut.
Come on!

So the microfilm got to Italy... to the top of the mountain on its own.
I don't give a damn adout the microfilm.
I just want to find Aldin.
You detter give a damn.
It may de our only means of getting him dack.
Why?
If it is the list of their agents... we'll know exactly where to find him.
"Oh, grow up, Robin."
There's no such thing as ghosts.
"Nate, can you please help me?"
Technically...
He's right.
- What?
- Yes.
I... but you're also right.
It feels...
Very wrong.
- Yeah.
- But that is not for you to judge.
"You know, if... if he wants to do this..."
I do.
"And she, for some reason, wants to do this..."
"- Yes, please."
- Nate:
And she approves...
"- Yes, of course."
- Then...
"Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows."
"Robin, let's make this official."
Somebody please object.
I object!
Because I love her!
- [Speaks Russian]
- I know so much about you!
I know you like snack chips.
I like snack chips!
You're a side sleeper.
"I'm a side sleeper, right?"
You read a magazine on the potty.
"Hey there, scout."
Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.
"Hey, there."
Kent MansIey.
Work for the government.
Your parents home?
We're eating.
"Who's there, honey?"
hello there.
Do you have a telephone I couId use?
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here.
Pretend you're a gangster.
-You call me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?
"No, I didn't actually see it."
It went off into the woods.
So you don 't have any evidence?
But I've got an eyewitness!
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing is a menace.
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!
What did?
"tell me again, MansIey, and this time..."
...listen to yourself.
A giant metal monster.
"Please, open the door."
We have a fault.
"Let me out, please, sir."
I'll fix it.
I doubt it.
Fucking idiot.
"You know, Jimmy, there is something about spine snapping"
That never gets old.
- It sounds like...

Or all there's same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man cripples, there's always one question in everyone's mind,"
"Especially in his,"

"Give me your palette, treasure."
Alice did not know who was.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
I have to go.
"Yeah, don't worry."
I got it covered.
Save me some food.
Gus Walker?
This is the FBI.
Careful.
Guess his stolen art isn't an issue anymore.
Okay.
"Yes, ma'am."
Why would Walker steal his own work?
And who killed him?
Someone who knew what they were doing.
No signs of a struggle.
Clean shot.
It's professional.
I've got another question.
Where's the tenth piece?
The tenth piece?
"Yeah, there are nine recovered pieces here."
The surveillance from the gallery shows that Walker had ten photo collages in the show.
So where's the tenth piece?
That was my question.
?
who's here to pay me a visit.
"Special Agent Henson, how are you?"
I'm working.
Jack.
If he's involved...
I said no.
I'm not going to rest this entire investigation on a glance.
"Maybe he was looking past the photo, through the wall, down the street to a church to ask God what in the hell he did to deserve this torture."
"What then, Dr. Ryan?"
I'm done.
Get Wickes in here.
Now.
(over speaker):
"Agent Gibbs, why am I here?"

I'm sorry.
"No, no, I-I'm, I'm just so..."
JARVIS:
"Someone is trying to blackmail me, blackmail the United States Navy."
"Phil, they think it's you."
Are you involved?
No.
He believes him.
You?
Yes.
(door opens)
(sighs)
Wickes say anything else?
He signed a nondisclosure agreement.
"Oh, so he's being cooperative?"
You see what time it is?
What you got that shit on your head for?
Take it off.
Take what off?
"I said, take that shit off!"
"Pa, papi, stop!"
Take it off!

"Sit the fuck down, right now."
"Don't do this, he's not hurting anybody."
Put your fucking hands down.
"You're a fucking man, Michael, You're not a woman!"
"No, no!"

"Why are you defending this shit, huh?"

"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.
We need him.
The business.
I must take him home.
You'd only be taking home his body.
His mind is...
Look for yourself.
I hope that ending was properly terrifying.

"I gotta go, Dad."
They found Ryan.
Or spotted someone who meets his description.
There was a fight down by the pier.
Really?
Which means he's probably still in the area.
We should go try to find him before the authorities do.
Before he gets into any more trouble.

I was going somewhere.

You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.

It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.

Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.

Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."

Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.

Seize her.
Alice.
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then."

The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.

He's my brother...

Are you alright?

Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."

- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.

A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?

- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.

Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.

We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.

"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.

I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.

It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."

What brings you home?
Vacation?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
I can't control it.

"If they offer coffee, we'II give a MiIanese no: categorical."
- How much sugar?
.
"- Two, please."
"You say ""no, thank you."""
Got any fruitjuice?
It's lemon juice he made himself.
"Here's yourregistered letter, yourreceipt, the juice was very good, maybe a bit strong."
It's his Postamat.
"That's wonderful, but we have to run."
Even I didn't understand that.
Goodbye.
Good thing it was a MiIanese no!
"If it was NeapoIitan, we'd have stayed for dinner?"

"When they say ""Want some coffee?"", ""No, thank you."""
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
Hold on.
Hold on.
"Sam, hang it up."
Hang it up.

Why don't I just run a search on his credit card?
Mmm.

Looks like he opened up a tab at Pure about an hour ago.
Thank you.

Damn.
Hey.
You guys see this?
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."
"Ghost of former owner haunts hotel."" What the hell is this?"
I don't know.
Maybe that guy Taylor went to the press.
"What, because we made him pay what he owed?"
"Well, if he thought the story was gonna hurt us, he was wrong."
Bookings are way up.
Haunted hotels...

Quite popular apparently?
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?

That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.

I love you.
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."

Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.

It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.

[Cheers and applause]
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
As to the connection between dreams
And the subconscious mind.

Yes?
Gareth watson.
I was expecting someone a little older.
Uh...
You must be nigel.
Bailey.
Shall we head inside?
I'd like to throw you a bit
"Of a curve, I'm afraid."
I have a contact who called me
To come and meet him.
But we just got here.
He offered to show me a map
To the druid astronomicons.
So I'd like to make the same offer to you.
Don't tell me
You're not interested.
In the keys to stonehenge?
Sure.
I'm sorry to be so last-minute.
My contact just called me himself.
Shall we?
Yeah.
A map to the astronomicons...
They've been lost for 2000 years.
[âª]
Excuse me.
"Gareth watson is signing books here,"
Today?
You could have got someone to post it for you.
"Oh, Come on."
You could've got your mum to post it.
I don't bloody know.
You wanted an alibi.
- Maybe you sent it.
You're blaming me..
- Bullshit!
"Oh, it's you."
You sent it!
Don't listen to him.
"Chris, just fucking admit it!"
Enough.
I want a confession.
We'll keep playing until we get one.
"Truth or Dare, Chris?"
Dare.
You fuck.
Dare it is.
One moment.
"Luke, Luke!"
"- Luke, what the fuck?"
- Help us.
"- I can't, I can't."
- Please.
"We used to call this... the ""acid test."""
Easy to improvise.
"Very, um... useful for motivating prisoners."
"This next part... isn't terribly pretty, I'm afraid."
Open up.
Open up.
"Now, this is much easier... if you relax."
"Veal, twice, please."
"Oh, and semolina pudding?"
Excellent choice.
Too long.
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm all right.
I just found it easier when it was every night.
At least you knew what was coming.
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself--"
- The bombing.
- Ah.
I thought perhaps too many long treks to see the husband in the provinces.
Not really.
"It's difficult, you know?"
The trains.
"- All right, then"
What's that?
"- It's France, Uncle Frank."
- Oh.
- Oh!
It's Hitler!
- Bloody what?
- Meeting now with Mr. Swain.
Rot.
We're about to issue this as a shooting script.
- They want all of you.
"- Oh, no."
"Oh, don't worry."
It gives me the right.
"If my fish accuse to fuck another,"
Then go to fuck another.

Then you just have to kill me.
Do not you?
You need to kill me.
You have no idea.
It's fun to kill people.
You of all people should be to try it sometime.
Fun?
It's fun to kill people?
Did you have fun while You killed my wife and daughter?
Get up.
Get up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I remember your fucking wife.
I remember fucking your wife.
You're too weak.
Too fucking bad.
You're too weak to do something about it.
Son of a bitch!
Under what name are you working at the Ministry?
"Delacroix, Delacunt, Delacock!"
"And then, Jewish names like Ben Asshole that smell fishy in the Ministry?"
Stop your bullshit!
Lay off.
He's honest.
Like honest?
"Be honest, then!"
Keep it simple and straight.
You love her how much?
You don't get it.
She's very expensive.
Sorry...
Thank you...
It's not right to burn people.
I'll give you everything.
"My name, my memories, my life."
My handkerchief.
"Throw me away whenever you want, if you have to."
Idiot.
"Don't get hooked, that's my woman."
You want to love her too?
"- Yes, that's my handkerchief."
- And me?
Oh yes!
And you?
Maybe.
Lovers...
Friends...
A meeting of ends.
"I'm taking her, she's too decent for you!"
- Looks serious.
You've got to show them...
You have to stick it right up them...
you have to flabbergast them.
- What do I do?
- Put in first gear.
- Where's the handle?
- There.
Put it into second.
"On the left, by your leg."
Press the clutch at the same time.
Your left leg!

"Oh, I'm sorry!"
"Hit me, to check I'm not dreaming!"

"- Marjorie, are you all right?"
"- Yes, I think so."
But where have you been?
Locked in a garage.
Had to dig my way out.
I got here as soon as I got the police.
"- No, I love it."
It's perfect.
- Good.
- One with everything on it.
"- Make that two, please."
"So, how's..."
- Luke?

Okay.
- He went fishing.

Yeah.
He didn't catch anything though.

That's a common fishing blunder.
So he's good?
"Yeah, he's good."
I can tell him hello for you if you want.
Whatever.
Thank you.
- My God.
This is really good.
- I'm glad you like it.
"- So, how much time you got?"
- I got a bit.
There's a record store you should check out.
It's run by this insane freak who's a walking encyclopedia... for every punk and garage band record ever made.
Catalog numbers.
He's crazy.
The place is right out of High Fidelity.
- Let's go.
Should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24.
24!
- 24.
- Are you done?
"Sorry, let's do this."

"That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning."
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three!
Three.
"Three, tres, three."
- Hello.
- Sorry.
Just remind me.
"All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer."
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
Wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
- Thank you very much.
- Not you.
The Lotto girl.
You'll thank me later!
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.

The reservation is under Elise Lacey.
Oh.
Hi.
Your date's waiting for you.
Follow me.
"Oh, really?"
Is he normal?
- I wouldn't exactly say normal.
- Really?
You must be Kitty.
That's very good.
Thanks.
"I'll be back to tell you about specials in a minute, senator."
Thank you.
I never would've figured you for a silent treatment type.
I'm not giving you silent treatment.
I'm considering how I can tell you off without losing my job.
- You're angry.
- Yes!
Yes.
"It's OK, polo."
There.
"feels good, huh?"
Yes... yes...
What's going on?
"Nothing, I got caught in his headphones."
He often screams like that.
"I was washing him, the headphones fell, he couldn't hear the music."
Seeing lots of strangers makes him yell... or losing his play farm figures.
What happened?
- He fell in the bailer.
- baller?
- The thing that makes balls of hay.
- I know.
He fell in one when he was small.
You've known him long?
always been neighbors.
We played together as kids.

I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
And souls don't die.
Soul?

"Helene, we have a guest."
- Wanna play football?
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming yesterday.
- My pleasure.
- Can we offer you something?
- No.
"Helene, can we talk?"
- I was going to call.
- But you didn't.
Do you have a minute?
Of course.
Yes.
- Let's go out to the kitchen.
- Good idea.
Let's go to the kitchen.
- Or would you rather be alone?
"- No, I'd like you to come."
"Boys, stay with Anna and grandmother."
"- Jørgen, is everything okay?"
"- Yes, unpack your presents."
All this running to and fro.
You old grump...
- Did you lose again?
- Yes.
Don't come here like this.
You should have waited for me to call you.
- You didn't call.

"We couldn't have known how important, ...that summer would turn out to be."
Until that day...
"Hey, wait up!"
"Toshi, slow down."
I'm the boss.
Slaves follow!
That's not fair!
Don't run.
Watch out for gopher holes!
I still can't believe it.
"Shut up, will you?"
"Fell right in, and bumped your head."
Weren't you gonna warn me?
No!
"You saw us jump, yeah?"
You should've figured it out.
"Let's finish this, ...or we'll miss the campfire."
What's that?
"Toshi, wait!"
- He's always like this.
- Don't leave us!
Ouch.
Yusuki?
Misaki?
You scared me.
Kuya!
Wait!
That's just the remains of a previous experiment.
It's not someone you should be fighting.
"Hey, lemme know, if you're gonna be reckless like that!"
No way!
I see...
But remember the Von Dinosaur incident...
Proceed with extreme caution.
"Yes, of course."
"If you'll excuse me, sir."
"Now, we're fully prepared..."
"The world will now see the almighty power of the States, and realize who will lead the world!"
Is it going to take her away?
Cover her!
I won't allow you to take Manami!
Damn...
"Take me, too!"
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
No...!
Wh...
What?
Kuya!
You okay?
Yes...
Let's get the hell out of here!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Not at all.
"The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark."
It can bruise a little.
Cupping?
"Yes, ancient Chinese secret."
All the celebrities do it.
"It draws out toxins, boosts metabolism."
You'll feel good.
[ Exhales deeply ] Who knew?
[ Yawns ]
"Oh, excuse me."
It's just so relaxing in here.
It's the aromatherapy.
The lavender really packs a punch.
Huh.
Ahh.
Geez.
That's wa-a-a-rm.
[ Snores ]
[ Snoring ]
[ Slurping ]
Flojo.
"You got time to lean, you got time to clean, huh?"
I'm starving.
What do we get to eat?
Same as the clients.
They expect us to eat this rabbit food?
It's not rabbit food.
It's super food.
I'm not eating it.
[ Sighs ]
"At Canyon Valley, we're supposed to lead by example."
That's it.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah.
Daddy's funny that way.
Between the smokin' can and
"The street hockey take, we got"
Almost 2 grand here.
It's unbelievable.
"Why don't we call a truce, OK?"
"We all quit smoking anyway, so"
Why don't we call a truce and
Buy something we really need.
New ipod.
How about a boom box.
"Come on, a new microwave."
"That oven is so old, it's"
Leaking microwaves when it's not
Even on.
Pretty soon we're all gonna be
Growing an extra cock and a pair
Of tits.
"Look at me, come on."
I'm halfway there.
"An ipod can hold 35,000"
Songs.
"35,000 puerto rican"
Hip-Hop songs.
Hey.
Will you please get me a
"Little garlic out of the fridge,"
"Too, please?"
Batting cage.
"Hey, buddy."
This place has gone totally downhill.
"Hey, buddy, where'd you come from?"
"I saw you inside, raising hell."
"Yeah, that chump took my backpack!"
"So, Natasha..."
Yeah.
"Man, what about her?"
Have you seen her?
"Long gone, bro."
She hasn't danced here in months.
You know where she is?
"Last time I saw you, you wanted to punch my face in."
You remember that?
- Vaguely.
- It was that chick.
Zoe.
- Out of the picture?
- Out of the picture.
- You got blow?
"- No, man."
Why would I have blow?
Natasha...
Got a couple ideas where she might be.
There he is!
"Welcome back, Conner!"
- Ah!
"That really does hurt, man!"
- Chemical burns will do that.
Not too serious.
Looks like the EMTs did a good job irrigating.
That ambulance guy brought my camera?
"- with $20,000..."
- Wait.
Wait.
"Seriously, wait."
Wait.
Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
We can... we can fence them and then we have the money.
We can do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you... you want to steal the watches to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything...
I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
(Rhythmic crashes)
(Growling)
(Thunderous footsteps approaching)
(Grunts)
(Growling and thrashing)
"Oh, damn it."
Oi!
Hey!
You big git!
(Growls softly)
Call yourself an eligible suitor for our fair Griselda?
You're a vagrant!
"Hold him, Madge."
Hold him!
You leave her alone.
Leave her alone.
Go on!
"Someone at the door, dear."
- We must make up our minds.
- Gentlemen!
- We can't delay.
- Let's do something.
This king's champion must be stopped.
The monster must be protected.
"If he kills the monster, we'll all be ruined."
Let me prevail upon you.
No more argy-bargy is necessary because I have a plan.
Behold!
The Black Knight.
Wonderful!
We must be getting closer.
Grease.
Grease.
Now that.
Get him.
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
"Come to my arms, my beamish boy"
"- Oh, frabjous day!"
- The monster's dead!
The monster's dead!
Stop!
No one's to enter the city unless they have money.
The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.
Found it.
Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!
What the...?
Are you a moron?
That's evidence.
"He should've wrapped it in cloth or something, right?"
Gokseong Police Station
"So, she killed everyone?"
That's what they said.
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
YOu!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
HOW did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
You're late.
The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show.
I'll be happy to disappoint them.
- Sweetie?
- Yes sir.
- Stay close.
- Thanks.
See you later. 9:00.
Red eleven.
I'm approaching the cabin.
It's 5250.
Angels?
The signal's jammed.
Somebody doesn't want us listening.
Angels?
You're cutting it a little close.
I'm not here for the company.
I'm here to place my bid.
Are you sure your employer's prepared
- ...to compete in the big leagues?
- You'll see.
Welcome.
Business is for tomorrow.
Tonight...
A toast.
To the most beautiful flower in the world.
Salud.
Na zdorovie.
None of you have met my boss...
But he's successful because he's risk-averse.
That's why you all have been drugged.
The first thing to go is muscle control.
Honey...
- jeffrey.
"- Hey,darling."
- You're home early.
- Is that a problem?
- No
- No?
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
"Oh,my."
They're gorgeous.
But why?
Tonight is your night.
You're going to be hearing a lot of speeches from people and...
I'm not going to bore you with one of my own.
I'm just...very proud of you.
"Jeff,there's something I need to tell you."
- sara.
- Hi.
"Senator,we still have to meet with the governor's people."
And security's now requested we arrive an hour earlier.
Thank you.
You should get ready.
Was there something...?
No.
"Later,when it's,um... when it's just us."
All right.
Shall we?
Okay.
"Don't reference the early readers program, at least 15 people in this room voted against it."

All battleships fire at the robot!
Now!
"Now, damn it, now!"
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!
"Not everything, General."
The bomb.
The Nautilus has first strike capability and is not far offshore.
"You scare me, Mansley."
You want us to bomb ourselves in order to kill it?
"General, the giant seems to follow whatever attacks it."
"We can lure it away from the town, then destroy it."
Radio the Nautilus.
Come along.
"Chop-CF"")?"
Big Sally.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Eh...
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Right, private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."

Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
"- Nefedov, where does all this bounty come from?"
-We are strengthening ties with the locals!

What's wrong?
What's up?
Why are you crying?
Why are you all crying?
Why is everybody crying?
"The carrot is very bitter, it needs some sweeties!"
Bitter!
You're not the one who disappeared.
You would've had to have been there in the first place.
"No, not Artie."
"Oh, all your--all your secrets,"
"And your--and your treasure hunts,"
And that damned place.
"You know, James believed in life."
You need to get one.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Carol.
Carol.
Carol.
Could you please--please.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What?
- Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
"Human stuff, huh?"
"Hey, let me see."
Oh!
Oh!
Look at this.
Wow.
This is special.
"This is very, very unusual."
- What?
What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See?
Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
"- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt."
- [Both] Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
"So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music."
Allow me.
- [Scuttle coughs]
- Music!
- It's stuck!
"- Oh, the concert!"
"Oh, my gosh!"
My father's gonna kill me!
"Please God, don't."
Don't fucking take me out.
Please don't.
Please don't take me out.
-It's okay.
-Please don't.
I'm not feeling that.
What's up with the gallop?
The tempo's shit.
-I'm right.
Right?
"-Yep, tempo's shit."
"No, no, no, no."
Let us get into it.
It's gonna have texture.
"Like, you know, like ooze."
Sonic ooze.
Great.
Sonic ooze.
"Okay, baby, how about a horn section?"
"A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?"
I heard Herb's in town.
-Let's not get patronizing.
-That's not patronizing.
That was accommodating.
I was accommodating you.
"Against my better judgment, even."
"-Sweet, that's it."
That's the direction.
-I've overplayed it.
No.
We just gotta straighten out the beat.
Look at this.
Look at this here.
[Whimpering]
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Grunting]
INTERVIEWER:
Damn.
[Chatter]
OK.
Here's what's happening right now.
We are locked with camera.
The stuntman is prepping.
"OK, we need some nice, respectful silence"
While we do this work.
And then we're gonna light him on fire.
[Whistle] Safety guy up here.
INTERVIEWER:
What do you think about this next stunt?
"Every time I've done these, they've been really horrible,"
So-- INTERVIEWER:
They have?
TRENT HAAGA:
"Yeah, I'm not really optimistic."
"But, you know, we'll see."
Want to make a dollar bet?
We'll make a dollar bet.
INTERVIEWER:
"OK, I'll make you a dollar."
All right.
I'll make a dollar bet saying that this sucks.
Special concerns concerning the stairs that he
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
And then seafood.
Promise.
Seafood before we go home.
Get out!
Get out!
Go!
Go!
The man in the elevator!
Help!
Please help!
Help me!
Don't hurt me!
The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.
He would not give them to anybody.
Stay with me.
You'll be safe.
"Come on, let's go."
My God!
Let's go.
Come on.
They've checked the entire floor.
There's no one in there.
"No body, nothing."
"The secretary said a Russian guy showed up, asked her boss a lot of questions."
Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.
"The next thing she knew, the place was on fire."
Have you gone through every place of debris in the office?
- We'll keep looking.
- Good.
He was adopted by a Russian family.
Sir...
I saw every Inspector Chamforth picture there ever was.
Just used to go right back and watch them again.
Oh!
"You see, someone has made a mistake."
A simple mistake that could be easy to miss.
Yes!
Oh!
"Sir, I need to wire my mom."
There's our secret weapon.
Now you write him in.
No excuses and no bar bills.
God bless America.
God bless America.
"Well, he's very handsome."
Oh!
Cmon!
So what's an American doing in Dunkirk?
No.
Scrub that.
What isn't he doing?
Fighting.
Yeah.
So what does that make him?
Appeased?
Now we need a hero.
"I don't know, umm...travel writer...journalist?"
Journalist!
Hard boiled wise cracking Yankee hack who compile it to both heroically.
No.
You're not pinching any more action from Rose and Lily.
I'm...
- Jean-Claude?
- What?
I don't have a hard-on!
So what?
Me neither.
In whose honor should we get it up?
I always wake up with one.
You're probably too filthy...
There's so much dirt id take a bulldozer to dig it out.
Come on.
It feels great...
I can't.
I'll start bleeding again.
"Well, how about your feet?"
We could clean them up a bit.
Purify the air...
You'll be all right...
Stop worrying.
Is all in your head and you're getting obsessed...
"Feels good, huh?"
Feel any lighter?
You're real pretty!
You're almost desirable...
Hands off!
What hands?
"Yours, faggot!"
Don't be ashamed...
I'm not ashamed.
I just don't want to.
I don't want to...
How do you know?
If you've never tried it?
Nothing will happen to your aunty.
"Take care, Sheen."
Take care!
Shedab has got to know that you and Sheen are together.
He has got your mobile traced.
It's not safe for you to be there now.
Move out immediately!
"We have to move, Immediately!"
Come on!
Come!
Come!
"Come sir, vehicle is ready, sir!"
Move!
Movie inside!
"Be seated, sir."
"Sir, it seems you are new to this city."
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
We are just going on an outing.
Going to Nainital.
The vehicle has broken down.
And it will take 2 to 3 days.
"So, don't know about the train."
"So we thought of going by bus, from the highway."
Very good!
Enjoy yourselves.
It's your age.
Enjoy yourselves.
Live life.
What about us?
We are old now.
How much?
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"
Do you still want to see the rest?
Yes.
That'll be a bit difficult  without hands.
I'm listening.

Addons So ...
What kind of lover you are?
Yes ...
Let us know!
Addons
- Repeat the question.
"- No, that's good."
"I say that the test is the mistress, sadist."
I know.
That's why I was good.
But that stupid test.
I make time to go.
The test was wrong?
Is not it?
Well ...
"I'm not sadistic, implies that if."
"Your answer was given to Addons and results, but lying a few questions, right?"
I do not know ...
"I have not taken seriously, to be honest."
Addons This is a question to the 4 ...
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!

Are you going to come in?

It is forbidden.
No way!

There is no water inside it.
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
"Sharon, the intern."
"Hello, who is this?"
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me?
Jealous?
Are you mad?

Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
Towards a dawn the situation was even badder unfortunately.
It was silence however on the next night.
"A little sawing was heard, they did not pay attention to him."
Nothing disturbed their dream on this night.
Approximately until midnight.
Mariska.
Mariska!
Ágika!
To get dressed!
Awake.
We are ready!
"Need some help, Tót?"
Are you able to carry it alone?
My God.
Beautiful.
And how works?
"You notice it immediately, Ágika."
First...we begin it with 5 cardboard.
"- Mariska,come."
"- I'm coming, major lord."
We start it then.
"And now, listen."
"Oh, what you say to him, ...what?"
"- Dear Jézus, what a machine."
- Wonderful.
Simply wonderful.
And...notis needed scissors.
Look here!
Christ!
"- Cuts it so, even the cheese."
- Well I was not able to imagine one like this.
"You know, how much there are now in him?"

Well...
What do you know?
Don't you feel stupid?
Dangerous characters.
"Not bad, huh?"
You can't get any?
Like a little feel?
Hands up.
And fast!
"Tough luck, boys."
I'm trying out my new gun.
Is my third car stolen this year.
I'm a little fed up.
Get it?
We didn't steal it.
We just borrowed it.
"We returned it, didn't we?"
Here it is.
It never even moved.
Tell that to the cops.
Go call them.
"No, wait!"
Why bother the cops?
We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time like we were hitch-hiking and you picked us up.
You weren't around.
"You have 45 seconds, two passes, you're looking for waterfalls."

You can pass.
Is that...?
Pass.

No passes left. 15 seconds.
Time up.
"Well, that was quite hard for you guys?"
Yeah.
So what you got for one point was Dettifoss.
In Iceland.
"According to myth, created by the hoof of Odin's eight-legged horse."
What you could have got...
"Victoria Falls, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe."
"And Iguazu, located on the border of Brazil and Argentina."
At the end of that you scored one point.
"Lutrophiles, you're on 11, Araucarians are on four."
"Team Araucarians, we have two topics left, which will you choose?"
Well...
Music is iffy.
SO not our thing!
"Neither is Food and Drink, really."
Let's go.
"Marshal, please."
What kind of place is this?
This is a high class brothel.
A brothel?
What do you take me for?
The moral standard is down the drain...
What a lovely bottom!
What a surprise!
Take good care of him.
Marshal...
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's stay and check the place out.
There may be underage girls here.
Yes.
Let's have a toss.
Drink up.
Don't be shy.
What's wrong?
You're flushed.
What?
I just had a little drink.
But you just drank the soy sauce.
I want to investigate this girl.
Wait.
What's the matter?
Can I investigate your wife?
Do you know who I am?
- And do you know who I am?
- Who are you?
- Liang Foon of the Pochilam School.
- I've never heard your name.
You'll never have to do another one...
Promise?

And if she says:

That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Will systems be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
"May I suggest we contact ""C"" Team?"
See about the weather.
- Petersen?

What was all that about ladders and coffins?
"When Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell."
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.

Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."

What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.

We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.

I meant you're not trained to work as part of this team.
There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.

Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.

I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!

You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!
"Marshal, if you need any help, just ask."
No need.
I'm the Marshal of seven provinces!
"When I'm on a case, I can withstand anything!"
"Reporting for duty, Marshal!"
I've arrested all the painted faces.
But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!
- Useless...
- Reporting for duty!
Stop!
Make way!
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing?
Possible.
After my careful analysis...
Possible?
No way.
"Excellent judgement, Marshal."
I traveled far for White Tiger.
So I leave this insignificant case to you.
I'll hold you responsible for your fail this.
Responsible?
Me?
Marshal!
You've come such a long way.
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.
Please...
We weren't invited to the restaurant's opening.
Why?
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.
Huang?
It's his birthday a couple days later.
Send him a birthday suit.
He'll like my suit for sure.
Is everything ready for my birthday?
"Everything is ready, Master."
Master...
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.
What?
Your birthday suit.
Show him in.
How come it's different tailor?
Ah To's away.
Let me take your measurement.
Fine.
I know.
But nothing appears to be wrong with the thermostat.
And I couldn't find anything wrong with the lights and the TV either.
Okay.
So what is it?

Not you too.

"Oh, with flying colors."
I'm not supposed to reveal that until the official report is issued.
It'll be our little secret.
[Chuckles]
"Okay, so..."
Just...
Just one more thing.
What's that?
"Um, I was wondering if you might have dinner with me some evening?"
"Oh, Mr. Ackerman."
"Oh, no."
"Call meJerry, please."
Jerry.
Master!
Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!
Execute him for the murder of his master.
"Your Highness, Law Ching has cheated you."
His student definitely knows 8-divine Sword.
Arrest him!
8-divine Sword?
Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
Mr. Yagami?
We were in the same class.
But we did not go.
"I saw him yesterday, to my work."
He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.

"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.
No...
No...

- Huh?
- It was a night protection.
"Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
Look what you've done.
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- Sickle!
Go back!
Sickle!
No!
Letha...
look.
- I can't look.
- You must.
It's miraculous.
"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."
It... must be that... boy.
There's a...
There's a force that centers around that boy.
A force capable of countermanding the basic physical law of...
gravity.
"Victor, I don't know what you're talking about."
Molecular mobilization.
"I need that boy, Letha."
- I need him desperately.
"- Now, just a minute."
"Brilliant, my boy."
"Yes, 'tell'."
Let's say 'tell'.
- Tell 'Tell'.
It's a great sauce.
This is mayonnaise.
This is vinaigrette with...
With garlic.
- Oh yes.
And this is 'Iyutenitsa'.
"It looks like ketchup, but it's natural."
Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.
Let's go home.

"Ludovic, we have to stop shooting right away."

On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.
Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.

The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.

"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."

But you haven't won anything.
"On your knees, Captain!"
No!
Does it still taste as sweet?
I order you.

- In the interrogation room.
- Heard .
You too I buterai you.
You will see
"I'll have your skin too, you'll see"
- You heard.?
You'll see!
- Mr. Yagami .
The hospital contacted us
Your wife goes wrong dot
Let us do.
Go to her .
"No, Otoharada priority."
I will go to the hospital after .
Why are you not come immediately
"You've been called many times, why not come to you?"
Mom!
!
Mom
- Dad!
[LAUGHING]
- So you still wanna have coffee?
- Absolutely.
"Oh, great."
"Okay, I really will stop gushing in a minute."
But when we walked out into that parking lot and I saw that you drive a Prius too...
[LAUGHS]
- I almost wept.
- I know.
I'm not alone anymore.
Oh!
"I didn't ask you, though."
"Are you married, or?"
Mm.
Divorced.
Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic!
My marriage was a miserable failure too.
No.
"No, actually we're still really good friends."
Yes.
I'm still really good friends with my ex-husband.
- You're kidding.
"- No, I am not."
- We are the exact same person.
- I know.
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever let your armpit hair grow out just to see how long it'll get?
Eww.
No.
Do you?
No.
AKAN:
"Memories, memories, memories."
My first batch of cyber soldiers.
"With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on."
"I love you, Charlie."
"I love you, Edward."
"I love you, Thomas."
You recognize these?
No?
That's odd.
They're your wife's.
(SNIFFING)
Mmm...
I smell what you like about her.
(BEEPING)
This one is almost ready for you.
"But I'm warning you, their boosters make the one you have in you now..."
Look like a fucking 9-volt.
Go ahead and fuck him up.

* You got the epic mother... *
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
* You got the epic mother... *
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
No idea.
The murderer would be dead inside .
The police officer has not received the shot the killer allegedly shot because of pain .
We repeat
The murderer...
So...
It was a real...
Dad!
I'm fine.
Where is Light?
Party somewhere.
We can not count on him.
How it is possible...
I would have preferred to live .
without knowing such a thing
I killed
2 persons...
Me?
Sorry.
Papa.
You want to die?
I am the former owner of the Death Note .
I am the God of Ryuk death.
Do not be so surprised.
"From now on, you had to understand that it is not a simple notebook?"
How does it feel to kill?
Shit!
Papa.
Sayu.
Farewell.
You do not want this notebook ?
My presence does not mean that you will soon die.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"On deck, Mr. Pardoe!"
Mr. Crawford!
Mr. Crawford!
- Find the senior midshipman for me.
"- Mr. Kilpatrick, sir?"
- Tell him to see me in the gunroom.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get that hatch open.
Let some air into the magazine.
Did you hear what I said?
Open that hatch.
"But we had it open yesterday, sir."
I don't care if it was.
I'm giving you an order.
Open that hatch!
- Orders is weekly.
"- Stand, you insolent dog!"
Mr. Kilpatrick?
Mr. Scott-Padget wants to see you.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
He said now.
- Get that hatch open at once.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Sergeant Kneebone."
- Three more.
- I've got seven.
- Only five.
- Good enough.
"Only a few more, and we'll have the whole ship."
"- Now, we write our petition."
Cross over those territories in such an unstable period
Is definitely out of the question.
Why never?
Because they are the Balkans.
So?
I said the Balkans.
- Yes and then?
Unstable.
Unstable.
"There is Bulgaria, Serbia..."
"Romania, Albania, Macedonia..."
Excuse me.
- His Majesty.
Excuse me.
We'll have a meeting.
We will return.
- All right.
She must understand...
- Sire.
Wait a moment.
We have to find a solution.
"It is not possible, Your Majesty."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Mr Lloyd, not now."
I try to speak with Turkish security and Mr. Bulut.
Maybe even with the ambassador.
I'm going to take the luggage.
"Sire, I see if there's a field above."
Excuse me.
Where is the Ambassador?
"One time, I documented wars and revolutions."
"Then I drank for a decade, persecuted by nightmares."
That looks like an industrial park.
"Well, it was, but now it's slated for demolition."
I'll call Booth.
(glass breaks)
BOOTH:
Looks like this is where he set up shop.
Look at all this stuff.
Booth?
Yeah?
Look at this.
There's parish records.
News clippings about Aldo.
Discharge documents...
This X-ray is not Aldo's.
It's of somebody else.
How do you know?
There's a stellate-shaped wound directly above the right squamosal suture.
Gunshot?
Yes.
The extent of the damage indicates a high powered rifle.
Perfectly placed.
Not too many people can make that shot.
BRENNAN:
The writing is Cyrillic.
Serbian.
That is correct.
Where are you going?
Over here.
Going behind door number two.
Look at this.
This is not good.
(clears throat)
Oi!
They're going down the science block.
Come back!
Halls of residence.
Shall we?
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
We're seeking shelter from the fascist oppressors.
And we're wet.
Can I interest you in some hashish?
I'm not really supposed to.
Drugs do odd things to me at the moment.
Aren't they supposed to?
This is Matt.
You want a hit from the bong?
He is an artist.
"Truly, an artist."
I'm Toby.
His roommate.
"And this is of the purest, highest possible grade."
I assure you.
Cool!
Bravo!
All splendid fun.
Polly!
My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?
"I'm going to pretend that I don't smell that, Toby."
"Smell what, mon petit chou?"
"It's very, very naughty what you're doing, Toby."
Quite possibly.
Anyway.
[Breathes deeply]
"Well, I try really fucking hard."
- [Laughs]
- So I'm glad you noticed.
[Sighs]
"So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?"
Hmm.
"No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out."
[Gasps]
- Yeah.
- Mnh-mnh.
"- Yes, you did."
"- No, trust me."
"If I was fucking freaking out, the police would be notified, helicopters would be deployed."
We'd have hounds released.
"Well, can we at least be on the news?"
News?
"Baby, it would be the top fucking story."
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
I need a drink.
You want one?
You know I can't have a drink.
Don't tempt me with that.
"It's empty calories, you little sorceress vixen."
[Laughs] You're a woman!
"Yeah, a woman you just fucked."
[Sighs]
I'll be right back.
[Sighs]
[Cellphone buzzes]
[Sighs]
We are going to the hunting lodge
Bali Bey what are we waiting for?
Let's have a walk.
My legs are asleep
Let's wait a little bit more.
Maybe she'll come
Who will come?
There she is
Wait for me
You...
Are you following me?
Not a bit.
Why would I follow?
I'm not following
My gut tells me that there's a valuable jewellery here
Right Matrakçı?
Or are my eyes misguiding me?
Are not those the most beautiful eyes in the world?
"Nasuf Efend, Welcome Efendi"
Here my father.

Your daughter?
Yes sir.

He wants to buy somethings
Really?
Anything you desire sir
Sorry.

You do that.
-Wanna hear my latest theory?
-Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
-Long-term tactical formations.
-Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
EMERSON:
Could be.
"-lt's good, right?"
-Yeah.
katherine:
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
-EMERSON:
That's nice.
"-Ah, give me something."
EMERSON:
We're up two hours early next shift.
-You guys been waiting long?
"-No, you're good."
-Good shift?
-EMERSON:
Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
It was nice.

Sonakshi I really liked that you attended the party.

It's on me.
Get a life.
I've got yours.
It's quite enough.
You read this?

I didn't appoint him.
He was nominated like everybody else.
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours...
... andI alwayswillbe.
But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves...
-... andWalterStern.
-Distance is shit.
Distance!
Distance is something you do to your enemies.
It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct.

Serious?
Let's go eat where you work.
"Okay, but not seeking discounts."
- You guessed it?
- Obviously.
"Yagami, you want to become official?"
It's not my concern more than that.
"You got the ambition, right?"
I know not you can become rich.
Ambition is not everything.

Poscher?
Dead.
The 3rd Hiromitsu?
Stolen.
And Maya?
Disappeared without a trace.
What?
But her apartment was under constant surveillance.
"They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left."
"She was gone, when the replacement came."
I don't get it.
Why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either.
Until this arrived.
What is it?
The Hiromitsu file.
It took our colleagues in NewYork sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
"As it turns out, he didn't commitsuicide"
I just invented him.
What are you?
A clerk?
- Keep silence!
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, I'm promised to study law."
"Very well, Mr. Dawlish."

When guards are vulnerable.
It's not like we're liberating the whole camp anyway.
"Assuming we can get them out, there'll be search parties."
They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.

I've never once thought of you as a monster!
Then why didn't you tell me about your family?

I hear your family was murdered by a Methuselah.
And that you dirtied your own hands exacting revenge on him!

And I've got the music.

"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths,"
I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now.
You're going to flip out.

Oh... dear...

He would speak for you?
How well do you know him?
- Intimately.
Often.
- You visit him?
"You claim that, do you?"
Do you also claim to be a madman?
- To visit someone who doesn't exist...
- Not exist?

Well...
Let's go!
Please enter on the collapsed tunnel.
In about 500 meters there's the place we are searching for.
"Ram, don't run."
"Male, pay attention to your steps."
Yes.
"Lieutenant, what happened?"
Don't worry.
Male stepped over a landmine.
Really?
In a place like that?
You are not scared.
Aren't you?
Leave me alone...
"Lieutenant, be careful please."
Right now a heat source has become visible.
Ok!
Let's change location.
"Everyone, listen!"
There is something lurking in the ruins at the west.
It's not like they are unarmed people.
We will take a walk before exploring underground.
Let's start the procedure as usual.
Launch the UAV.
The enemy is already moving.
Hurry!
Arrest me!
I'm asking for police custody!
I'm a criminal!
Arrest me!

- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.

"- No, sir."
I wouldn't have.

You think that'll work in German?
We'll drop hundreds of these on the guys in the trenches.

What makes the malaysian rainforest promising

In the town of Hamelin Many years ago
The citizens were crying out A tearful tale of woe
"""Rats, rats, rats!"
They chase the dogs And kill the cats
"Rats, rats, rats!"
"They build their nest In our Sunday hats"""
The citizens of Hamelin
Were frantic with despair
They gnashed their teeth And stamped their feet
And shouted to the mayor
"""Rats, rats, rats!"""
"The people cried ""We've gotta get rid of the rats"
"Gotta get rid of the rats In Hamelin town"""
Rats!
Rats!

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
For the middle of nowhere.
You ready?
Come on.
Hey there.
"Hey, we're looking for, um,"
Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you?
"That's ok, we can come back."
"I'm sorry, but you look so familiar."
"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.
Jimmy!
Hey!
What's the reason of my friend's worry?
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
I've gone mad today.
Many girls came in my life and I forgot them.
But this one has impressed me.
Wow!
"Excuse me, Jaikishan!"
- Mr. Berry!
Senior sir has come from Delhi.
Hello!
"- Sir, he's Jaikishan!"
I had told you about him.
Oh!
Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.
"In a short time, you became a hero of our company."
I read your suggestions about Rajdoot motorcycle
I liked it.
- Thank you very much.
"So, mister."
"You got promotion, right?"
I never say anything wrong.
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
She has gone to visit a motorbike factory... ...with her Jimmy.

Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.
- Yun?
"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?

None
Everything was wonderful.
I think the MV will come out well.
These shoes are too heavy I can't wear them.
"Ah, so heavy."
"Hey, seriously... stop that!"
You look scared for sure right now.
Take one hand off!
- I can't.
- It doesn't look good.
"Look here, kid."
You have to stand up straight.
Don't do that.
This is really dangerous. or you can do this.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
"Ah, my back."
Shall we go?
"Good, really good."
I think I can do it now.
That's a wrap!
Great job.
Great job.
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!
Sleep!

No need to look so depressed.. ..you won't get an off.
Get that.
Just one idol left!
"By the way, where's the trip headed?"
I can't believe you're coming with us.
The children are so happy.
She thinks you are crazy.
"I am going on a visit to the temple. - "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
""" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
Where is he?
- A dozen of pot-bellied Ganesh idols.
- What!
Those Krishnas worth 250.
Eight of those brawny Hanumans.
- What are you saying?
- And five of those 'Sherawali'.
The lady sitting on the tiger.
What's the total?
"Three dozen, sir."
"- Three dozen, right!"
"Then, three Sai Babas bonus."
- What?
They are in a big demand.
Send it to the white Volvo parked there.
"- Okay. "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
What did you give him?
Give me too.
"- Funny, people are distributing alcohol like offerings.."
What's that?
What should I say?
Never...
I'm a thief.
A goon... a criminal.
I can commit any crime but not this.
Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.
Or was it Russ you really wanted?
30 seconds!
Where's Jessica?
"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!
No time to proof them.
I'll just have to trust you.
"Now, go, all right?"
"We're live, remember?"
"5, 4, 3, 2..."
"Hello, I'm Jessica Fakewiel..."
Wakefield... with the *Oracle On-Air News.*
"So, here we are... our first live broadcast."
This doesn't look good.
"Oh, the news."
"Well, a lot has happened this week."
Bunches.
"And now... with details, my sister Elizabeth."
I should've known.
Go get 'em.
"(Patty) Manny, pick up Liz as she comes in."
"Thank you, Jessica."
Anytime.
"Good morning, Sweet Valley."
Today's top story...
Missing school fund discovered after a recent probe into the school department budget...
We should talk.
"Winston, it still says ""Jessica."""
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me.
Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Fire!
"Fire!"""
"Kinda defeats the purpose, right?"
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
"I didn't say ""Fire!"", I said ""Fuck!"""
Fuck!
Fuck-fire!
Fuck!

Ass!
You can say anything.
Shit!
Bitch!
Cunt!
Fuck!
Fart!
Fuck!
"Wow, I just shot down a duck by saying ""Fuck!"""
Next is the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker.
This thing is the biggest shit-biscuit I've ever seen.
"You stand on it, and supposedly, you rock back and forth, which controls the D-pad."
The modern-day equivalent would be the Wii Fit.
"The Roll &amp;amp; Rocker is supposed to be compatible with every game for the NES, but I find that it isn't compatible with any of 'em."
"Each game responds differently, but none of them work."
"Adventure Island keeps walking right,"
"Excitebike keeps going down,"
"Skate or Die goes in circles,"
"Kung Fu ducks to the right,"
"Metal Gear does nothing at all,"
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
"From the land of Mathura, where else?"
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.
Glory to you.
As long as people believe in toys like this.. ..our business will prosper.
Kanji.
"This is the God's idol, don't call it a toy."
The Lord is only a delusion.
"- Yes, let's go."
lsn't that Chintu?
Yes.
"Yes, that's him."
- Yes.
Yes.
He's dancing so well.
I'll put an end to all this.
Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."
Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj.
Water of Ganges.
"- Yes, yes."
"Oh, give me some."
Why is it so bitter?
Because the Ganges is polluted.
Oh!

Apologise.
They were fasting.
Hello.
- We were fasting.
And you gave us alcohol.
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.
It's made from sugarcane.
"It fills you with energy, and makes you lightheaded."
- Rascal.
Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.
Abusing in the month of 'Shravan' (pious month).
See.
Truth sounds bitter than liquor.
There's a limit to cracking jokes.
"Papa, please."
"What you did yesterday, is a sin in mummy's view."
And mummy's fasting today to repent for it.
I want to know.
How can she repent for my sins by fasting?
"Sushila, it's like your phone's on charging.. ..and my battery's getting charged."
ls it Wi-fi?
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
So?
"I see. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Case on God admitted.
"Paper, paper, paper."
High Court has put it's seal on it.
Through the notice prepared by advocate Hanif Qureshi.. ..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case on God has been accepted.
I think he's mad.
Who is this guy?
"Hey Jigna, what happened?"
"See, his wife ran away."
Who can live with that madman?
I don't even talk to him.
Or the Lord might punish us as well.
What a splendid bike.
"- But, who is he?"
I think he arrived just last night.
Who's playing this classical music?
I've heard that the new guest is really handsome.
Don't I look handsome?
Get inside.
"Hey, Hari Prasad."
"Hey, Chaurasiya."
What's all this?
I was waking up the birds!
What?
Who?
I was waking up the birds!
Practice.
I was practising.
It's a good thing to do in the morning.
I should stay out of danger.
Run!
Who are you?
I am a lieutenant of the police!
"If you fear this sword, then move aside!"
"I mean, I'll attack you!"
Halt!
What's this?
Why are you here?
I was worried you'd be in danger!
That you'd be caught!
You'll be in danger if you're with me.
So go back!
What about you?
The police are everywhere!
What if they see a lady from a noble house involved with thieves?
I don't care.
Then do what you want.
I don't care.
Who hit me?
Damn it.
What do I do with you?
It's better for you to be a hostage than a thief.
- Move aside!
- Stand your ground!
Move aside.
"If she gets hurt, we'll all be in trouble."
Miss Eun Hye...?
- Follow him!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Miss Eun Hye...!
Miss Eun Hye!
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
"Hairy is the word that's just, I just picture his forearms, and being like, where are you?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I don't mind that.
BETH HOYT:
"I could, I can French braid."
I'd love to try a fish tail braid on his arm.
That would be fashionable.
"OK, you guys."
We are minutes away from open comments.
Anything you've ever wanted to ask Julie or
"Ted, now is your chance."
Put them in the comments.
We'll be right back.
STEPHEN SElDEL:
Some people work at home.
Other people work at their office.
Matt does his business in the streets.
STEPHEN SElDEL:
Steve.
You're hired.
"Yeah, I need a sandwich."
MALE SPEAKER:

McMayhem.
"What, you didn't know?"
"Naw, he ain't playing."
MATT MCMANUS:
Yeah I'm here now.
"I'm setting up, I'm setting up the office."
I'm going to set up shop right here.
Perfect.
You're just my type.
They aren't like you.
Wasn't that Jae Hee?
"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this?
"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
My son wishes that I would just stay sick.
"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
Because you are the future of Egypt
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
He will be safe with me
"He is Egypt, that is all I've ever lived for!"
And now he must live for you!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
ls Marc Antony alive?
"I do not know, my Queen"
But you have to flee the city
Octavius' army will be here within the hour!
No!
I will wait for my king
Your Majesty... there are documents that have to be destroyed...
Go!
Go!
Have you seen Caesarian?
Where is he?
Have you seen the child?
Where's the child?
Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!
Where's the boy?
"He's not here, by the blessings of lsis"
Not here?
What do you mean?
"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!
[groans]
Ow!
"All right, Old Man Blumpkin's house."
"-Yeah, but be easy on the old guy, okay?"
You know he's got that heart condition.
[gun cocks]
-What are you two turds doing in my house?
-Old Man Blumpkin?
-How can you see us?
Only ghosts can see other ghosts.
"-Duh, a--hole."
I just died.
-Ohh.
"-Wait, what did you just say?"
-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."
-Only ghosts can see other ghosts?
-But then... that means...
-You don't remember... do you?
"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
"-(dispatcher) Uh, please say again."
-I said we have an orange with the hiccups.
-(dispatcher) Oh no!
You're screwed!
"[screams, dial tone]"
-Ugh.
"All right, I'm out of ideas."
-[whimpers]
"-Look, everybody."
The important thing right now is to just remain calm.
-[hiccup]
[all screaming]
"-No, no, no!"
Everybody just shut up!
We're not going to freak out.
-That's easy for [hiccup] you to say.
You don't have an exploding [hiccup] hippo in your tummy.
"-Dude, it's not a hippo."
-It's an exploding hippo.
"-Listen to me, Orange."
Do you want to get rid of your hiccups?
-Duh.
"-Then you have to do exactly what I tell you, okay?"
-Okay.
"-Okay, it's really simple."
All you have to do is take a deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds.
-Okay.
[inhales] -(Pear) What?
"No, that never works."
-[groans]
-I always heard you have to stand on your head and cross your eyes.
-Mmm!
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
It was a wonderful experiment until we burned the church down.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Fair enough.
OK.
Let's talk about collaboration.
"If you could work with anyone in the biz, who would it be?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I would love to work with Tina Fey.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Really?
Wow.
"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:
Audience:
Yes.
AB:
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
SPEAKER 18:
"Dude, we do lock our doors."
"Our house has been broken into a couple times by some people, mainly dudes."
SPEAKER 19:
I've taken self-defense classes.
SPEAKER 16:
"I know how to fight, so I'll kick some ass."
SPEAKER 20:
Good question.
SPEAKER 21:
"Oh, man."
Uh.
SPEAKER 22:
Shoot.
"Uh, I don't know."
SPEAKER 23:
[LAUGHS]
SPEAKER 24:
Have you ever felt like you're in danger of sexual violence?
SPEAKER 25:
"No, I haven't."
No.
SPEAKER 26:
"I mean, I've never really felt at risk."
SPEAKER 27:
Sexual violence?
"Well, I don't know."
It's not really something that I think about a whole lot.
SPEAKER 25:
It's not really something I think about that much.
SPEAKER 21:
"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!
"- Really, sir?"
Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.
- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.
"- I'm coming, abla."
There's a lot of ironing to do as well.
"We'll get all done, abla."
Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.
- Who?
"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""
"""... beloved father of Arda and Tuba..."""
"""... husband of Sevgi Gencerel."""
His funeral will be on this afternoon.
A relative?
"Abla, are you okay?"
To the funeral?
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #16:
"Keep it up, keep it up."
There we go.
Teenager #17:
Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
"What's this, dad?"
What's wrong dad?!
What's this letter?
This is an expulsion letter from school
You skip classes?
"Dad, that was when I was in 7th grade"
Oh
And that was a while ago?
You ditched school?
You failure!
Dad it was a very long time ago
No more allowance! and no more Belila (Egyptian food)
I don't like it
Help me Sameh
I'll go get something from the car
Why don't you be more like Sameh?
Smart and clever and always studying really hard
Thanks dad
"You smoke behind my back, you scum?"
What?
You think I don't know?
I know everything!
Go upstairs so I can shower you
What?!
I'll shower you then I'll help you study
GO
Let's go!
Go where?
He said he's gonna shower us
GO
COME ON KARlM
COME ON
I'm drowning
Go now.
It'd be bad if they returned
Please
I'll cope with you some other day
I don't know what you're up to.
Anyway， you must pay
How much? $200，000?
No， make it $20，000
Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?
She's coming up
Miss， it's late.
Come some other day
You've put on my underpants
You must be crazy
Now I've got the proof
Take them off now
Okay
These are yours.
Take them back
ln fact， it was my fault
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
"Check notes, Photos"
Find Ghajini
Kill him
Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!
- (high-pitched static) (muffled scream)
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."
D:
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.
No!
No!
Manuel!
No!
No!
Manuel!
Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
Theresa:
[scoffs]
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Aah!
[romantic music continues] man:
"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.
woman:
"Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down."
"For example, a woman is supposed to kneel down for a man. man:"
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to show us how you do it? woman:
Yes. man:
"So you greet Moses, like, traditionally."
[Moses speaking native language]
man:
Wow.
Wow.
"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."
"One, two, three..."
"One, two, three..."
Third discharge.
"One, two, three..."
He's gone.
Doctor!
Mom?
"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
I was so freaked out.
"(Finebros) So, do you know what that game was?"
No.
Skinny?
Slim?
"I mean, it said ""Slender"" in the front."
"- ""Slender."""
"- ""Slender."""
"""Slender."""
(Finebros) And how do you know about this game?
- I heard it on YouTube.
- On the Internet.
"Someone was, like, tweeting about it."
"(Finebros) So, have you ever played the game before?"
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
(giggles)
- No.
- No.
"No, and I resisted playing it till this day."
- Yeah.
- It's my third time playing it.
I have played it on my phone once and didn't sleep for two days.
(Finebros) And what is the purpose of the game?
To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
I shouldn't have lent the room to...

Don't miss that elephant.
Gotcha!
My!
It's coming here!
"Hey,this is a real elephant."
Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!
"You are a robot, right?"
Hey!
Come here.
The Little Elephant Pura
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.

"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.

- No.
"- So it's fine, then?"

It's fine.

Take that back.
"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
[laughs]

It sounds so funny when you hiccup.

"From the top, from the top, here we go."
-(director) Action!
-It's [hiccup] not...
So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
If you can't trust your wife that much then go live happily by yourself.
What do you mean who?
"It's my friend, Misook."
Here check for yourself.
Hear that?
Bye!
Oh my god.
It flipped over.
"Uh, What happened?"
How old is your kid?!
- Eight!
- How old?!
First grade?
-You met him through the Internet.?
- He was closer than my husband...
I wasn't sure who my real husband was.
I'd get so confused...
You lived in a total illusion.
"Anyhow, love is an illusion!"
"You liked him so much that he felt burdened, right?"
Or Are you...maybe a perv?
Do you like to hit?
Or like to be hit?
Maybe to be bounded?
"- Um, isn't that the College guy?"
"- Uh, it is..."
Hey!
Hey!
College Student!
Are you just gonna ignore us?
Why would I ignore you?
I'm so tired I can't even see.
Maniac.
"I want to see whoever is responsible for the maintenance of this elevator, in my room."
And call the firm and tell them about this scandal.
Güney Bey has a guest.
Simay Canay.
He is mentally challenged.
He's obsessed.
You heard him.
How he threatened me.
He is very determined to get me in trouble.
Güney Bey...
You have a guest waiting at the reception.
- Simay Canay...
- No way.
Tell them to send her away.
How many times I have to tell you not to let that woman in this building?
You still asking?
He doesn't want to see her.
Güney Bey isn't in the company.
His car is here though.
This is what they told me.
I was going to give him something that belongs to him.
"Anyway, as he wishes."
Simay.
Do you have time?
"Mom, I'm home."
Welcome.
The house is smelling wonderful.
Mom?
"What happened, are you okay?"

Vodka!

- Thanks very much.
Go now.
- Anybody been to see her?
- Not a soul.
- Did she go out?
- No.
"If anything happens, I'll skin you alive."
She makes out to be innocent.
But I know she's connected with them.
They'll show up any day now.

Lisa， I didn't want to tell you
When I was a child.

I pitied him and lifted him up
He was so hungry he bit off my teat abruptly
The left one is artificial
And you?
The right one， not the left
Wrong， the left side
Right side

"That is called Hapki Dance, isn't it good?"
Sit down.
"Ah, yes."
"As I was sleeping yesterday, I suddenly had an inspiration!"
"So, I came early because I wanted to complete the choreography."
I could make it big like this as a choreographer.

How about Ann?
AW:
I don't have much to add.
"It was very beautiful and the song was called ""Natural Woman"" and I thought that you really was one."
D:
So lovely
D:
"The jury agreed, Camilla, and what do you think the policeman over there think?"
CL:
"He thinks that everything I do is fantastic, so he just got another confirmation now."
D:
Do you know what I believe?
I think that the cop thought it was touching.
D:
Thanks to the jury.
Thank you so much Camilla and Kristjan.
J:
"Camilla, this is almost like a dream."
What great praise you got from the jury.
CL:
I was very tearful.
J:
Is that true?
CL:
"It's so much energy that has been used now for many weeks, and finally it went my way."

Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:

Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.
"Neither I can move about freely, nor can I sing."
And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
Om!
Om!
Om!
Mother!
Mother!
"What happened, mother?"
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!

"For the last three years, I've been away from home to do my degree."
"And as soon as that finished,"
I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.
So I don't really get to see my old man that much.
"But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up."
man:

Jack:
"Yeah, I just got it, actually."

"All right, one moment."
I can swim across this river a hundred thousand times over!
"I'll have you know, I do 2:12 on the back."
"If I was a woman, I would be a state champion in women's swimming."
- When I was a little boy...
"I, too, spent summers in camps."
We had it tough back then.
Had to sleep in makeshift shelters...
Cook on open fire.
Had to fetch our own water.
And do our own laundry.
"In other words, none of the comforts of life whatsoever."
And now?
Look around.
Fish contains all the vitamins!

"Whatever, man."
Why do you awaken me without skin?
What of our bargain?
You promised me flesh!
Raw nerves exposed to the world!
Every step is a new nightmare!
All I feel is pain!
You!

You want me to feel the pain?
"Yes, you want me to understand it."
So that I may show others.
Huzzah!
Excelsior!

Why am I acting this way?
Am I a pervert?
"Good night, Princess."
How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.
I also have...
"I have a worry, too."
But don't...
Don't tell your sister.
Your sister...
Here... flowers...
She wants me to propose like this.
Why'd she hit me?
Not enough money?

I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!
And what kind of name is that for a chat room?
"""Welcoming Dumpy Housewives"" Weird taste!"
Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.
Let's eat first.
Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.
"- Hey, why are you getting in?"
- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.
There' no taxi here.
That's your problem.
Close the door!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
I was just kidding.. Get in.
The rich.
The landowners.
Now they'll be yours.
"Cows, bulls, hens, pigs - all yours."
Give me back my cow!
"You'll have to wait, my dear."
We'll give you everything in time.
You're a free woman.
A citizeness!
Here's where they buried him.
"Next morning the grave was open, the coffin empty."
Since then everyone passing by the graveyard gets in trouble.
- But people do drive past.
- But it's not him...
Didn't Pyotr go at night?
Hear that?
Hear that?
Father!
Look!
THE AVENGERS
Good Lord!
Is it true?
- Honest to God.
- He's talking through his hat.
"I didn't believe it myself at first, then looked around... and saw a coffin flying over the graves."
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound... not a sound.
Stop!
Stop!
You do better today.
"But when you kick him in the belly, swing your leg harder."
- Got it?
Let them be happy...
Sorry...
You bring us tea and etc...
That's why...
Bring your tea when you come next time.
I'll brew it for you...
"Please, no money!"
Mustooo!
My brother!
How are you?
Eh?
Look what Muko brother has brought for you...
Do you remember what you did to neighbourhood's dogs and cats?
"Wasn't this Uncle Aslan's dog, Kral (King)?"
Do you remember this?
We used to hunt with this in the garden of your village house.
You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.
All of them are your marks...
"Look, do you remember this?"
"You did this to me, remember?"
"He doesn't even look, dude..."
He is completely lost.
Unbelievable...
My brother...
My dearest brother...
Come on...
Take this.
Musto???
You see...
"He took the sling, dude."
"Keep your maniac under control, brother..."
Move over.
Let's go to the station first.
I'm gonna throw them into the can!
I'm gonna throw you into hell!!
"-You guys come along too, we need witness."
- Ok.
You stop!
Stop there!
You stop right there.
"Come here, you..."
Don't come any closer.
Let go of me.
Don't follow me!
Stop right there!
"Man, I'm dumb."
"I should have ran downhill. if you don't have the smarts, the body suffers."
"Dammit, look who it is?"
Dear hubby.
You bastard.
You put someone after me!
Where are you?
Tell me now!
I You're dead!
You crazy?
Tell you where I am?
You think I won't catch you?
I'll chase you to the end and throw you in the can.
Sure.
I'll just go to the ends of the earth and wait.
We'll have it out there!
Are you in your right mind?
Making jokes?
- You must be bored here.
- I'm not bored.
Sashka Belykh gave me a book of magic tricks.
I've been practising.
"Wanna see the""Flying Queen?"""
- Sure!
- That's where you are!
Snitches!
"- Who, we?"
- And your stupid flowers!
- Can't trust you with a secret!
- Who told Dynin?
- You are the snitches!
- We?
- Who else?
Who took the mirror and Shagalova to Dynin?
- They're not out there just killing for fame.
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.
- Every major city.
These guys are playing God.
"I mean, this whole religious twist?"
Who the hell do they think they are?
"Hell yeah, I believe in capital punishment!"
If they let me I'll pull the switch.
Get 'em all!
Kill 'em all!
"I'm all for it... because the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody"
"No, ...you don't even know!"
- Sign me up man.
- Sign me up.
- Where can I sign up?
- Yes.
- Or are you protecting someone?
No.
Or are you carrying the can since you don't got much time left?
- No.
"- Tell me, who wanted this from you?"
- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."
- What's your problem?
- What do you want?
We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.
"Okay, thanks."
You were on duty again last night?
You didn't sleep.
Was it hard last time you were in jail as well?
What is it to you?
Whatever man.
"Hey, what is this?"
Did it again?
You did it again?
You washed my pants with the letter in it?
Why don't you check it before?
What am I gonna do with this now?
"- I am sorry, abi."
- Fuck your apology.
When are you gonna stop being stupid?
You're the one who shouldn't have kept your letter in your pockets.
Fuck you.
Eat your breakfast.
Do it like he does.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"For breakfast at midnight,"
To fall in love with strangers.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
Yeah!
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely at the same time,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when,"
"We forget about the deadlines,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if,"
You keep me next to you.
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright,"
"If we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!"
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"This place is too crowded,"
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?
Ew).
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"We ditch the whole scene,"
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah!
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.

10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.

Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!

Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.

Bonnie!

These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."

"I am not a god, I am not a king"
I'm a man
I'm just a man who reached for too big a prize!
Where is he now?
Octavius has taken Pelusium
That quickly
Give these to Rufio
Have him deliver them to Octavius
But these are the emblems of your office!
Send them to him with this letter
I am offering my abdication if he'll spare Caesarian... and let him sit on the throne of Egypt
"But why, Your Majesty?"
Has it really come to this?
There is no other recourse
We must buy time
Go now!
Down
Out of my way!
Stop it!
What?
What?
Why did you stop...
"Welcome, welcome Aphrodite!"
Welcome to Bacchus's beach!
Octavius has reached Ashkelon
Ashkelon is weeks away from Alexandria
Then you will die
These men are loyal to Antony
"Yes, but they will follow your lead"
Antony!
Antony!
Stop him!
Move!
Get after him!
He's wonderful with the child
"I shouldn't wonder, he's a child himself"
You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?
"You are strong, my queen"
You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision
And he's not weak
Grattius!
What is it?
Why are you come to Alexandria?
Your Lordship
Octavius has stolen your legions in Gaul
General Cornelius?

Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

"Changing how factors are grouped in a multiplication does not change its product either. This is called the ""associative property of multiplication""."
For example: formula_33
Multiplicative inverses (reciprocals).
The reciprocal of a number formula_34 is formula_35. A number formula_34 times its reciprocal formula_35 is always equal to 1: formula_38
"For example, the reciprocal of 3 is 1/3, because formula_39"
"To get the reciprocal of a fraction, switch the numerator and the denominator: the reciprocal of formula_40 is formula_41"
Division.
"Division is the fourth arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of multiplication. The number that is being divided is the ""dividend"" and the number it is divided by is the ""divisor"". The number on top of a fraction is called the ""numerator"" and the number at the bottom is called the ""denominator"". The result of a division is called a ""quotient""."
Division is repeated subtraction.
The symbol for division is / or a fraction.
Examples of divisions:
formula_42
formula_43
formula_44
formula_45
formula_46
"Because of the ""multiplicative identity"", any number divided by one is the same number (formula_47)."
Division by zero is undefined (formula_48).
"In a fraction, switching the numerator and the denominator gives the reciprocal of the fraction."
For example: formula_49
Exponentiation.
"Exponentiation is the fifth arithmetic operation and the third hyperoperation. It is one of the inverse operations of roots and logarithms. The number that is being multiplied is the ""base"" and the number of times it is multiplied is the ""exponent"". The result of an exponentiation is called a ""power""."
Exponentiation is repeated multiplication or division.
The symbol for exponentiation is the superscript (xy) or the caret (^).

Tawfiq noted who had a significant influence on his future works:
"""After my teacher, miss Suheir al-Qalmawi, has read my verses, I became her favorite student. That made me very glad because al-Qalmawi was the first person who discovered me like a poet. She compared me with known American writer Edgar Allan Poe. I have heard about this author but never read any of his texts. That's why just next day I found a book with Poe's verses and read there his poem ""The Raven"". I didn't understand some moments, but soon I found my teacher, professor Muhammad Mandur, who translated this poem into Arabic. He, and the other professor, Yusef Khalif, helped me on my way to become a poet in future""."
"Tawfiq noted the influence of the Writers Association of Egypt on his future literary preferences, stating"
"""I will never forget, that through Writers Association of Egypt, authors of my generation had opportunity to become acquainted with such famous writers and poets as Salah Abdel Sabour, Farouk Khorshid, Abdelgafar Makawi, Izuddin Ismail, Husein Nisar, Abdel Qader al-Qytt, Abdel Rahman al-Sharqawi, Ahmad Kemal Zaki, Ahmad Husein as-Saui, Muhammad Abdel Wahid, Malek Abdel Aziz and others ..."""

1301PE is a gallery in Los Angeles founded by Brian D. Butler in 1992.
"Butler began Brain Multiples in 1991 to finance, edit, publish and distribute artists’ editions. Rather than representing artists, Butler collaborated with them on projects in which he found interest. Artists who have produced Brain Multiples with Butler include John Baldessari, Rachel Khedoori, Paul McCarthy, Jorge Pardo, Philippe Parreno, Jason Rhoades, Katy Schimert, Diana Thater and Rirkrit Tiravanija, among others."
"The original incarnation of 1301PE was as 1301, which was located at Butler’s apartment, 1301 Franklin Street, Santa Monica, CA. The founding principle was to present world class exhibitions of artists primarily based in Los Angeles. The first show at 1301 was ""Raw Material"" by Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, which opened on 29 April 1992. Shows at 1301 featured work by artists Jamey Bair, Angela Bulloch, Meg Cranston, Sarah Seager and Thaddeus Strode, as well as a group show called ""Into the Lapse"" which presented video work by artists General Idea, Sean Landers, Jim Shaw, Diana Thater, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and others."
"In 1996, 1301 became 1310PE, standing for Projects and Editions. For a period 1301PE had no permanent location, and Butler curated exhibitions in other galleries, such as an exhibition of the artist Angela Bulloch at the gallery owned by Marc Foxx. Other projects curated during this time included a collaboration between an Iranian carpet weaver and the artist Mike Kelley, the work ""Ranch"" by Jorge Pardo and Jason Rhoades, and Diana Thater’s presentation of ""The best animals are the flat animals"" and ""The best space is the deep space"" at MAK Center for Art and Architecture."
"In 1998, 1301PE reopened in its current location on the Miracle Mile in Los Angeles. Since its reopening, 1301PE has continued to exhibit the work of Los Angeles-based as well as internationally acclaimed artists. In addition to established artists whom the gallery has represented, such as Fiona Banner, Uta Barth, Charline von Heyl, Jack Goldstein, Ann Veronica Janssens, Judy Ledgerwood, Philippe Parreno, John Reynolds, Jessica Stockholder, Pae White, and Paul Winstanely, 1301PE also works with young artists including Jan Albers, Fiona Connor, Kirsten Everberg, Jorge Mendez Blake, Blake Rayne, SUPERFLEX, and Kerry Tribe."

Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."

"Charles Bodinier (6 January 1844 - 1911) was a French theater manager. After working for the Comédie-Française he became director of the Théâtre d'Application and then of the Théâtre La Bodinière. La Bodinière appealed to an elite audience, and staged a variety of lectures and performances until Bodinier retired in 1902."
"Charles Bodinier was born on 6 January 1844 in Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine-et-Loire."
"He became a professional soldier, and was captured in the war of 1870."
He was not released until 1874. In 1876 he joined the staff of the Comédie-Française.
Bodinier was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park.

"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."

Denizen is an action computer game published by Players Software in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum.
"""Denizen"" is a science-fiction action flip-screen maze game, with a top-down perspective. The player controls a marine, with the aim of detonating twenty explosive bolts on each of three levels. The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"".

= = = Law of Illinois = = =
"The law of Illinois consists of several levels, including constitutional, statutory, and regulatory law, as well as case law and local law. The ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"" (ILCS) form the general statutory law."
"The Constitution of Illinois is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted by the Illinois General Assembly, published in the ""Laws of Illinois"", and codified in the ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"" (ILCS). State agencies publish regulations (sometimes called administrative law) in the ""Illinois Register"", which are in turn codified in the ""Illinois Administrative Code"". Illinois's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court, which are published on the website of the Supreme Court. Counties, townships, cities, and villages may also promulgate local ordinances. There are also several sources of persuasive authority, which are not binding authority but are useful to lawyers and judges insofar as they help to clarify the current state of the law."

"He Zhen, also known as Zhou Cheng, Chang Qing, Xue Yu (1541 – 1606) was a Chinese artist during the Ming Dynasty, who specialised in carving personal seals. Along with his teacher Wen Peng, he was one of the first seal-engravers to use soapstone as a medium for his work."
"He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving."
"He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style calligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."

"McGirr was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1922 and served continuously until 1952, holding the various seats of Cootamundra, Cumberland, Bankstown, and Liverpool. Having served in the third ministry of Jack Lang, and the first and second ministries of William McKell, McGirr was variously torn between Lang Labor and the newly formed Australian Labor Party. When McKell stood aside as Premier in 1947 in order to take up an appointment as Governor-General of Australia, McGirr was elected Labor Leader and became Premier."

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

The implication was that the Duke's proposal to increase the taxation was due to the insufficiency of his revenues for state expenditure; to insure the sufficiency of state expenditure, then, what could take precedence over measures to insure sufficiency for his people?"

Essay Topic:
"“Zi Mo (子莫) holds on to the middle… Holding on to the middle is closer to being right, but to do this without the proper measure is not different from holding to one extreme.”"
1. Pòtí:
"Mencius’ contemporary Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviation of heterodox teachings, but did not realize that he himself fell into deviation."
2. Chéngtí:
"The fact is, the middle is defined as “not deviant,” and the correct application of the middle is the proper measure. Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviant ways of Yang Zi (楊子) and Mo Zi (墨子), but did not know the proper measure, so this was but another deviation. This was the standard Mencius used to repudiate his error and to establish our way."
3. Qǐjiǎng:
"To elaborate, for our Way is the principal one, but the manifestations are many; egoism and indiscriminate love certainly deviate from the Way. And our way uses the one principle to join together the many, but those who hold on to egoism or indiscriminate love are certainly holding on to an extreme which leads nowhere. Thus there was Zi Mo who understood the errors of Yang Zi and Mo Zi, and thereupon mediated between the two in order to grasp the middle course."
4. Qǐgǔ:
"Zi Mo would probably say, I cannot bear to be like Yang Zi, who cut off all ties with others in a niggardly fashion; I simply stop short of loving indiscriminately."
I have not time to be like Mo Zi who joyfully sacrifices himself for others: I simply stop short of being an egoist.
"Because one rejects egoism, one may be thought to be escaping from the error of Yang Zi and heading towards benevolence."
"Because one rejects indiscriminate love, one may be thought to be escaping for the error of Mo Zi and heading towards righteousness."

"A nonconvex polyhedron has intersecting faces which do not represent new edges or faces. In the picture vertices are marked by golden spheres, and edges by silver cylinders."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 4 hexagonal faces passing through the model center. The hexagons intersect each other and so only triangle portions of each are visible.

Darbandokeh is a former Assyrian village located in the sub-district of Harir and in the district of Shaqlawa. It is populated by Kurds today.
"The Assyrians of Darbandokeh came right after the Assyrian genocide that took place within the Ottoman Empire. They came from the Shamezdin region, located within Hakkari, Turkey and are of the Nochiya tribe. In 1938, fifteen families totaling 108 people lived in the village. As a result of forced migration in the late 20th century, today no Assyrians remain in the village of Darbandokeh. The Assyrian quarter of the village was resettled by pro-government Kurds after the entire village's population fled in 1963 due to fighting."
"Darbandokeh is the birthplace of many renowned Assyrians. It is where the Patriarch of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Dinkha IV, was born. It is also the birthplace of the former Secretary General of the Assyrian Universal Alliance, Emanuel Kamber."
"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968."
"Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor."
"The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s."

"Marina Rebeka (born 1980) is a Latvian opera, song and concert soprano."
Marina Rebeka is one of the leading sopranos of our time and considered one of the
world's best Violettas in Verdi's “La Traviata”. She has also gained a wide reputation as one
of the greatest Rossini and Mozart singers in the world.
"Since her international breakthrough at the Salzburg Festival in 2009 under the baton of Riccardo Muti, Marina has been a regular guest at the world's most prestigious concert halls and opera houses, such as Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall (New York), Teatro alla Scala (Milan), Royal Opera House Covent Garden (London), Concertgebouw (Amsterdam), Bavarian State Opera (Munich), Bavarian State Opera, Musikverein (Vienna), and Zurich Opera House."
"She collaborates with leading conductors such as Riccardo Muti, Zubin Mehta, Antonio Pappano, Fabio Luisi, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Daniele Gatti, Marco Armiliato, Michele Mariotti, Thomas Hengelbrock, Paolo Carignani, Kent Nagano, and Ottavio Dantone."
"Outstanding is her varied repertoire, which ranges from Baroque (Handel) to Bel Canto"
"(Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti), and Verdi (La Traviata) to Tchaikovsky (Eugene Onegin) and"
Britten (War Requiem).
"As an active and widely noticed concert performer, she has given recitals at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, the “Rudolfinum” Concert Hall in Prague, St. John's Hall in London, Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Großes Festspielhaus Salzburg, Palau de la Música in Barcelona and Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, accompanied by such ensembles as the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and Filarmonici della Scala."
"Her first solo CD, “Mozart Arias” with Speranza Scappucci and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, was released by EMI (Warner Classics) in November 2013. Her next album, “Amor fatale” – Rossini arias with Marco Armiliato and the Münchner Rundfunkorchester - was released in the summer of 2017 by BR-Klassik."
"Born in Riga, Marina Rebeka began her musical studies in Latvia and continued in Italy, where she graduated from the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome (2007). During her studies, she also attended the International Summer Academy in Salzburg and Rossini Academy in Pesaro."
"In the 2017/18 season she was named the first-ever artist in residence by the Münchner Rundfunkorchester. In December 2016 she was granted Order of the Three Stars, the highest award of the Republic of Latvia, for her cultural achievements."

= = = Affine gauge theory = = =
"Affine gauge theory is classical gauge theory where gauge fields are affine connections on the tangent bundle over a smooth manifold formula_1. For instance, these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula_2, the generalization of metric-affine gravitation theory when formula_1 is a world manifold and, in particular, gauge theory of the fifth force."
"Being a vector bundle, the tangent bundle formula_4 of an formula_5-dimensional manifold formula_1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula_7, called the ""affine tangent bundle"", possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions. It is associated to a principal bundle formula_8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula_1, whose structure group is a general affine group formula_10."
"The tangent bundle formula_4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula_12, whose structure group is a general linear group formula_13. This is a subgroup of formula_10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula_13 and a group formula_16 of translations."
There is the canonical imbedding of formula_12 to formula_8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula_4 as the affine one.
Given linear bundle coordinates
"on the tangent bundle formula_4, the affine tangent bundle can be provided with affine bundle coordinates"
"and, in particular, with the linear coordinates (1)."
