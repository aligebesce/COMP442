"And this is, this is about the leaflet is it?"
Yeah.
Yes.
Get all the information.
Decide on how we do the  thing.
And erm do take it
To go into details of that it's probably much more sensible to do it with just two or three people.
But er  at least if we can  pull the information together that evening that'd be a start.
Form a sub committee!
Ooh!

Thank you.
Erm quite a valid point.
"The, unless we want to brief to our staff the potential hazards in er"
Mm.
Well.
the use of dumpers on er  sites.
I think we should.
"There are two points that I, you would be looking at normally if you were investigating it."
One would be
Crippled him.
"were the, were th were the dumpers in good working order and had"
Yeah.
they been serviced properly?
Which is something which happens which is done through R Es.
And the other one is did the d what sort of certification did the drivers have?
Yeah.
Even if it was only a car driver's license.
Mm.
And did we er
A a and
subject them to a drugs and alcohol test
Mm.
afterwards.
Oh ho
A and was the er was their method of operating the dumper in accordance with the site safety plan?
Erm now how are we going to measure acceleration?
"Let's say we've got erm a radar for, for measuring speed"
Mm.
velocity.
Okay.
"And we'll set up a, so we're going to, you, you devise an experiment, Neil."
Measure acceleration.
"There's a car, and we want to know its acceleration between two points."
doesn't matter.
There's your car.
Erm  you start the stopwatch.
Er stopwatch you m you time it from  there  to the ten metre.
Erm what's along your X axis?
Your independent variable?
Time.
Time.
"So, when would you next check its acceleration?"
Would you measure in terms of distance
"or in, in terms of other time"
Time.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
We'll make it one second.
Okay.
Make it one second.
"Alright, make it ten."
"Sorry,, make it ten seconds."
Plus one second.
"Then the you have to  have y how far the car has travelled,"
Do you?
know how quickly.
What is acceleration?
"And Michael es , and Michael especially."
Mm mm.
But
Cos I do chicken with ginger which
Th
is really nice.
"Chicken, ginger"
Oh do you?
and cashew nuts.
Oh!
You haven't given that to me.
With root ginger or powdered ginger.
It's root ginger.
It's delicious!
Very strong.
Cos it's very subtle.
But it's in a
Oh I
packet is it?
It's actually very subtle.
Mhm.
It's delicious.
"So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger."
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.
Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger  peels it
Really?
and chops it
and puts it with a pound of  Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken  outside  it's just lightly rubbed with oil
Mm mm.
and then about two ounces of powdered ginger  sprinkled over it.
I will say that.
"It, it, perhaps there's something wrong with the dumper."
Was it
Doesn't it say whether it's the same dumper?
Was it the same dumper?
Yeah.
No.
It isn't.
what are the recommendations?
"What are the report, what, what's in clauses what used to be thirty seven and thirty eight?"
Recommended course of action and stuff like that.
We're not
That's a good question Terry.
Were these dumper drivers certificated?
Why it happened?
I mean
I've   of watching brief jobs for which we are not responsible.
Oh.
It's nowt to do with us then isn't it?
Well.
I'm I mean
I'm not being facetious but what is the bloody point
No.
It's s
in telling us
I don't know why you're clogging our meetings up with somebody else's accidents.
Because I'm supposed to report all accidents
Yeah.
to here.
Yes.
He is.
It's it's my
Right.
Right.
Next one.
What is the customer obliged to provide da to load and unload a consignment?
"Who di , who got the answer?"
Not exact.
"I, er I said suitable lifting or moving equipment."
I'd accept that.
"Plant, power or labour."
Moving equipment then.
Yeah
That's
I got that one.
what I said to you.
Ah!
I got that.
Did you accept it Paul?
It got one.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you did?"
Yeah about  lifting equipment?
About power lifting equipment.
Yeah I'd accept that.
Cup of tea for the driver.
What we actually put
"Cup of tea, sustenance , yeah."
"What we actually put is, er, it is the responsibility in the conditions of carriage."
It is a responsibility.
Where would you find the conditions of carriage.
On the back of every erm  contract out there.
On the back of every contract.
Because  it is subject to the conditions of carriage  that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information.
Oh fabulous!
What?
"You mean, in other words, you won't have life insurance left."
"So money you've put into life insurance, goes?"
"Well that's what the life insurance is for, to pay the house off."
Oh!
Put that against the value of the house.
"Oh, great!"
So
So
in other words the money from your life insurance will pay the mortgage?
Yes.
So we've not got that much hassle then?
"No, not yet."
"So  well then, what you worrying about?"
I wasn't worried!
Good!
Glad to hear it!
Now where was I?
What happened to the grand throw out this year?
I wasn't worried at all.
"Listen though if, we can't keep everything again!"
If we go through and chuck out all the grotty stuff.
Like what?
"Well, wardrobes and stuff like that."
"Cos, we can get rid of these can't we?"
Sell these?
No!
"That, this and that."
No!
"But keep th , keep the"
Absolutely not!
Mm.
so can we talk about what your losses are?
We w suggest that you have losses under the heading of er
Mm.
"disruption to traffic, loss of revenue, so on and so forth"
Mm.
and I think we have er a a part to play in that.
Mm.
What about my extra costs?
And your extra supervision costs.
No.
I was thinking about the client's extra costs.
Oh.
Then the  gain
actually.
overrun by three weeks
the fact that we've still got our supervision
Yeah.
"But, but we put that in."
Yeah.
But during
Not only that
Yeah.
"But we, we should be prompting them."
course that we know about it.
"Well there's the fact that he might have borrowed the money for a ten million pound project, and he can't have a use of it because it's named  and he's paying interest"
on that ten million pounds.
Extended plus services for diverted traffic and so on.
be discussed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what
Not guilty.
"Also, that on the twenty first of June you've used the motor vehicle  at Worley on Accrington Road when there was no test certificate in force."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
"Also, that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
"And, finally that you failed to produce a test certificate."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Has he produced these documents to you Miss ?
No sir.
Have you got the insurance with you?
Yes.
The test certificate with you?
Everything my solicitor  was outside.
What?
"I give them to that solicitor that, I were talking to."
Which duty solicitor?
His duty solicitor's
Oh!
Mr .
.
likely to receive custodial sentences.
in this instance.
I can't see any harm  .
Would you like me to show the the prosecuting solicitor?
Well perhaps it'll save time.
.
Mm?
Knowing business effects it.
No  take them off.
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
Joanna !
"Nay , by the sacred rood !"
where is she ?
"Host , where is that girl ? ''"
"`` Girl , Sir Daniel ? ''"
cried the landlord .
"`` Nay , sir , I saw no girl . ''"
"`` Boy , then , dotard ! ''"
cried the knight .
`` Could ye not see it was a wench ?
"She in the murrey-coloured mantle -- she that broke her fast with water , rogue -- where is she ? ''"
"`` Nay , the saints bless us !"
"Master John , ye called him , '' said the host ."
"`` Well , I thought none evil ."
He is gone .
I saw him -- her -- I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; ' a was saddling a grey horse . ''
"`` Now , by the rood ! ''"
"cried Sir Daniel , `` the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . ''"
"`` Sir knight , '' observed the messenger , with bitterness , `` while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` Selden , fall me out with six cross-bowmen ; hunt me her down ."
"I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House ."
Be it upon your head .
"And now , sir messenger , we march . ''"
"And the troop broke into a good trot , and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley , with the staring villagers ."
CHAPTER II -- IN THE FEN It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way .
The sky was all blue ; the jolly wind blew loud and steady ; the windmill-sails were spinning ; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn .
"He had been all night in the saddle , but his heart was good and his body sound , and he rode right merrily ."
"The path went down and down into the marsh , till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him , and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before ."
"On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows , pools of water shaking in the wind , and treacherous bogs , as green as emerald , to tempt and to betray the traveller ."
The path lay almost straight through the morass .
"It was already very ancient ; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery ; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk , and every here and there , for a few hundred yards , it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen ."
"`` Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you ."
"An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . ''"
"`` Well , '' cried the lad , flushing , `` ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other ."
Laugh while yet ye may ! ''
"`` Nay , now , good cousin , '' replied Sir Daniel , with some earnestness , `` think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends ."
"I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to !"
and cherish you exceedingly .
"I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ."
"Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton -- Lady Shelton , by my troth !"
for the lad promiseth bravely .
Tut !
ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy .
"They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin ."
"Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John ."
"Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Master John , `` I will break no bread ."
"Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul 's interest ."
"But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . ''"
"`` Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! ''"
cried the knight .
"`` Shalt be well shriven , by my faith !"
"Content you , then , and eat . ''"
"But the lad was obstinate , drank a cup of water , and , once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle , sat in a far corner , brooding ."
"In an hour or two , there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses ; and then a troop drew up by the inn door , and Richard Shelton , splashed with mud , presented himself upon the threshold ."
"`` Save you , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` How !
Dickie Shelton ! ''
cried the knight ; and at the mention of Dick 's name the other lad looked curiously across .
`` What maketh Bennet Hatch ? ''
"`` Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , '' answered Richard , presenting the priest 's letter ."
"`` And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . ''"
`` How say you ?
A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts -- they shall all taste arrows -- no man of them shall struggle through this wood .
"For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed -- all oppressed !"
"Who , then , hath done this evil ?"
"Sir Daniel , by the rood !"
Shall he then profit ?
shall he sit snug in our houses ?
shall he till our fields ?
shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ?
I trow not .
"He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain -- I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . ''"
Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale .
"He raised it , as if to pledge the speaker ."
"`` Master Ellis , '' he said , `` y ' are for vengeance -- well it becometh you !"
"-- but your poor brother o ' the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing ."
He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . ''
"`` Lawless , '' replied the other , `` to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest ."
"We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle ."
"Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us -- all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid -- we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him ."
'T is a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . ''
"`` Ay , '' returned Lawless , `` I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis ."
And meanwhile what do we ?
"We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . ''"
"`` Y ' are untrue , Will Lawless ."
"Ye still smell of the Grey Friars ' buttery ; greed is your undoing , '' answered Ellis ."
`` We took twenty pounds from Appleyard .
We took seven marks from the messenger last night .
A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . ''
"`` And to-day , '' said one of the men , `` I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood ."
Here is his purse . ''
Ellis counted the contents .
`` Five score shillings ! ''
he grumbled .
"`` A mother is the best thing in the world -- I realized that when I lost mine , '' said Alan gently ."
`` How long is it since your mother died ? ''
`` Three years .
"Oh , I thought I should die too when she did ."
"She was very ill -- she was never strong , you know -- but I never thought she could die ."
There was a year then -- part of the time I did n't believe in God at all and the rest I hated Him .
I was very wicked but I was so unhappy .
Father had so many dreadful moods and -- there was something else .
I used to wish to die . ''
She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground .
"Alan , leaning against a pine tree , looked down at her ."
The sunlight fell through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood brown .
"All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time and she seemed like a helpless , weary child ."
He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her .
"`` You must resemble your mother , '' he said absently , as if thinking aloud ."
`` You do n't look at all like your father . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , I do n't look like Mother either ."
She was tiny and dark -- she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair .
"Oh , I remember her look so well ."
I wish I did resemble her .
I loved her so -- I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble .
"At least , she died in peace . ''"
There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl 's voice as she spoke the last sentence .
Again Alan felt the unpleasant impression that there was much in her that he did not understand -- might never understand -- although such understanding was necessary to perfect friendship .
"She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him before , yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in jealous repression ."
"It must be something connected with her father , Alan thought ."
"Doubtless , Captain Anthony 's past would not bear inspection , and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her knowledge ."
His heart filled with aching pity for her ; he raged secretly because he was so powerless to help her .
"Her girlhood had been blighted , robbed of its meed of happiness and joy ."
Was she likewise to miss her womanhood ?
Alan 's hands clenched involuntarily at the unuttered question .
But Ginger 's feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship .
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold .
`` Why do you call him Ginger ? ''
"asked Anne , who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage ."
`` My brother the sailor named him .
Maybe it had some reference to his temper .
I think a lot of that bird though ... you 'd be surprised if you knew how much .
He has his faults of course .
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another .
Some people object to his swearing habits but he ca n't be broken of them .
I 've tried ... other people have tried .
Some folks have prejudices against parrots .
"Silly , ai n't it ?"
I like them myself .
Ginger 's a lot of company to me .
"Nothing would induce me to give that bird up ... nothing in the world , miss . ''"
Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up .
"Anne , however , was beginning to like the queer , fussy , fidgety little man , and before the meal was over they were quite good friends ."
Mr. Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it .
`` That 's right .
Go ahead .
There 's lots of room for improvement in this settlement ... and in the people too . ''
"`` Oh , I do n't know , '' flashed Anne ."
"To herself , or to her particular cronies , she might admit that there were some small imperfections , easily removable , in Avonlea and its inhabitants ."
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing .
"`` I think Avonlea is a lovely place ; and the people in it are very nice , too . ''"
"`` I guess you 've got a spice of temper , '' commented Mr. Harrison , surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him ."
"`` It goes with hair like yours , I reckon ."
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I would n't have located here ; but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults ? ''
"`` I like it all the better for them , '' said loyal Anne ."
`` I do n't like places or people either that have n't any faults .
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting .
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"Jane said so, but George said, ""Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."""
"The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of tall lilies."
"And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring."
"""It's bears,"" said Jane. ""I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."""
"The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur dresses, and the white silence was quite gone."
"""Bears, indeed,"" cried a shrill voice. ""You'll wish we were bears before you've done with us."""
"This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference between ""lawn"" and ""grass"" did not seem so great as it had at Forest Hill."
"Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen anyone cry before."
"""Don't cry for real,"" whispered George, ""or you'll get chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl it frightens them."""
"So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You try it."
"Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane, George said: ""Yah who's afraid? We are George and Jane who are you?"""
"""We are the sealskin dwarfs,"" said the brown people, twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in kaleidoscopes. ""We are very precious and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very best sealskin."""
"""And what are those fires for?"" bellowed George for Jane was crying louder and louder."
"""Those,"" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, ""are the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now so he sleeps curled up around the Pole but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go and eat everybody in the world except us."""
"""WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT FOR?"" yelled George."
"""Oh just for spite,"" bawled the dwarfs carelessly as if they were saying, ""Just for fun."""
"Jane stopped crying to say: ""You are heartless."""
"""No, we aren't,"" they said. ""Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses """
"And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin."
"""Thank you so much for telling us,"" said George. ""Good evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"""
"But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence better."
"Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: ""What's that on your head?"""
And George felt it was all up for he knew it was his father's sealskin cap.
"The dwarf did not wait for an answer. ""It's made of one of us,"" he screamed, ""or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"""
"Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed."
"The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole."
"You have no idea how cold it was the kind of cold that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of."
"The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close and said: ""Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."""
"The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and colder."
"""We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one comfort,"" said George. ""We shall be turned into ice long before that."""
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"The following spring Washington was sent under General Fry to drive out the French, who had started farming at Pittsburg. Fry died, and Washington took command. He liked it very much. After that Washington took command whenever he could, and soon rose to be a great man."
"The first expedition against Fort Duquesne (pronounced du-kane) was commanded by General Braddock, whose portrait we are able to give, showing him at the time he did not take Washington's advice in the Duquesne matter. Later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking Washington's advice."
"""The Indians,"" said Braddock, ""may frighten Colonial troops, but they can make no impression on the king's regulars. We are alike impervious to fun or fear."""
"Braddock thought of fighting the Indians by man[oe]uvring in large bodies, but the first body to be man[oe]uvred was that of General Braddock, who perished in about a minute."
"We give the reader, above, an idea of Braddock's soldierly bearing after he had been man[oe]uvring a few times."
"It was then that Washington took command, as was his custom, and began to fight the Indians and French as one would hunt varmints in Virginia."
"Braddock's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the State line, but when most of the Colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as Philadelphia, where they each took a bath and had some laundry-work done."
General Forbes took command of the second expedition. He spent most of his time building roads.
"Time passed on, and Forbes built viaducts, conduits, culverts, and rustic bridges, till it was November, and they were yet fifty miles from the fort. He then decided to abandon the expedition, on account of the cold, and also fearing that he had not made all of his bridges wide enough so that he could take the captured fort home with him."
"Washington, however, though only an aidy kong of General Forbes, decided to take command. His mother had said to him over and over, ""George, in an emergency always take command."" He done so, as General Rusk would say. As he approached, the French set fire to the fort, and retreated, together with the Indians and Molly Maguires."
"Pittsburg now stands on this historic ground, and is one of the most delightful cities of America."
Many other changes were going on at this time. The English got possession of Acadia and the French forts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.
"In 1757 General Loudon collected an army for an attack on Louisburg. He drilled his troops all summer, and then gave up the attack because he learned that the French had one more skiff than he had."
The Loudons of America at the time of this writing are more quiet and sensible regarding their ancestry than any of the doodle-bug aristocracy of our promoted peasantry and the crested Yahoos of our cowboy republic.
The Loudons or Lowdowns of America had a very large family. Some of them changed their names and moved.
"The next year after the fox pass of General Loudon, Amherst and Wolfe took possession of the entire island."
"About the time of Braddock's justly celebrated expedition another started out for Crown Point. The French, under Dieskau (pronounced dees-kow), met the army composed of Colonial troops in plain clothes, together with the regular troops led by officers with drawn swords and overdrawn salaries. The regular general, seeing that the battle was lost, excused himself and retired to his tent, owing to an ingrowing nail which had annoyed him all day. Lyman, the Colonial officer now took command, and wrung victory from the reluctant jaws of defeat. For this Johnson, the English general, received twenty-five thousand dollars and a baronetcy, while Lyman received a plated butter-dish and a bass-wood what-not. But Lyman was a married man, and had learned to take things as they came."
"Four months prior to the capture of Duquesne, one thousand boats loaded with soldiers, each with a neat little lunch-basket and a little flag to wave when they hurrahed for the good kind man at the head of the picnic, viz., General Abercrombie, sailed down Lake George to get a whiff of fresh air and take Ticonderoga."
"When they arrived, General Abercrombie took out a small book regarding tactics which he had bought on the boat, and, after refreshing his memory, ordered an assault. He then went back to see how his rear was, and, finding it all right, he went back still farther, to see if no one had been left behind."
Abercrombie never forgot or overlooked any one. He wanted all of his pleasure-party to be where they could see the fight.
In that way he missed it himself. I would hate to miss a fight that way.
The Abercrombies of America mostly trace their ancestry back by a cut-off avoiding the general's line.
"Niagara had an expedition sent against it at the time of Braddock's trip. The commander was General Shirley, but he ran out of money while at the Falls and decided to return. This post did not finally surrender till 1759."
"This gave the then West to the English. They had tried for one hundred and forty years to civilize it, but, alas, with only moderate success."
"Prosperous and happy even while sniping in their fox-hunting or canvas-back-duck clothes, these people feel somewhat soothed for their lack of culture because they are well-to-do."
"In 1759 General Wolfe anchored off Quebec with his fleet and sent a boy up town to ask if there were any letters for him at the post-office, also asking at what time it would be convenient to evacuate the place."
"The reply came back from General Montcalm, an able French general, that there was no mail for the general, but if Wolfe was dissatisfied with the report he might run up personally and look over the W's."
"Wolfe did so, taking his troops up by an unknown cow-path on the off side of the mountain during the night, and at daylight stood in battle-array on the Plains of Abraham. An attack was made by Montcalm as soon as he got over his wonder and surprise. At the third fire Wolfe was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard some one exclaim,"
"""They run! They run!"""
It is the only historical question regarding America not fully settled by this book.
"Nothing more was heard of him till he turned up in a thinking part in ""Rip Van Winkle."""
"Many claims regarding the discovery of various parts of the United States had been previously made. The Cabots had discovered Labrador, the Spaniards the southern part of the United States; the Norsemen had discovered Minneapolis, and Columbus had discovered San Salvador and gone home to meet a ninety-day note due in Palos for the use of the Pinta, which he had hired by the hour."
But we are speaking of the discovery of New York.
"About this time a solitary horseman might have been seen at West 209th Street, clothed in a little brief authority, and looking out to the west as he petulantly spoke in the Tammany dialect, then in the language of the blank-verse Indian. He began, ""Another day of anxiety has passed, and yet we have not been discovered! The Great Spirit tells me in the thunder of the surf and the roaring cataract of the Harlem that within a week we will be discovered for the first time."""
"As he stands there aboard of his horse, one sees that he is a chief in every respect and in life's great drama would naturally occupy the middle of the stage. It was at this moment that Hudson slipped down the river from Albany past Fort Lee, and, dropping a nickel in the slot at 125th Street, weighed his anchor at that place. As soon as he had landed and discovered the city, he was approached by the chief, who said, ""We gates. I am one of the committee to show you our little town. I suppose you have a power of attorney, of course, for discovering us?"""
"""Yes,"" said Hudson. ""As Columbus used to say when he discovered San Salvador, 'I do it by the right vested in me by my sovereigns.' 'That oversizes my pile by a sovereign and a half,' says one of the natives; and so, if you have not heard it, there is a good thing for one of your dinner-speeches here."""
"""Very good,"" said the chief, as they jogged down-town on a swift Sixth Avenue elevated train towards the wigwams on 14th Street, and going at the rate of four miles an hour. ""We do not care especially who discovers us, so long as we hold control of the city organization. How about that, Hank?"""
"""That will be satisfactory,"" said Mr. Hudson, taking a package of imported cheese and eating it, so that they could have the car to themselves."
"""We will take the departments, such as Police, Street-Cleaning, etc., etc., etc., while you and Columbus get your pictures on the currency and have your graves mussed up on anniversaries. We get the two-moment horses and the country châteaux on the Bronx. Sabe?"""
"""That is, you do not care whose portrait is on the currency,"" said Hudson, ""so you get the currency."""
"Said the man, ""That is the sense of the meeting."""
"Thus was New York discovered via Albany and Fort Lee, and five minutes after the two touched glasses, the brim of the schoppin and the Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and New York was inaugurated."
"Obtaining a gentle and philanthropical gentleman who knew too well the city by gas-light, they saw the town so thoroughly that nearly every building in the morning wore a bright red sign which read"
+           +
|   BEWARE OF PAINT.   |
+           +
"Regarding the question as to who has the right to claim the priority of discovery of New York, I unite with one of the ablest historians now living in stating that I do not know."
"Here and there throughout the work of all great historians who are frank and honest, chapter after chapter of information like this will burst forth upon the eye of the surprised and delighted reader."
"Society at the time of the discovery of the blank-verse Indian of America was crude. Hudson's arrival, of course, among older citizens soon called out those who desired his acquaintance, but he noticed that club life was not what it has since become, especially Indian club life."
He found a nation whose regular job was war and whose religion was the ever-present prayer that they might eat the heart of their enemy plain.
"The Indian High School and Young Ladies' Seminary captured by Columbus, as shown in the pictures of his arrival at home and his presentation to the royal pair one hundred and seventeen years before this, it is said, brought a royal flush to the face of King Ferdie, who had been well brought up."
"This can be readily understood when we remember that the Indian wore at court a court plaster, a parlor-lamp-shade in stormy weather, made of lawn grass, or a surcingle of front teeth."
"They were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in figure; but in those days when the Pocahontas girls went barefooted till the age of eighty-nine years, chewed tobacco, kept Lent all winter and then ate a brace of middle-aged men for Easter, the figure must have been affected by this irregularity of meals."
"Unless the Pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her carriage and beauty, to be saved from death by her, as Smith was, and feel that she therefore had a claim on him, must have given one nervous prostration, paresis, and insomnia."
"The Indian and the white race never really united or amalgamated outside of Canada. The Indian has always held aloof from us, and even as late as Sitting Bull's time that noted cavalry officer said to the author that the white people who simply came over in the Mayflower could not marry into his family on that ground. He wanted to know why they had to come over in the Mayflower."
"""We were here,"" said the aged warrior, as he stole a bacon-rind which I used for lubricating my saw, and ate it thoughtfully, ""we were here and helped Adam 'round up' and brand his animals. We are an old family, and never did manual labor. We are just as poor and proud and indolent as those who are of noble blood. We know we are of noble blood because we have to take sarsaparilla all the time. We claim to come by direct descent from Job, of whom the inspired writer says,"
"""Old Job he was a fine young lad,       Sing Glory hallelujah."
"On the third day, at one P.M., Lee opened with one hundred and fifty guns on Cemetery Ridge. The air was a hornet's nest of screaming shells with fiery tails. As it lulled a little, out of the woods came eighteen thousand men in battle-array extending over a mile in length. The Yankees knew a good thing when they saw it, and they paused to admire this beautiful gathering of foemen in whose veins there flowed the same blood as in their own, and whose ancestors had stood shoulder to shoulder with their own in a hundred battles for freedom."
"Their sentiment gave place to shouts of battle, and into the silent phalanx a hundred guns poured their red-hot messages of death. The golden grain was drenched with the blood of men no less brave because they were not victorious, and the rich fields of Pennsylvania drank with thirsty eagerness the warm blood of many a Southern son."
"Yet they moved onward. Volley after volley of musketry mowed them down, and the puny reaper in the neglected grain gave place to the grim reaper Death, all down that unwavering line of gray and brown."
"They marched up to the Union breastworks, bayoneted the gunners at their work, planted their flags on the parapets, and, while the Federals converged from every point to this, exploding powder burned the faces of these contending hosts, who, hand to hand, fought each other to death, while far-away widows and orphans multiplied to mourn through the coming years over this ghastly folly of civil war."
"Whole companies of the Confederates rushed as prisoners into the arms of their enemies, and the shattered remnant of the battered foe retreated from the field."
"While all this was going on in Pennsylvania, Pemberton was arranging terms of surrender at Vicksburg, and from this date onward the Confederacy began to wobble in its orbit, and the President of this ill-advised but bitterly punished scheme began to wish that he had been in Canada when the war broke out."
"In April of the same year Admiral Dupont, an able seaman with massive whiskers, decided to run the fortifications at Charleston with iron-clads, but the Charleston people thought they could run them themselves. So they drove him back after the sinking of the Kennebec and the serious injury of all the other vessels."
"General Gillmore then landed with troops. Fort Wagner was captured. The 54th Regiment of colored troops, the finest organized in the Free States, took a prominent part and fought with great coolness and bravery. By December there were fifty thousand colored troops enlisted, and before the war closed over two hundred thousand."
It is needless to say that this made the Yankee unpopular at the time in the best society of the South.
"General Gillmore attempted to capture Sumter, and did reduce it to a pulp, but when he went to gather it he was met by a garrison still concealed in the basement, and peppered with volleys of hot shingle-nails and other bric-à-brac, which forced him to retire with loss."
He said afterward that Fort Sumter was not desirable anyhow.
"This closed the most memorable year of the war, with the price of living at the South running up to eight hundred and nine hundred dollars per day, and currency depreciating so rapidly that one's salary had to be advanced every morning in order to keep pace with the price of mule-steaks."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
LAST YEAR OF THE DISAGREEABLE WAR.
"General Grant was now in command of all the Union troops, and in 1864-5 the plan of operation was to prevent the junction of the Confederates, General Grant seeking to interest the army in Virginia under General Lee, and General Sherman the army of General Joseph E."
Johnston in Georgia.
"Sherman started at once, and came upon Johnston located on almost impregnable hills all the way to Atlanta. The battles of Dalton, Resaca, Dallas, Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw Mountain preceded Johnston's retreat to the intrenchments of Atlanta, July 10, Sherman having been on the move since early in May, 1864."
"Jefferson Davis, disgusted with Johnston, placed Hood in command, who made three heroic attacks upon the Union troops, but was repulsed."
"Sherman now gathered fifteen days' rations from the neighbors, and, throwing his forces across Hood's line of supplies, compelled him to evacuate the city."
"The historian says that Sherman was entirely supplied from Nashville via railroad during this trip, but the author knows of his own personal knowledge that there were times when he got his fresh provisions along the road."
"This expedition cost the Union army thirty thousand men and the Confederates thirty-five thousand. Besides, Georgia was the Confederacy, so far as arms, grain, etc., were concerned. Sherman attributed much of his success to the fact that he could repair and operate the railroad so rapidly. Among his men were Yankee machinists and engineers, who were as necessary as courageous fighters."
"""We are held here during many priceless hours,"" said the general, ""because the enemy has spoiled this passenger engine. Who knows any thing about repairing an engine?"""
"""I do,"" said a dusty tramp in blue. ""I can repair this one in an hour."""
"""What makes you think so?"""
"""Well, I made it."""
This was one of the strong features of Sherman's army. Among the hundred thousand who composed it there were so many active brains and skilled hands that the toot of the engine caught the heels of the last echoing shout of the battle.
"Learning that Hood proposed to invade Tennessee, Sherman prepared to march across Georgia to the sea, and if necessary to tramp through the Atlantic States."
"Hood was sorry afterwards that he invaded Tennessee. He shut Thomas up in Nashville after a battle with Schofield, and kept the former in-doors for two weeks, when all of a sudden Thomas exclaimed, ""Air! air! give me air!"" and came out, throwing Hood into headlong flight, when the Union cavalry fell on his rear, followed by the infantry, and the forty thousand Confederates became a scattered and discouraged mob spread out over several counties."
"The burning of Atlanta preceded Sherman's march, and, though one of the saddest features of the war, was believed to be a military necessity."
Those who declare war hoping to have a summer's outing thereby may live to regret it for many bitter years.
"However, the suggestion was not acted on. The Colonial soldiers declined to put on a bright red coat and a pill-box cap, that kept falling off in battle, thus delaying the carnage, but preferred to wear homespun which was of a neutral shade, and shoot their enemy from behind stumps. They said it was all right to dress up for a muster, but they preferred their working-clothes for fighting. After the war a statistician made the estimate that nine per cent. of the British troops were shot while ascertaining if their caps were on straight.[4]"
"General Israel Putnam was known as the champion rough rider of his day, and once when hotly pursued rode down three flights of steps, which, added to the flight he made from the English soldiers, made four flights. Putnam knew not fear or cowardice, and his name even to-day is the synonyme for valor and heroism."
CHAPTER XV.
"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, LL.D., PH.G., F.R.S., ETC."
"It is considered advisable by the historian at this time to say a word regarding Dr. Franklin, our fellow-townsman, and a journalist who was the Charles A. Dana of his time."
"Franklin's memory will remain green when the names of the millionaires of to-day are forgotten. Coextensive with the name of E. Rosewater of the Omaha Bee we will find that of Benjamin Franklin, whose bust sits above the fireplace of the writer at this moment, while a large Etruscan hornet is making a phrenological examination of same."
But let us proceed to more fully mark out the life and labors of this remarkable man.
"Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child. If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's parents they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen pairs of them!"
"Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea, and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer."
"It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom."
"It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it would harden so that ""A Constant Reader"" or ""Veritas"" could be stabbed with it and die soon."
"Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with them."
"His paper was called the New England Courant. It was edited jointly by James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want."
"Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the other was in jail."
"In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad., put it off on ""our informant"" and go right along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side."
"How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?"
"At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to ""sub"" for a few weeks and then got a regular ""sit."""
"Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy."
He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would think he owned the paper.
"In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was then regarded as a great man, and almost every one took his paper."
"Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him."
"Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the Gazette office for examination."
"Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess."
"In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to where it was addressed."
"Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a great deal of attention."

almost historical importance in the events of the German occupation.

LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm fond of her.  Nothing she wants that she hasn't
"got, is there?"
HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget
if you know him.
HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
LADY DEDMOND.  He's literary.  [With hesitation]  You--you don't
think he--puts--er--ideas into her head?
"HUNTINGDON.  I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a"
"bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows.  Can't see Clare----"
"LADY DEDMOND.  No.  Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be"
encouraged.  Listen!--It is her-coming in.  I can hear their voices.
Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The
"door bell rings] Tt!  There he is, I expect."
SIR CHARLES.  What are we goin' to say?
"HUNTINGDON.  Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for"
them.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Yes, lovely, Clare.  [FULLARTON abases eyes which"
"mechanically readjust themselves]  We can't stay for Bridge, my dear;"
"I just wanted to see you a minute, that's all.  [Seeing HUNTINGDON"
"coming in she speaks in a low voice to her husband]  Edward, I want"
"to speak to Clare.  How d'you do, Captain Huntingdon?"
MALISE.  I'll say good-night.
"He shakes hands with CLARE, bows to MRS. FULLARTON, and makes"
his way out.  HUNTINGDON and FULLERTON foregather in the
doorway.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  How are things, Clare?  [CLARE just moves her"
shoulders]  Have you done what I suggested?  Your room?
CLARE.  No.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Why not?
CLARE.  I don't want to torture him.  If I strike--I'll go clean.  I
expect I shall strike.
MRS. FULLARTON.  My dear!  You'll have the whole world against you.
"CLARE.  Even you won't back me, Dolly?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course I'll back you, all that's possible, but I"
can't invent things.
"CLARE.  You wouldn't let me come to you for a bit, till I could find"
my feet?
"LADY DEDMOND.  It's getting serious, Reginald.  I don't know what's"
to become of them.  You don't think the Rector--you don't think your
father would speak to Clare?
HUNTINGDON.  Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough.  He takes
anything of that sort to heart so--especially Clare.
SIR CHARLES.  Can't you put in a word yourself?
HUNTINGDON.  Don't know where the mischief lies.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road.  Very
"steady-goin' fellow, old George."
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, yes; George is all right, sir."
LADY DEDMOND.  They ought to have had children.
HUNTINGDON.  Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't.  I really
"don't know what to say, ma'am."
"SIR CHARLES.  Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often"
noticed parsons' daughters grow up queer.  Get too much morality and
rice puddin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  [With a clear look]  Charles!
SIR CHARLES.  What was she like when you were kids?
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, all right.  Could be rather a little devil, of"
"course, when her monkey was up."

Rosek smiled.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"

"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""

The word “Number” has been omitted: thus Hymn 22 means Hymn No. 22.
_Cf._ means compare. (Latin: confer).
"The original texts of German hymns found throughout the _Handbook_,"
"especially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions used in"
"one or more of the following works: _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, (Berne,"
"Ind., 1890); _Gesangbuch der Mennoniten_, (Canadian, 1942); _The"
"Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal_, (Concordia Pub. House, 1942);"
_Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen und häuslichen Gebrauch in
"Evangelischen Mennoniten-Gemeinden_, (Konferenz der süddeutschen"
"Mennoniten zu Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 1910); and Knapp, _Evangelischer"
Liederschatz_. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these
"versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater"
knowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has
been made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;
the use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the
"pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals."

"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
"Though I go bare, take ye no care,"
I am nothing a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.
"Back and side go bare, go bare,"
Both foot and hand go cold:
"But belly, God send thee good ale enough,"
Whether it be new or old.

"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"What did it mean? Hastily, I could fill in “Dearest Nettie,” and “I am"
"dying to see you.” Kennedy added, “The Recherche to-day,” that being"
"the name of a new apartment uptown, as well as “love and many kisses.”"
But “—rman”—what did that mean? Could it be Herman—Herman Schloss?
She was returning and we resumed our seats quickly.
Kennedy took the jewel case from her and examined it carefully. There
was not a mark on it.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said slowly, rising and handing it back to her,"
“have you told me all?”
"“Why—yes,” she answered."
Kennedy shook his head gravely.
“I’m afraid not. You must tell me everything.”
"“No—no,” she cried vehemently, “there is nothing more.”"
"We left and outside the Deluxe he paused, looked about, caught sight of"
a taxicab and hailed it.
“Where?” asked the driver.
"“Across the street,” he said, “and wait. Put the window in back of you"
"down so I can talk. I’ll tell you where to go presently. Now, Walter,"
sit back as far as you can. This may seem like an underhand thing to
"do, but we’ve got to get what that woman won’t tell us or give up the"

"""Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?"" Vance leaned back."
"""We need to plan our day."""
"""Quite simply, I thought it was time you and I got reacquainted, Dr."
"Vance. It's been a long time."""

The speaker clicked off.
"""Michael, I've got a very bad feeling about all this."" She was rising"

"He's going to kill us, Vance realized. After he's played with us a"
while. It's really quite simple.

"Then the speaker clicked on again. ""Please forgive me. There are so"

“Then we both saw the light creeping over the sea like a monstrous
"ghost. And it all lay so pallid and still,--did n't it?--as if it were"
a sea in a land of death. And then a cheeky little thrush began to
twitter.”
"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"
fich'isme_ about his philosophy which must be very consoling.”
"“I know what that is in English,” cried Stellamaris. “It is"
'don't-care-a-damativeness.' “ Her lips rounded roguishly over the
naughty syllable.
“Where did you learn that?”
“Walter told me.”
"“Walter must be clapped into irons, and fed on bread and water, and"
seriously spoken to.”
Unconsciously he had drifted into his usual manner of speech with her.
She laughed with a child's easy gaiety.

"_Far_, *** B. F."
"_Far_ ..., J. B."
"_Farr_, John."
The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.

How tired Solem was and drenched to the skin! But what could we do? Rush
up the mountainside and look at the accident too?
"""Can't he walk?"" somebody asked."
"""No, he's dead,"" said Solem, looking from one to another of us as though"
"to read in our faces whether his message seemed credible. ""He fell off; he"
"didn't want me to help him."""
A few more questions and answers. Josephine was already halfway across the
field; she was going to the village to telephone for the doctor.
"""We shall have to get him down,"" said the Danish mountaineer."
So he and I improvised a stretcher; Solem was instructed to take brandy
"and bandages to the site of the accident, and the Bergensians, the"
"Associate Master, Miss Torsen, and Mrs. Molie went with him."
"""Did you really say nothing to Solem about climbing the peak today?"" I"

Later that afternoon we returned with the lawyer on the stretcher. Solem

He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the

"Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated."
Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly

"Novosty seemed to be thinking out loud. ""What does it matter."""

One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy in
"1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and hanged at White Point on November"
8th.
"SCUDAMORE, CHRISTOPHER."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern in
"Hanover Street, Boston, in 1704, and hanged on Charles River, Boston Side,"
"on June 30th. A report of the trial and execution of these pirates,"
"describing Scudamore's conduct on the gallows, says: ""He appeared very"

"SCUDAMORE, PETER."
Belonging to Bristol.
"Surgeon in the _Mercy_ galley, and taken by Captain Roberts in 1721. It"
was a rule on all pirate vessels for the surgeon to be excused from
"signing the ship's articles. When the next prize was taken, if she carried"

wished to leave. But when Scudamore came on board the _Royal Fortune_ he

inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently

"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"

“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
"One of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping, in June,"
"1724. He was not one of the original crew of the _George_ galley, but was"
taken out of a prize and joined the pirates of his own free-will.
"ROBBINS, JAMES."
Hanged in Virginia in 1718 along with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.
"ROBBINS, JAMES."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"
Carolina.
"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"

And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats
they owned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that
"sprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one. “He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for"
"twenty years. On his last legs, I guess.”"
The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp
in the hand of the sleeper.
"“Gee!” he remarked. “He’s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish I"
knew the brand of hop that he smokes.”
"And then “Rap, rap, rap!” went the club of realism against the shoe"

Kennedy.
"“So it seems,” replied Cæsar with indifference. “I see that you speak"

“Mr. Severance and Mr. Dedham!”
"Severance entered hurriedly. “I am so glad to hear—ah, Boswell! Trent!”"
“How odd that you should all find your way here the very first evening
of your arrival!” And Jessica held out her hand with a placid smile.
"Miss Decker was more nervous, but five seasons were behind her. “Ah!”"
"continued Mrs. Pendleton, “and Mr. Dedham, too! This is a most charming"

“Charming beyond expression!” said Severance.
Trent and Boswell being obliged to rise when Miss Decker went forward to

“You are better?” whispered Severance. “I have been anxious.”

has approved of the following transfer. From R.N.R. to R.N.:
"Lieutenant Terence Aubyn, to date 3rd of June, 1915."""
For a moment Terence looked incredulously at the torpedo-lieutenant.

playing a prank it was carrying the game a little too far.
"""Here you are,"" continued Oswestry, noting the expression on"

Terence took the buff envelope and opened it.

There was a titter.

“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with

Monsieur's face grew more composed as he showed his interest in a new

He left the matron and darted back into the room.
"“I'm sure there must be something you would like me to bring you,” he"
whispered. “Don't be afraid. Any mortal thing.”

"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic

beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."

"topmost step, he said to him confidentially:"
"“I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and telling the"

Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:
"“Pooh--pooh!” said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted to the door."
“Poof--poof!” said Rippley. “Giddy old thing!”

Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"

a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.
"""And before that--?"" he suggested, politely patient."
"""Before that she was--what she still is so far's I'm concerned--Saleh"
"Harez, my adopted daughter."""

"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.
*       *       *       *       *
"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
"for the disapprobation of the Kirton mob, they held that in high scorn."
"""They'd cheer burglary, if Medland did it,"" said one."
"""Well, he wants to, pretty nearly,"" added a capitalist."
"""But the country will take a very different view. Puttock'll rub it into"
"all his people: _they_'ll not vote for him. What do you say, Coxon?"""
"""I think we shall beat him badly,"" said that gentleman, as he rose and"
went out.
"Captain Heseltine soon followed, and was surprised to see Coxon's figure"
just ahead of him as he entered the gates of Government House.
"""Hang the fellow! What does he want here?"" asked the Captain."
"Mr. Coxon asked for Lady Eynesford. When he entered, she rose with a"
newspaper in her hand.
"""What a shocking, shameful thing this is!"" she said. ""What a blessing it"
"is that the Government was beaten!"""
Coxon acquiesced in both these opinions.
"""I never thought well of him,"" continued the lady. ""Now everybody sees"
him in his true colours. And it's you we have chiefly to thank for our
"deliverance."""
"Coxon murmured a modest depreciation of his services, and said,"
"""I hope Miss Derosne is well?"""
“How strange! We must go tomorrow to the Borgia Apartment in the
Vatican.”
“Good.”
"They saw the model of an ancient galley which was in the same hall, and"
went out through the church into the garden planned by Piranesi.
"The woman showed them a very old palm, with a hole in it made by a"
hand-grenade in the year ‘49. It had remained that way more than half
"a century, and it was only a few days since the trunk of the palm had"
broken.
"From the garden they went, by a path between trees, to the bastion of"
"Paul III, a little terrace, from which they could see the Tiber at their"
"feet, and opposite the panorama of Rome and its environs, in the light"
of a beautiful spring sunshine....
"XVIII. CÆSAR BORGIA’S MOTTO, “AUT CÆSAR, AUT NIHIL”"
_THE BORGIAS_
The next day was one of the days for visiting the Borgia Apartment.
"Cæsar and Kennedy met in the Piazza di San Pietro, went into the"
"Vatican museum, and walked by a series of stairs and passageways to the"
Gallery of Inscriptions.
"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."
"“When I look at Rome this way,” murmured Laura, “I feel a pang, a pang"
of grief.”
"Rippley clasped his hands together unctuously, bowed, smiled a large"
"Italian smile. He advanced a step, and said with a strong foreign"
"accent, picking his words with slow deliberation:"
“Sir Pangboot--it has arrive to ze domestic bootler that he is
indispose sudden-ment. I am he’s friend that he have ask to take he’s
"place, vis my asseestants.... Your house shall have ze much honour in"
my hands--we have the habit to attend ze best families----”
There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.
Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:
"“I must be going mad,” he said."
Rippley bowed:
"“Sir Pangboot--me and me friends, we speak not very well ze"
Engleesh--but we much understand it well--and----”
"“Yes, yes.” Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. “Get to your"
business.... Curse it! I wonder what on earth ails Dukes.”
"As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he hesitated,"
"bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly burst a bloodvessel"
as the tragic Blotte’s moustache fell off. But Pangbutt had suddenly
remembered that he was host; and advancing into the room he turned to
the others:
"“I beg your pardon, I am late I fear.”"

"""After this is completed,"" she said matter-of-factly, ""he will be"
"finished. I hope you have planned for that."""
"Novosty glanced over, wondering what she meant. Had all the surprises"

freedom. The two million commission would mean a new beginning for him.

"SICCADAM, JOHN."
Of Boston.
"One of Captain Pound's crew. Found guilty of piracy, but pardoned."
"SIMMS, HENRY, _alias_ ""GENTLEMAN HARRY."" Pickpocket, highwayman, pirate,"
and Old Etonian.
Born in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to
"school at Eton, where he ""shewed an early inclination to vice,"" and at the"
age of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No
"Old Etonian, either then or now, would stand that kind of treatment, so"
"Simms ran away, becoming a pickpocket and later a highwayman. After"
"numerous adventures and escapes from prison, he was pressed on board"
"H.M.S. _Rye_, but he deserted his ship at Leith. After an ""affair"" at"
"Croydon, Simms was transplanted with other convicts to Maryland, in the"
"_Italian Merchant_. On the voyage he attempted, but without success, to"
raise a mutiny. On his arrival in America he was sold to the master of the
"_Two Sisters_, which was taken a few days out from Maryland by a Bayonne"
"pirate. Carried to Spain, Simms got to Oporto, and there was pressed on"
containing the necklace. It was stolen from Schloss to whom you sold
"_my_ jewels. The other old bag, stolen from me, contains the paste"
replica you had made to deceive me.”
It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or
"Stein, as you please—pulled off, some as a blind to conceal the real"
"criminal. You may have shown him how to leave no finger prints, but you"
yourself have left what is just as good—your own forehead print.
"McLear—you were right. There’s your criminal—Lynn Moulton, professional"
"fence, the brains of the thing.”"
CHAPTER XIX
THE GERM LETTER
"thought nothing of it. But this morning, when Buster, my prize"
"Pekinese, who had been with me, sitting on my lap at the time, and"
"closer to the letter even than I was, when Buster was taken suddenly"
"ill, I—well, I began to worry.”"
"She finished with a little nervous laugh, as people will to hide their"
real feelings.
"“I should like to see the dog,” remarked Kennedy simply."
"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her
face. This was serious business.
"A few minutes later she reappeared, carrying gingerly a small dog"
basket. Mrs. Blake lifted the lid. Inside was a beautiful little
"“Peke,” and it was easy to see that Buster was indeed ill."
"“Who is your doctor?” asked Craig, considering."
"“Dr. Rae Wilson, a very well-known woman physician.”"
"Kennedy nodded recognition of the name. “What does she say?” he asked,"
observing the dog narrowly.
"“We haven’t told anyone, outside, of it yet,” replied Mrs. Blake. “In"
"fact until Buster fell sick, I thought it was a hoax.”"
“You haven’t told anyone?”
“Only Reginald and my daughter Betty. Betty is frantic—not with fear
"""Eh, what?"" said the astounded Simcox."
"""It's addressed to you, Simcox,"" said the skipper blandly."
"""Why?"" asked Simcox."
The skipper shook his head impatiently.
"""I thought you'd 'ave knowed, Simcox.  You're the hambassador, and"
"you've to communicate this to 'em."""
"""Oh, go on, sir,"" said the crowd."
The skipper resumed:
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir, you'll be so good as to be so kind as to"
communicate the contents of this 'ere letter to them French of the
"wreck we don't know the name of, and tell them to clear.  For there"
ain't no reasonable grounds for supposin' this ain't a British
hisland (seeing that mostly all hislands is) and they've by comin'
"'ere first got and taken possession of the best bit of it, which"
"can't be allowed, as it's contrary to law in such case made and"
"purvided.  So you'll inform 'em it ain't goin' to be put up with, and"
"they must evacuate immejit and resume the _statues quo_----"""
"""What's that?"" asked Simcox."
"""It's Latin, you unutterable ass,"" said the skipper, with a look of"
"""Why?"""
"""Because it is a mystery, and in all probability she will endeavour to"
preserve the secret.  She must not see the Countess before we question
"her."""
"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am
"about to say, will you?"""
"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""
"""What do you mean?""  I inquired quickly."
"""I mean that when you parted from her this afternoon you were not"
"altogether good friends."""
"""You are mistaken,"" I assured him.  ""We were as good friends as ever"
"PHILLIPS, WILLIAM."
Born at Lower Shadwell.
"Boatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while"
"lying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates"
"from Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the"
"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"
"offered to him on a dish, on which lay a loaded pistol beside the copy of"
the articles.
"Found guilty and hanged in April, 1722, within the flood marks at Cape"
"Coast Castle, in his 29th year."
"PHIPS, RICHARD."
"An English soldier who deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine, in 1689."
"Wounded by a bullet in the head at Tarpaulin Cove. Taken to Boston Prison,"
where he died.
"PICKERING, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"""You left her here?"" he inquired, interrupting.  ""Yes, in this very"
room.  But it seems that a quarter of an hour later one of the servants
"entered and discovered her lying upon the door, dead."""
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Has a medical man seen her?"""
"""No.  The Countess sent for me as being one of her daughter's most"
"intimate friends, and I, in turn, sent for you."""
"""Where is the poor young lady?"""
"""In her room at the end of the corridor,"" I answered hoarsely."
"""Is there any suspicion of murder?"""
"""Apparently none whatever.  She had no visitor after I left."""
"""And no suspicion of suicide?"" he asked, with a sharp look.  ""Did you"
"part friends?"""
"""Perfectly so,"" I responded.  ""As to suicide, she had no reason, as far"
"as anyone knows, to make an attempt upon her life."""
He gave vent to an expression which sounded to me much like a grunt of
dissatisfaction.
"""Now, be perfectly frank with me, Gerald,"" he said, suddenly turning to"
"me and placing his hand upon my shoulder.  ""You loved her very dearly"
"once--was that not so?"""
I nodded.
"""At present they cannot tell,"" I responded.  ""Some deleterious substance"
"is suspected, but until she has returned to consciousness and can give"
"us some details of her sudden attack we can determine nothing."""
"""But she will recover, m'sieur?"" the Countess asked.  ""Are you certain?"""
"""The chances are in her favour, the doctors say.  They have given her a"
"drug to counteract the effect of the poison."""
"""Poison!  Was she poisoned?"" gasped the Countess."
"""Poison is suspected,"" I answered quietly.  ""But calm yourself, madame."
"The truth will be discovered in due course."""
"""I care nothing so long as Yolande is given back to me!"" the distressed"
"woman cried.  ""Was it your English friend who discovered the truth?"""
"""Yes,"" I replied.  ""He is one of the cleverest men in Paris."""
"""And to him my poor Yolande will owe her life?"""
"""Yes, to him."""
"""And to you also, m'sieur?  You have done your utmost for us, and I"
"thank you warmly for it all."""
"""Madame,"" I said earnestly, ""I have done only what a man should do.  You"
"sought my assistance, and I have given it, because--"""
"""Because of what?"" she inquired sharply the instant I paused."
"""Because I once loved her,"" I responded with perfect frankness."
"brutality, his masculinity, his greedy hands, his looks--she sniffed at"
all this and was excited by it. She had grown so unnatural that her sexual
needs were satisfied by keeping this man at a distance. The Torsen type no
"doubt lies in her solitary bed at night, reveling in the sensation that in"
another house a man lies writhing for her.
"But her friend, the actor? He was in no sense the other's equal. There was"
"nothing of the bull in him, nothing of action, only the braggadocio of the"
theater....
*       *       *       *       *
"Here am I, growing small and petty with this life. I question Solem about"
the accident. We are alone together in the woodshed.
Why had he lied and said the Dane wanted to climb the Blue Peak that
unfortunate Sunday morning?
"Solem looked at me, pretending not to understand."
I repeated my question.
Solem denied he had said any such thing.
"""I heard you,"" I said."
"""No, you didn't,"" he said."
A pause.
"Suddenly he dropped to the floor of the shed, convulsed, without shape, an"
outline merely; a few minutes passed before he got up again. When he was
last he stood still before her.
"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.
The Girl turned upon him with eyes flashing and retorted:
"""Well, it's my throat, ain't it?"""
"""Well I'll be!--"" The Sheriff's sentence was left unfinished, for Nick,"
"quickly pulling him to one side, whispered:"
"""Say, Rance, the Girl's cut up because she vouched for 'im. Don't rub it"
"in."""
"Notwithstanding, Rance, to the Girl's query of ""How did this Nina"
"Micheltoreña know it?"" took a keen delight in telling her:"
"""She's his girl."""
"""His girl?"" repeated the Girl, mechanically."
"""Yes. She gave us his picture,"" went on Rance; and taking the photograph"
"out of his pocket, he added maliciously, ""with love written on the back"
"of it."""
"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement
"of pain she threw it upon the floor, crying out bitterly:"
"""Nina Micheltoreña! Nina Micheltoreña!"" Turning to Ashby with an abrupt"
"change of manner she said contritely: ""I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, I vouched"
"for 'im."""
The Wells Fargo Agent softened at the note in the Girl's voice; he was
about to utter some comforting words to her when suddenly she spoke
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."
CHAPTER XXII
"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room
"ever played.  The Chopin polonaise in A flat, that song of revolution,"
"which had always seemed so unattainable, went as if her fingers were"
"being worked for her.  When she had finished, Monsieur Harmost, bending"
"forward, lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it.  She felt the"
"scrub of his little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh"
of satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"
"inspiration of your--master!"""
Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.
"The old man drew himself up.  ""Monsieur,"" he said, ""you are certainly"
"drunk."""
"Gyp slipped between, right up to those outstretched hands till she could"
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""
"goin'."""
"He bowed her out of the room, and then, snatching up his hat and cane"
"with very visible annoyance, included the others in a curt nod of"
farewell and made off himself.
He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have
paused there.
"""You won't forget me, will you?"" she heard him ask eagerly from behind"
her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.
"""We're going to talk business for a few minutes,"" he told her, ""and then"
get everything settled in writing--to keep you safe.
"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."
[Illustration]
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""

"""Ah, no doubt!  I suspected him and watched.  It was evident that he"
"came to my salon in order to meet her."""
"""To meet Sibyl!  Why?"""
"""That I cannot tell."""
"""But I think, Baronne, we may be both agreed upon one point."""
"""And that is?"""
"""That the man who now calls himself Rodolphe Wolf is here in Paris with"
"some secret motive."""
"""I am entirely in accord, m'sieur--quite.  Some steps must at once be"
"taken to ascertain that man's motives."""

"""How can we tell?  You know better than myself whether she ever knows"
"any secrets of the Embassy."""
"""She knows nothing,--of that I am absolutely convinced,"" I responded."
"""Her father is devoted to her; but, nevertheless, he is one of those"
"strict diplomatists who do not believe in trusting women with secrets."""
"""Yet Wolf had a distinct object in making a good impression upon her,"""
she said reflectively.
"He set his who?-where? robot for ""Rocket Physicist"" and ""Genius Class."""
"While it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief"
message:
Dear Fellow Scientist:
A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's
future in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are
available. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the
Thinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected
the professional men. Now both times are past. May they never
"return! I would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock"
"sharp, Thinkers' Foundation I."
Jorj Helmuth
Meanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced
"through them, hesitated at the name ""Willard Farquar,"" looked at the"
"sleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and"
plugged in the steno-robot.
The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.
"""The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,"" a clear feminine voice"
"announced. ""He has the general staff with him."""
"""Martian peace to him,"" Jorj Helmuth said. ""Tell him I'll be down in a"
"few minutes."""

One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.

SAN BLAS WOMAN IN DAILY GARB]
"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"
"civilization, the exclusion of aliens is the result of well-founded"
political reasons. Their respected traditions are a long record of proud
independence; they have maintained the purity of their race and enjoyed
freely for hundreds of years every inch of their territory. They feel
that the day the negro or the white man acquires a foothold in their
"midst these privileges will become a thing of the past. This is why,"
"Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy, and then the two boys"
hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys
"into their care,” Ned said, as they hustled along, “so I’m afraid"
they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""
XIV
The human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things. Gyp
never really believed that Daphne Wing was of the past.  Her sceptical
instinct told her that what Fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very
different from what he would do under stress of opportunity carefully put
together in the room where Yolande was lying.
"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""
"Thus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been"
confined in an asylum for lunatics.
NEAL.
A fisherman of Cork.
"Mutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under"
"the leadership of Philip Roche, murdered the captain and many of the crew"
and became a pirate.
"NEFF, WILLIAM."
"Born at Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1667."
"A soldier, one of the guard at Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine. Deserted in"
1689 and went to sea with the pirate Captain Pound.
"NELSON, CAPTAIN."
"Born on Prince Edward Island, where his father had a grant of land for"
"services rendered in the American war. He was a wealthy man, a member of"
the Council and a Colonel of the Militia. In order to set his son up in
"life he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young"
"Nelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to"
Halifax with cargoes of potatoes and fruit. He seems to have liked these
"trips in which he combined business with pleasure, for we learn that on"
"these visits to Halifax he ""was very wild, and drank and intrigued with"
"the girls in an extravagant manner."" Getting into disgrace on Prince"
every hut and tent was brilliantly illuminated. Multitudes of dazzling
stars appeared and disappeared.
We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in
the hut.
"We paraded, the roll was called, and as the day began to dawn we marched"
off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""
"The French did not sing, but we, who were escaping destruction, passed"
from one song to another:
"""I don't want to fight the Germans,"
"I don't want to go to war,"
"I'd sooner be in London,"
"Dear old dirty London."""

"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”
religious music.
"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange
"thing about these men, namely, that they painted themselves to others"
worse than they actually were.  A man who has good in him does not mind
sometimes showing his worse nature.

"When all these people were gathered round the teacher, then the reading"
of the newspaper would begin.
"""Well, what does the newspaper discuss to-day?  Is there any"
"feuilleton?"""
"""No,"" the teacher informs him."
"""Your publisher seems greedy ... but is there any leader?"""
"""There is one to-day....  It appears to be by Gulyaeff."""
"""Aha!  Come, out with it.  He writes cleverly, the rascal."""

"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"

For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"

"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.

Of Gloucestershire.

with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"

"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"

Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."

Travers seized his arm. His eyes shone with a painful excitement.

"must!"""
Nicholson freed himself resolutely from the clinging hands.

glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.

pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."
"""I'll bet you grew pretty ones on the cheeks of those French girls,"" he"
chuckled.

"In the rules which follow, the basis adopted is ""Cutter's Rules for"
"a Dictionary Catalogue,""[49] prepared for library cataloguing. Such"
"portion as applies to book indexing has been freely drawn upon, adapted"
and added to from the present writer's experience.
ARRANGEMENT
"When, under a single entry, there are both subject-references and"
"references by folios only, place the folio-references together at the"
"end of the entry, following the subject-references."
"Arrange entries according to the English alphabet, whatever the order"
of the alphabet in which a foreign name might have been entered in its
original language.
"Arrange German names spelled with the vowels ä, ö, ü as if spelled ae,"
"oe, ue, but retain the form employed by the author."
"When the same word serves for several kinds of entries, the order"
"should be as follows: person, place, subject, title: e.g., (1) _Brown,"
G. F._ (person). (2) _Brown Village_ (place). (3) _Brown-tail Moth_
"(subject). (4) _Brown Family, the_ (title)."
"Forenames precede surnames: e.g., _Francis I_ precedes _Francis,"
Charles_.
CHAPTER I
_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"
"a year ago. It never came back. I sent another ship, with two good men"
"comes after death!"""
"But he could not make his family laugh at this tale, either. His wife"
stood still; her face was beautiful.
"""So you're leaving now,"" was all she said."
Mr. Brede's porter came out with his luggage; he had stayed at the farm
for these three days in order to be at hand.
"Then the manufacturer walked down through the field, accompanied by his"
wife and children.
I don't know--this man with his good humor and kindliness and money and
"everything, fond of his children, all in all to his wife--"
Was he really everything to his wife?
"The first evening he wasted time on a party, and every night he wasted"
time in snoring. And so the three days and nights went by....

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in
"the field, men and women are at work; they go thinly clad and bareheaded,"
and call to one another and laugh; sometimes they drink from a bucket of
"whey, then set to work again. There is the familiar fragrance of hay,"
"which penetrates my senses like a song of home, drawing me home, home,"
"""They aren't much closer to success,"" offered Regin Naylo. ""And we're"
"wasting time."""
"""You think so?"""
"""We both think so,"" Faren Twill said firmly."
"""Oh?"" Viggon Sarri looked at them in surprise. ""Then maybe I have the"
"wrong idea. Let me hear your suggestions."""
"Twill and Naylo looked at one another, fencing with their eyes. Finally"
"Twill nodded and said, ""You say it, Regin."""
"""It's already been said."" Regin Naylo looked pointedly at Linus Brein."
"""A day or so ago you claimed that you'd picked up some primitive"
infrawave emission that looked as though someone might be trying to
"develop a detecting and ranging device."""
"""Yes."""
"""Then it is my contention that any moves we make against this race"
should be made before anybody down there gets such a detector and
"ranger working."""
"""Why?"" demanded Viggon Sarri."
"Regin Naylo looked at his commander. ""We're losing a technical"
advantage. Whether we go in with a benign and peaceful-looking air and
"show them how big and fast we are, or whether we plunge in and hit 'em"
"with every battery we've got and reduce 'em to submission, we've got to"
do it before anybody succeeds in making an infrawave space detector.
"here. The _oyabun's _people may be here by then. If they are not, we"
"will be."""
"""But if he has been kidnapped,"" Nogami's brow furrowed as he studied"
"his cigar, its ash still growing, ""then there could be a problem with"
"the transaction. Who do you suppose would want him, besides the Tokyo"
"_oyabun_?"""
"""That I could not speculate upon. The KGB seems to have a great"
interest in his activities. Perhaps they are guarding him in some more
"secure place. Or perhaps something else has happened."" He bowed. ""Again"
you must forgive me for this rude intrusion. It is important for you to
be aware that the situation is not resolved. That you still have a
"chance to save yourself."""
"""The CEO will receive his hundred million, if there is no interference."
"That much I have already arranged for. When that is completed, I will"
"consider my responsibilities discharged."""
"""Your responsibilities will never be discharged, Nogami-san. _Giri"
"_lasts forever."" His voice was cutting. ""The sooner you realize that,"
"the better."""
"""After tomorrow, it will be over, Sato-sama."" He stretched out his arm"
and tapped the inch-long ash into a trash basket beside the desk.
"""Tomorrow,"" Jiro Sato bowed, ""it only begins."""

laughing.
“And why so?” asked Cæsar.
“Because we talk politics and sometimes they ask me for a few

"“Your wife must have a lively temper,...” said Cæsar."
"“Yes, an unhappy disposition; good, awfully good; but very"
superstitious. Christianity has produced nothing but superstitions.”
"“Giovanni Battista is a pagan, as his wife well says,” asserted Kennedy."
“What superstitions has your wife?” asked Cæsar.
“All of them. Romans are very superstitious and my wife is a Roman. If
"you see a hunchback, it is good luck; if you see three, then your luck"
is magnificent and you have to swallow your saliva three times; on the
"other hand, if you see a humpbacked woman it is a bad omen and you must"
spit on the ground to keep away the _jettatura_. Three priests together
"is a very good sign. We ought all to get along very well in Rome,"
because we see three and up to thirty priests together.”
"“A spider is also very significant,” said Kennedy; “in the morning it is"
"of bad augury, and in the evening good.”"
“And at noon?” asked Cæsar.
"“At noon,” answered Lanza, laughing, “it means nothing to speak of. But"

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd

thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl

Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."

CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.

"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"

"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""

"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
tricks were the outcome of years of concentrated effort and constant
"exercise, and being moved by the Grace of God, he desired to offer the"
best thing he had to give to the Lord of Life. His best was his skill.
"He lived by it. Shown in the streets and the play places, it won for"
him his daily bread. His work was to give men amusement in their hours
of recreation by an exhibition of his feats of strength and
"nimbleness. Could this, his one talent, be consecrated and devoted to"
"God? So he considered, and humbly sought the sanctuary, and there"
before the Presence he performed his fantastic tricks which had cost
him years of endeavour. The story is a parable which men have not been
"slow to read, and it has become the theme of the musician and artist."
Shall I offend my fellow-writers if I repeat it here in this

THE FIRES OF MOLOCH
“_There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets._”
Every three months with unfailing regularity small paragraphs appear
in the daily papers headed “RECORD LOW BIRTH-RATE.” Some figures
“I am trying to make use of my relationship to Cardinal Fort? Why
shouldn’t I?”
“You admit it?”
"“Yes, I admit it. People are such imbeciles that they think it is an"
honour to have a Cardinal in the family; I take advantage of this stupid
"idea, although I do not share it, because for me a Cardinal is merely an"
"object of curiosity, an object for an archeological museum....”"
"Cæsar paused, because the monk’s countenance was growing dark. In the"
"twilight of his pallid face, his nose looked like a comet portending"
some public calamity.
“Poor wretch!” murmured the monk. “You do not know what you are saying.
You are blaspheming. You are offending God.” “Do you really believe that
"God has any relation to my uncle?” asked Cæsar, paying more attention"
to his toast than to his visitor.
And then he added:
“The truth is that it would be extravagant behaviour on the part of
God.”
"The monk looked at Cæsar with terrible eyes. Those grey eyes of his,"
"under their long, black, thick brows, shot lightning."
“Poor wretch!” repeated the monk. “You ought to have more respect for
things above you.”
Cæsar arose.
"“No, French.”"
"“Ah, then, you needn’t be surprised. A Frenchman has no obligation to"
understand anything that’s not French.”
“Nevertheless he was an intelligent man.”
“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"
thing among a lot of good ones?”
"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"
"conversation, was indignant at Cæsar’s irreverent ideas. He asked him"
"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"
"dates, and numbers. Then he asserted that all artistic things of great"
"merit were German: Greece. Rome, Gothic architecture, the Italian"
"Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, Velázquez, all German."
"The snub-nosed young person, with his cape and his green hat with its"
"cock-feather, did not let a mouse escape from his German mouse-trap."
"The data of the befeathered German were too much for Cæsar, and he took"
his leave of the painters.
"""I well remember it,"" he went on.  ""I quite recollect how, on one"
"occasion, you came over to London, and while dining together at Jimmy's"
"you told me of your infatuation, and showed me her photograph.  Do you"
"remember the night when you told me of your engagement to her?"""
"""Perfectly."""
"""And as time went on you suddenly dropped her--for what reason I know"
"not.  We are pals, but I have never attempted to pry into your affairs."
"If she really loved you, it must have been a hard blow for her when she"
"heard that you had forsaken her for Edith Austin."""
"""You reproach me,"" I said.  ""But you do not know the whole truth, my"
"dear fellow.  I discovered that Yolande possessed a second lover."""
"He nodded slowly, with pursed lips."
"""And that was the reason of your parting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""The sole reason?"""
"""The sole reason."""
"""And you have no suspicion that she may have committed suicide because"
"of her love for you?  Such things are not uncommon, remember, with girls"
"of a certain temperament."""
"""If she has committed suicide, it is not on my account,"" I responded in"
a hard voice.
find the tiger alternating with the monkey. There the dominant note on
"the walls is the patriotic note, insults to politicians, calling them"
"assassins and thieves, and also sentiments of revenge expressed by"
"an _‘A mort Dupin!’_ or _‘A mort Duval!’_ Moreover, there is a great"
enthusiasm for the guillotine.”
“And Madrid?”
"“Madrid is at heart a rude, moral town with little imagination, and"
the epigraphs on the walls and benches are primitive.”
“And in Rome what do you find?”
"“Here one finds a mixture of pornography, romanticism, and politics."
"A heart pierced by an arrow and poetic phrases, alternate with some"
enormous piece of filthiness and with hurrahs for Anarchy or for the
_‘Papa-re.’_”
“Well done!” said Kennedy; “I can see that the branch of epigraphy you
practise amounts to something. It should be systematized and given a
name.”
“What do you think we should name it? Wallography?”
“Very good.”
“And one of these fine days we can systematize it. Now we might go and
get dinner.”
"They took a tram which was coming back from St. Paul’s beyond the Walls,"
and returned to the heart of the city.
"and named Cortés; the other, large, ordinary, fleshy, and coarse, seemed"
rather a bully.
"Giovanni Battista was not able to be long outside the workshop, no doubt"
"because his conscience troubled him, and though with difficulty, he got"
"up and left. Kennedy, Cæsar, and the two Spaniards went toward the"
"Piazza, del Campidoglio, and Buonacossi marched off in the opposite"
direction.
"On reaching the Via Nazionale, Kennedy took his leave and Cæsar"
"remained with the two Spaniards. The red, fleshy one, who had the air of"
"a bully, started in to make fun of the Italians, and to mimic their bows"
and salutes; then he said that he had an engagement with a woman and
made haste to take his leave.
"When he had gone, the grave Spaniard with the sour face, said to Cæsar:"
“That chap is like the dandies here; that’s why he imitates them so
well.”
Afterwards Cortés talked about his studies in painting; he didn’t get
"on well, he had no money, and anyway Rome didn’t please him at all."
"Everything seemed wrong to him, absurd, ridiculous."
"Cæsar, after he had said good-bye to him, murmured: “The truth is that"
we Spaniards are impossible people.”
XVI. THE PORTRAIT OF A POPE
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."
"“Paris has a vulgar, cruel taste; in the Frenchman of the people you"
Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his

He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome

"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."

"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a

"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"

Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America

launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast

Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
adorably red. There was a new and brilliant light in her eye; and after
"one curiously comprehensive glance at the company, she turned about to"
"look for her companion, La Giralda, who presently cantered up on a"
"lumbering Estramenian gelding. La Giralda sat astride as before, her"
"lower limbs, so far as these were apparent, being closely clad in"
"leather, a loose skirt over them preserving in part the appearance of"
sex.
Rollo was dumb with sheer astonishment. He could only gaze at the
"flushed cheek, the tingling electric glances, the air completely"
unconscious and innocent of the girl before him.

"imagined you were safe at the Convent of the Holy Innocents!"""

"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
"""This idea is hopelessly haywire,"" Wilson said unhappily."
"""It sure is,"" said Space-Tech Maury Allison. ""But everything is, at"

"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""

their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.

"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"

"screeching gargoyles, instead, devoted all their efforts to merely"
hurling their attenuated bodies on the two men as though they wished
to capture them alive.
"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"
attackers opened his tiny mouth and piped a signal. The ring of
weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"

The numbing shock from the tubes left the Earthmen's bodies almost
paralyzed for a time; but their brains were unfogged enough for them

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"
"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.

Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust
"controls, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually"
"he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting."

of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.

_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”
"“He found it bad, no doubt.”"
“Very bad?”
“Was this Stendhal English?”

"He would allow her a very free hand, so long as she did not attack"
the Germans or their allies or put in any false news about military
"or naval successes of the foes of Central Europe. She might, for"
"instance, dilate on the cruel manner in which the Woman Suffragists"
had been persecuted in England; give a description of forcible
"listening to every word--""very curious!"""
"""Did you feel any strange sensation on the left side of your neck"
"beneath the ear, or upon your lower lip?"" inquired Deane earnestly."
"She reflected for a moment, then said:"
"""Now that I remember, there was a curious numbness of my lip."""
"""Followed immediately by unconsciousness?"""
"""Yes, almost immediately."""
"The doctors exchanged glances, which showed that the mark upon the lip"
was the chief enigma of the situation.
"Trepard glanced at his watch, dissolved yet another pillule of hydrated"
"peroxide of iron, and handed her the draught to swallow.  The antidote"
had acted almost like magic.

"had left?"" repeated Deane, as though not yet satisfied."
"""Absolutely."""
"Dick Deane turned his eyes full upon me, and I divined his thoughts.  He"
was reflecting upon the conversation held between us before we entered
that room.  He was endeavouring to worm from her some clue to her
secret.

All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little man
shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.
"“I was saying,” shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,"
“that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age for
himself.”
The old baronet shook his head:
“The man who what?”
Fosse licked his lips sullenly:
"“The man who doesn’t play whist,” shrieked Fosse, reddening miserably."
“What about him?” asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.
"“Lays up a sad old age for himself,” screamed the miserable little man."
The old gentleman knit his brows:
“A reformed rake?” he asked testily....
But attention was diverted from the fussy little minor critic’s despair
by the murmur of admiration which greeted the entrance into the room
of a beautiful woman to whom Quogge Myre was paying aggressively
marked court as the announcement of her name called the regard of
the assembled guests to her arrival. Myre was ever for stealing the
lime-light. He was a born filcher of honour. But the beauty’s calm

AIR-RAIDS
"It was a warm, sunny afternoon. About a dozen of us were pitching a"
"marquee in leisurely fashion, when suddenly there was a shout of ""Fritz"
"up!"""
"We gazed at the sky, and, after searching for a while, saw a tiny white"
"speck moving slowly across the blue at an immense height. Then, at some"
"distance from it, a small white puff, like a little ball of cotton-wool,"
appeared. A few seconds passed and we heard a faint pop. More puffs
"appeared around the moving speck, each one followed by a pop. All at"
"once, behind us, a bright tongue of flame flashed out above a group of"
"bushes. There was a sharp report and a whizzing, rustling noise that"
died down gradually. Then another puff and another pop. The bright
flames flashed out again in rapid succession. The little speck moved on
and on. Grouped closely round it were compact little balls of
"cotton-wool, but trailing behind were thin wisps and semi-transparent"
whitish blurs. Above a belt of trees in the distance we observed a

Rollo kissed first and made up his mind to it some time after.
Consequently Concha was taken absolutely by surprise. She uttered a
little cry and stepped back indignantly into the lighted room where the
spare muskets were piled.
"But again Rollo was before her. If he had attempted to make love, she"
"would have scathed him with the soundest indignation, based on"
"considerations of time, place, and personality."
But the young Scot gave her no opportunity. In a moment he had again
become her superior officer.
"""Take your piece,"" he said, with an air of assured command, ""together"
"with sufficient ammunition, and post yourself at the little staircase"
window over the great door looking towards the town. If you see any one
"approaching, do not hesitate to fire. Good-bye. God bless you! I will"
"see you again on my rounds!"""
And Rollo passed on his way.
"Then with a curious constraint upon her tongue, and on her spirit a new"
and delightful feeling that she could do no other than as she was
"bidden, Concha found herself, with loaded musket and pistol, obediently"
taking her place in the general defence of the palace.

killed the Revolution. The _chic_ put an end to the Revolution. And
"now everything is coming back; enthusiasm for the aristocracy, for the"
Church; the cult of kings. People look backward and the Revolutionary
movement is paralysed. The people that irritate me most are those
"esthetes of the Ruskin school, for whom everything is religious: having"
"money, buying jewels, blowing one’s nose... everything is religious."
"Vulgar creatures, lackeys that they are!”"
"“My brother is a demagogue,” said Laura ironically."
"“Yes,” added Kennedy; “he doesn’t like categories.”"
“But each thing has its value whether he likes it or not.”
"“I do not deny different values, or even categories. There are things of"
"great value in life; some natural, like youth, beauty, strength;"
"others more artificial, like money, social position; but this idea of"
"distinction, of aristocratic fineness, is a farce. It is a literary"
behind.
These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands
"of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or"
cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on
"the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,"
"rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic"
"animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,"
"some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird"
"with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in"
themselves.
The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs
"for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In"
"we crowd with the joyful saddle-bags, into the wooden carriage with its"
many seats.
"And, wonder of wonders, punctually to the second, off we go, out of"
Cagliari. En route again.
IV.
MANDAS.
"The coach was fairly full of people, returning from market. On these"
railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments. They
"are left open, so that one sees everybody, as down a room. The"
"attractive saddle-bags, _bercole_, were disposed anywhere, and the bulk"
"Aubrey at the mantelpiece, gazing at himself in the mirror, said simply:"
“Bosh!”
"“Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it, eh?” said"
"Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair."
"Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the situation"
with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:
"“And a rippin’ dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one’s self being wrangled"
about from one end of the country to the other----”
Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:
"“Ah!” said he, “and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful"
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!”
Rippley laughed drily:
"“No, no, Aubrey, old man--that wouldn’t have suited you at all. You"
wouldn’t have lasted at it for a fortnight.”
Lovegood smiled:
"“We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,” he said in"
his big deep voice: “We shall be tearing him to pieces in magazine
articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the lower journalism
to snarl at before the year is out.... The failures are always
suspicious of popularity.”
"Aubrey turned to the mirror again, and said “Bosh!”"

IV. VERITAS FILIA TEMPORIS
"_Quid est veritas?_--Platonism, or transcendental idealism--Naturalism,"
or transcendental realism--The idea of progress--Progress and truth:
evolutionism--Pragmatism--Croce's new pragmatism--The immanence of
value--The actuality of Truth--Truth as history: the function of error
and of evil--The foundations of Croce's thought.
"There is one problem in the history of human thought, which, however"
conscious we might be of the multiplicity and historical contingency
"of philosophical problems, yet can appear to us as the ultimate or"
"central one, if only because it is an abstract interrogation describing"
"the attitude of the philosopher, and to which every concrete logical"
"research, every act of thought, can be reduced. It is Pilate's"
question: _Quid est veritas?_ What is truth?
"The question itself has no definite meaning, until it receives from the"
"individual thinker a definite content, which is history or experience,"
and the infinite variety of the answers it has received is due to the
infinite variability of that content. But at all times man has been
ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS
"In general, a noun or a substantive phrase should be selected for the"
"heading, but when an adjective forms part of a name or well-known"
"term, the entry should include it: e.g., _Alimentary canal, hereditary"
"genius, perpetual motion_, etc."
SUBJECT-MATTER
It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing subject-matter
"as definitely as has already been done with names, places, etc. The"
judgment of the indexer and his analytical skill will be called fully
"into play. The effort should be to express in the index, in the"
"clearest yet briefest form, the _idea_ which the author has amplified"
"in his text. As an aid to the nature and form of the entries, a page of"
"text is shown on the opposite page, and the entries which would appear"
"in the index from this page, are given below. This is what would be"
considered as a medium full index:
"Bressani, Joseph, tortured by Iroquois, 73; life spared by Iroquois,"
"73; sent to Fort Orange, 73; ransomed by Dutch, 73; sent to Rochelle,"
73.
"Dutch, the, ransom Bressani, 73."
"Indian Torture, See _Torture, Indian_."
"Iroquois Indians, the, torture Bressani, 73; spare Bressani's"
"life, 73."
"prevents re-absorption, and mechanically excites peristaltic action, as"
"Magnesium Sulphate, etc."
"CATHARTIC SIMPLE.--A medicine that is more active then a laxative, but"
is accompanied by some griping; it causes active peristalsis and larger
"and softer stools than laxatives, as Rhubarb, Aloes, etc."
"CAUSTIC.--A medicine or agent used to destroy living tissue, as Caustic"
"Potash, Silver Nitrate, etc."
"CAUTERY.--An agent used to sear or burn living tissue, with a cautery or"
"a caustic, as a hot iron or Nitric Acid, etc."
CAUTERY ACTUAL.--A metal instrument heated by an electric current or by
"flame, used to destroy bone or muscular tissue or for producing"
"counter-irritation, much preferred to setons in diseases of the bones"
"especially of their joints, as in Bone Spavin, Ringbone, etc., also"
valuable in the treatment of sprained tendons. The methods used are
either puncture or line firing.
"CAUTERY POTENTIAL.--A chemical used for destroying or cauterizing flesh,"
"as Nitric Acid, etc."
"CHALYBEATE.--A medicine containing iron, as Tincture Chlorid of Iron."
"CONDIMENT.--A medicine used to improve palatability of food, as"
"Fenugreek, Aniseed, Salt, Pepper, etc."
CONSERVATIVE.--A medicine or substance used for the preservation of
"other medicines without loss, as Alcohol, Honey, etc."
"CONSTRINGENT.--A medicine which causes contraction of organic tissues,"
COPYRIGHT
On the reverse of the title-page is ordinarily placed the copyright
"notice of the volume,[46] usually a little above the center, set in"
"caps and small caps, or in small caps alone. At the foot of this same"
page the printer usually places his imprint.[47]
DEDICATION
"The dedication is a page set in the monumental style, generally in"
"small capitals. This must always be a right-hand page, and the reverse"
must always be blank.
PREFACE
Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size of type as the body. If
"it is written by some one other than the author, it is frequently set"
in italic to mark the distinction. This is particularly true in case
the book contains an introduction as well. If the preface is of unusual
"importance, it is sometimes customary to have it set in type one size"
"larger than the body, or double-leaded."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the preface and before the list of illustrations comes the
"contents, occupying whatever number of pages may be necessary. The"
style of its composition is dependent entirely upon the subject-matter
and the typographical arrangement of the volume.
"Bilkins entered with the tray, wishing us a happy new year. Outside the"
"whistles were beginning to blow. After we had pledged each other, and"
"drunk to 1919, the Mater, a light of challenge in her eyes, looked at me"
and gave another toast:
"""To a cruise and an adventure, Jack!"""
"""To romance,"" Dad cried, gallantly raising her fingers to his lips."
"There was no use being a wet blanket, so with a laugh I said:"
"""To adventure and romance!--Mater, if they're still on earth I'll bring"
"them home to you!"""
"I knew it was a very silly toast, but let it go to please them--for why"
disillusion those who believe in the actuality of nonexistence?
CHAPTER II
THE MYSTERIOUS MONSIEUR
"Ten days later Tommy and I--and Bilkins, whom I had begged of my father"
"at the eleventh hour--stepped off the train at Miami, stretched our arms"
"and breathed deep breaths of balmy air. Gates, his ruddy face an augury"
"of good cheer, was there to meet us, and as he started off well laden"
"with a portion of our bags, Tommy whispered:"
"""Reminds me of the old chap in that picture 'The Fisherman's Daughter'!"""
TOXICOLOGY.--Dogs and cats are especially susceptible to the action of
"carbolic acid, therefore great care must be exercised when washing,"
"especially cats, with any preparation containing carbolic acid."
Disinfecting and deodorizing cat’s quarters with any preparation
containing carbolic acid makes them sick.
ANTIDOTE.--Sulphates of soda or magnesia. Atropine sulphate
hypodermically is a very valuable antidote. Alcohol and vinegar have
"been used with good results, both internally and externally."
ACIDUM SALICYLICUM--SALICYLIC ACID
"An organic acid, existing naturally in combination in various plants,"
but largely prepared synthetically from carbolic acid.
DERIVATION.--Made by passing carbonic dioxide through sodium carbolate
at a temperature of 428° F. (220° C.). 2 NaC₆H₅O (sodium carbolate) +
CO₂ = Na₂C₇H₄O₃ (sodium salicylate) + C₆H₆O (phenol). Sodium salicylate
is treated with hydrochloric acid when salicylic acid is precipitated.
"PROPERTIES.--Light, fine, white, needle-shaped crystals, odorless,"
"having a sweetish, afterwards acrid taste; permanent in air. Soluble in"
"alcohol, ether and hot water; borax increases its solubility."
"DOSE.--Horses, 2 to 6 drs.; cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.; should be given well diluted;"
"large doses are recommended for fevers, but smaller doses more often"
repeated in rheumatism.

the five thousand tons vessel literally cut the luckless submarine in
twain. For a brief instant the lieutenant caught sight of the
"after-portion of the ""U"" boat, as, rendered buoyant by the trapped"
"air, it drifted past. Then amidst a smother of foam and oil the"
wreckage vanished.

"carpenter, who immediately after the impact had hurried below to see"
"if any plates had been ""started."""
A little later in the afternoon several of the ward-room officers
"were enjoying their cups of tea and biscuits, when the"
staff-paymaster entered.
"""Well, Staggles, what's the shortage?"" asked the commander"
facetiously.
"The accountant officer eyed his tormentor reproachfully, as if that"
officer were responsible for his former discomfiture.
"""One pound three shillings and threepence--and two tins of condensed"
"milk,"" he announced stiffly. ""According to paragraph 445 of the"
Admiralty Instructions there will have to be two separate reports on
"the shortage."""
'Therefore I refuse to regard as hopeless the idea of an
"American-Anglo-Japanese alliance, guaranteeing the peaceful development"
of the vast resources of the Far East. Such an alliance exists
"essentially now--an alliance springing from cognate ideas, wishes,"
purposes and principles. This is the best possible foundation for that
formal compact which the evolution of industry and commerce seems to me
unmistakably to foreshadow.'

NOTE TO DIALOGUE V.
"Since the bulk of the present work went to press, I came across the"
following communication printed in the _Outlook_. I take the liberty of
"subjoining it herewith, without any vain intention of flaunting the"
virtues of my countrymen.--K.S.
JAPANESE CHARACTER
_To the Editor of the_ OUTLOOK
"SIR,--I have received during the last few weeks letters bearing such"
eloquent testimony to the nobility of Japanese character that I am
sending you some extracts in the hope of your publishing them. The
"letters are from a friend of mine, who with her husband has lived in"
"Yokohama for many years, and can therefore speak with considerable"
authority. The first extract is about the soldiers themselves--
"Mine you know is a busy life, and I found work among the military"
"were so, why should we make the least objection? But in the hypothesis"
that the introduction of civilisation has in view neither amelioration
"of the condition of the natives nor progress of commerce and industry,"
we might then conceive a sort of suspicion. Supposing that you augment
"the garrisons, the fortifications, the naval forces, one would see in it"
nothing but an expansion of your military power and not an introduction
of civilisation in the sense understood in France. Even in that case we
"would not raise objections, unless it were done with a view to menace"
us; but here I shall offer you a suggestion. Is it really worth your
while to develop there incessantly your military and naval forces in
order to oppose Japan? Would not the enterprise be rather costly? Would
it not be infinitely better to employ your energy in cultivating a good
understanding between your country and ours instead of rivalling each
other by crossing armaments?

THE AUSTRALIAN QUESTION[1]
AN INTERVIEW
Baron Suyematsu gave a _Daily News_ representative his opinion of the
"'Spectre of Japan' as conceived by many Europeans. The Japanese Baron, a"
"burly, cheerful man, laughed heartily as he dealt with the alarmist"
fears of the 'Yellow Peril.'
it has notable antiseptic and antipyretic effects. Useful in carbolic
"acid poisoning, alcohol, or alcoholic liquors, act as a chemical"
antidote besides overcoming the shock produced by the acid. It may also
be used locally for carbolic acid burns.
The effects of alcohol are noticed in ten or fifteen minutes after
"administration and will be shown by a better condition of the pulse, the"
"weak pulse becoming stronger and firmer; the quick pulse slower, the"
"breathing becomes more natural, eyes brighten up and in fact a general"
improvement is shown.
Externally alcohol is used alone as a strengthening application to weak
"tendons and muscles; or after a race, is used to rub on the legs,"
"combined with other drugs as a liniment, as alcohol, soap-liniment and"
witch hazel; can be used in surgery as an antiseptic.
To toughen the skin of tender or thin skinned horses who gall or chafe
"easily under the collar and saddle, alcohol will be found a most"
satisfactory application.
ALOE BARBADENSIS--BARBADOES ALOES
"The thickened juice of the leaves of Aloe vera, Linn., Aloe chinensis,"
"Bak., and probably other species, evaporated to dryness."
HABITAT.--The Barbadoes Island.
"PROPERTIES.--In hard masses, orange, brown, opaque, translucent on the"
USES.--Tartar emetic is too mild as an emetic in poison cases. In asthma
of dogs it may be used in from ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ grain doses to relax spasm
and promote secretion. For horses its most valuable use is to expel the
"common round worms from the intestines, for which it is very"
efficacious; given in two drachm doses once or twice daily in the feed
"for four to six days, or one-half ounce dissolved in water is given on"
an empty stomach followed by a full dose of linseed oil.
ANTIPYRINA--ANTIPYRIN
"Phenyl-hydrazine is acted upon by aceto-acetic ether, when"
"phenyl-monomethyl-pyrazolon, ethyl alcohol and water results."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, odorless, scaly crystals, of a bitterish taste."
"Soluble in water, ether and chloroform."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.;"
"dogs, 5 to 20 grs."
"ACTIONS.--Powerful antipyretic, anodyne and local anesthetic,"
"antiseptic, cardiac depressant; it reduces temperature very quickly,"
usually within half an hour and the effects continue two or more hours.
"It can be administered by the mouth, hypodermically or intertracheally;"
"as an antiseptic it diminishes oxidation, and promotes heat loss by"
"dilating the cutaneous vessels, but more probably by depressing the"
activity of the calorifacient centers.
"""There is no skepticism so offensive as that which doubts the facts of"
honest and careful observation; no Infidelity so gross as that which
"disbelieves the deductions of competent and unbiased judgments.""--David"
"Page, ""Man,"" etc., Edinburgh, 1867."
Appendix V.
"Since I have recorded this incident of my lecture in Chicago, it is"
peculiarly fitting and pleasant to be able to give the following
extract from the review of the first edition of this book printed in the
_Chicago Times_. No great daily paper would have dared to print such a
comment a few years ago. To-day it is stated as a matter quite beyond
controversy:
"""She takes considerable pains to show _what one would think"
"need scarcely be insisted upon in our day_, that the morals of"
"civilization--morals in general, indeed--are not at all based in or"
"dependent upon religion, certainly not on Christianity, since the"
"so-called 'golden rule' the highest principle of morality, antedates"
"Christianity a thousand years."""
ADDRESS TO THE CLERGY AND OTHERS.
Up to the present time I have tried to reply personally to each one

Hannah G. got dumped because she liked too many of Jonty Crawford's pictures.
"Hannah's such a ""like"" whore."
"She'll, like, ""like"" anything."
"Even, like, a gross tuna sandwich you, like, made or whatever."
"That was super interesting, Jenna, but it added nothing to the conversation."
Just a tip.

"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'll be right down."
No coffee.
I gotta go.
Okay?
-What did you do to your hair?
-I cut it.
What do you think?
I thought we agreed that you'd talk to me before doing something to your hair.
What do you think of it?
-It's short.
"-Good, he eats his carrots."
-Makes you look younger.
-Benny's waiting for you.
All right.
"Well, here."
You fat honey dripper.
"Come up with the rest of our money, or I'll strip the lard off your ugly...."

"Yeah listen, I need to talk to you about something."
Alright then.
What is it?
It is a...
There's a case I'm working on.
It's a murder.
And we've found something at the scene.
What?
It's blood but it's not the victim's.
We ran some DNA tests and there's a match.
"Mark, it's Jesse."
"The DNA, it's Jesse."
He's alive.
- So you're saying he's a murderer?
"- No, nobody is saying anything."
"20 years, 20 years, what the hell!"
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
What the hell are you doing?

-She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog?
She invited me to her house for dinner tonight.
-l think she wants to have sex.
-With who?
-With me.
-With you.
Hang on a second.
Nope.
He'll fry in hell forwhat he did to me.
But Nixon don't knowthat.
Which is why I'm gonna have to remind him that he needs us... a hell ofa lot more than we need him.

I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.

I could help you.

He saved Ben.
-We're his parents.
How is he?
-It's too soon.
-The news said his heart stopped.
-It's going now.
-How's he doing?
-Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
-Blood pH 7.37.
-Thank God for small miracles.
-How's the patient?
-He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
-What's his temp?
-Eighty-five degrees.
-He's not warming up enough.
-Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
-That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
-You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.

He's like a little kid.
Little.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Wait a minute.
You can talk to him?
Kinda.
He can't say a lot of words yet but he understands things pretty good.
DEAN:
"Oh, yeah."
I see.

He's my friend.
"Yeah, what am I?"
Am I your friend?
"Bring some Franken-bot with out-of-state plates over here, make me change my tune."
I don't like that jazz.
"God, I'm tired."
"So, he can stay?"
Tonight.
"Tomorrow, I don't know."

"It's me, Jasper and my cousin Lou."
"Not exactly Arcade Fire, but we can play a little."
"- Hey, you doing all right?"
"- Oh, yeah."
I'm ok.
"It's not quite where I want it to be, but hopefully one more surgery and I should be back to top form."
That's great to hear.
We're on soon.
"Um, Lou just pulled up."
Punctual as always.
"A little help, here!"
"Besides, it would be confusing."
Jeff is way too young to be a grandfather.
"No, I'm not."
"Yes, you are."
Your hands don't shake;

You can't be a grandfather.
"Yes, I can."
"No, you can't."
But I am a grandfather.
"No, you're not."
"Yes, I am."
I have two grandchildren from Christine's sister.
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
Their names are Sasha and Caleb.
"No, they're not."
He's such a good grandfather.
Those kids love their Papa Jeff..

"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.

You're the one who looks beautiful.
It's your day.
Gosh.

There we go.
Wonderful.

- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.
Good.
All right.
Now all you gotta do is just think warm thoughts.
You gotta think Hawaii and you gotta think the Sahara Desert.
You gotta think about....
Come here!
Come on!
You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!
"You gotta stay awake for me, all right?"
Okay.
All right?
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.
Why don't we just sing a song.
"- You know songs, don't you?"
- No.
"All right, yeah."
Yeah.
"How about ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""?"
"All right, listen."
Come here.
I've gotta get some help.
- No!
Don't go.
Don't!
- It's okay.
"Please, don't."
"You gotta sing as loud as you can, so I can hear you."
All right?
I'm not the one who has the explaining to do.
Dale's son--explain that.
Explain cancer.
Explain war.
Explain the whole damn thing to me just one time... so I can understand why everything has to be so hard.
"( sobs ) Oh, God."
I'm sorry I hurt him.
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
Allie...
LISA:
Allie...
"What are you doing, Allie?"
Charlie...
Look at me.
Look at me.
"Look at me, Dad."
He's all right?
What do you think we ought to do now?
.
( cell phone rings )
"Yes, Ray?"
"Heiio, Ray?"
No.
This is Allie.
We're all going to come out of the building now.
Please tell everybody not to shoot.
I'll go with you.
All right.
They're coming down.
She says she'll come with us if we let the others go.
Everybody set?
- Mary...you can't do this.
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
Just hold it right there.
"Yeah, he's young."
"He's not tall, but he's young."
Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hey, let's hope it's a boy!"
Huh?
Philip!
"Come on, stand up."
"Oh, you are standing. (LAUGHS)"
"Come in, come in."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh!
In you come.
(WHISPERS) We will be social with these women tonight.
"Son, you're young."
Come on.
Huh?
What are you?
- Old.
- Yeah?
Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
"Dads, dads, dads!"
You call me that if you want to call anybody dads!
"You're my kid, see?"
Joey!
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
"You'll get that into your head right now, or-"
"Please, don't!"
"Don't, Joe!"
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here-
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
"Here's your medal, Kid."
"I can't now, I'm too busy."
I'll keep it for you.
"Well, we got a croaker."
Always come in handy in our family
"- Eh, kid?"
Huh?
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Wake up, kid."
"Come on, Come on, kid."
We got to walk in in style.
Oh-oh!
Honey child!
He's back!
"Oh, my darling's back!"
My boy!
I do!
I do!
All gone!
That's all... the next one!
Gé!
That's for Gerrit of course!
A real clodhopper's name.
Damn it!
"Christine, my girl..."
She's had...
She's been married twice!
She's been fucking married twice!
Why didn't you tell me?
What a god awful movie... I don't like nature films...
Gé... I've had Gé... I'll try Henk.
Hello Henky!
I'm the first talking goldfish.
Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...
"Tiddle-dee, tiddle-door, who is number four?"
"Christine, darling..."
What's this?
What are you doing here?
"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
- Malakai ?
Are you all right ?
"- Yeah, yeah, man."
Anybody catch one ?
"It ain't over, bitch."
"I don't even know why it started, bitch."
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek.
That's what this is about.
"No, it's about you."
White girls like you.
"Creepin' up, takin' our men."
"The whole world ain't enough, you got to conquer ours too."
"Whatever, Nikki."
"Derek and I like each other, and if you have a problem with that, screw you."
[Train Clacking]
[KnockAt Door] I'll get it.
- [Knocking]
"- Yeah, I'm coming."
"- Oh, hi."
- Shit !
- l'm okay.
- Wait.
Let me see.
I'm really okay.
I'm fline.
"Well, what did she do ?"
"Um, now is really not a good time to talk."
- Okay.
Well-- - l'll call you.
"Oh, no."
"Here, let me see."
~ What?
~ Happy birthday.
"Well, I was 40."
Who wants to be 40?
I wouldn't mind.
"Were you there, Mrs Magath?"
'Course.
We were all there.
"Us, Jo, Scottie, Michael."
Michael?
~ Michael Woodruff.
~ Who's he?
Michael and me were Scottie's best friends.
Since we were kids.
Where can we find him?
Organising the bin strike.
"Oh, that Michael Woodruff."
~ Good news for rats.
~ Hm!
"Do you think we could take Jo home, assuming she's identified the body?"
Although it might not be him.
"No, it is him."
You seem to be... ~ What?
"~ Are you suspicious, or something?"
No.
Though I wouldn't mind finding out who took a lump out of your face.
"Oh, this."
"Oh, it's er..."
hijinks at the party.
Michael started smashing chairs over our heads.
Why was that?
Pissed.
Oh.
"Oh, no."
Can this be evil?
Dr. Jekyll.
Dr. Jekyll?
"- What's happening, sir?"
Are you all right?
- What is it?
What do you want?
"Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Now, wait a minute."
"Wait a minute, Poole."
"Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?"
"Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir."
"Yes, Poole?"
"I'm sorry, sir, but I..."
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
"I thought something was happening, sir."
"No, no, no."
"It's quite all right, Poole."
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.
A Mr. Hyde.
I let him out the back door.
"Oh, I see, sir."
"Very good, sir."
"Miss Beatrix is here, sir."
"I showed her into the consulting room, sir."
"I hope I did right, sir."
"Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole."
Tell Miss Beatrix I'll be there immediately.
"Very good, sir."
"Listen, my wife and I are really lost."
"We're trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
"Why don't you buy the map, then I can help you."
Okay.
"Okay, now."
"Your problem is... (MAP RUSTLES) ...is you're way up here, you see that?"
- (DOOR CHIME RINGS)
"- Oh, my God, that is a problem..."
Yeah.
Now what you have to do is you have to take five all the way south toward Salem.
That's right down there.
You see that?
- CUSTOMER:
Hey!
- NEAL:
Okay.
OWNER:
That's where you go.
Got it?
CUSTOMER:
"Hey, mister, that guy's stealing..."
EMMA:
"Oh, God!"
"Oh, God."
- NEAL:
Honey?
"- (EMMA PANTING, GROANING)"
I think...
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"It's bedtime, Sheriff."
- You all right to drive?
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?
- Positive.
"- Take it easy, Freddy."
- Take it easy.
[ Radio ] It was not Lady Luck thatJim Maloney found in Atlantic City.
It was the cops.
The 30-year-old native of the Caribbean island of Antigua... was captured in a casino just days after an aspiring rap artist... was fatally beaten in a Queen's convenience store.
Sources have filled in some of the blanks for 1 0 1 0 WINS saying--
Shit!
"[ Music, Chattering ]"
Oh!
All right.
"Take it easy, take it easy."
I apologize.
"Magilla Gorilla, you fucking ape."
"- Mikey, I'm out."
I'm gettin' outta here.
- Where're you goin'?
- I love her.
- Yeah!
Hell of a party!
- Roger.
"- Okay, Superboy."
"You're my man, Superboy."
"- My man, Roger."
- Keep it up.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What have you got?
A contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
What?
I don't have a wipe.
Give...
Give me a wipe.
Just...
I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.
"Oh, thank you."
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
My gosh.
There are so many.
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.
Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?
Excuse me.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
I got a little distracted.
"Apart from you, we don't have anyone here."
I don't know. I have exams.
"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
"It's quiet tonight, huh, Freddy?"
Hmm?
It's quiet.
Everyone's at that bachelor party across the river.
"Oh, yeah."
Whoop-de-doo.
You got any quarters?
"Don't look at me, I just put two more in the meter."
- It's his birthday.
"- [ Figgis ] Oh,yeah?"
- He's going for high score.
"- Happy birthday, Freddy."
Happy Birthday.
Let me see what I got.
I wasn't into making a big deal after the ten-year thing.
"Hey, hey, how you doin'?"
"Sorry, Freddy."
Hey.
"[ Figgis ] I was wondering if you'd be able to, uh, come by."
Yeah. 4 Aces.
Where else?
Shit!
Damn it.
Two kinds of people in this world.
Pinball people and video game people.
"You, Freddy, you're pinball people."
"Always got somethin' to say, Figgsy."
Come on.
"Freddy, Freddy, Freddy."
Freddy!
Freddy!
Come on.
"Sime, what do they say about the weather?"
I believe we can expect bora wind.
But I already missed last time.
Lebicada will start blowing.
You can expect 3-5 on Bofor scale.
"Mist in the morning, it'll go away in the afternoon."
You should sail away as late as possible.
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day?
Are you out of your mind?
"I told you, now it's up to you."
"Put this piece there, too."
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day...
"- I'll be off, Stef."
Bye.
- See you.
Come and get it!
We've got nice salad!
"- Here I am, Ivka, Mirta."
"- Hi there, Sime!"
Bills for you...
- Do you have something for me?
- A letter.
- Wait!
Take this.
- There's no need.
- Thank you.
Bye!
- Bye.
"- Hey, Tesla!"
"- Hi there, Sime."
- I've got a letter for you.
- Thank you.
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
I don't know.
You set the bar pretty high.
Oh.
That's funny.
I'm Carol...
Rance.
I know.
I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.
I get that.
I want a partner.
"Hey, mertala."
Is she here?
Who is it?
!
It's Mr. Matt!
I've been to the Biesbosch.
I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you've been away.
Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."
- You want me to put out an APB?
- No.
I think I know where she is.
What's that?
Lunch.
Open it or he dies!
Open it.
"- [Nixon] Birchers, yeah."
"- This thing's pretty straight, Dick."
"- [TV] In Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald- oswald's got a Cuba connection?"
- [Nixon] To Castro?
...maximum security facility.
- He's a Communist.
That makes sense.
"- [Continues, Faint]"
"Okay, well, thank you, Edgar."
"SenatorTed Kennedy, arriving early this morning... with his mother and sister, Eunice."
"Hoover says this oswald checks outas a... a beatnik, a real bum."
"Dick, you should call Bobby."
"Ah, he doesn'twantme atthe funeral."
- You don't have to go.
- DeGaulle's gonna be there.
McMillan.
Adenauer.
[TVContinues] We go nowto the rotunda-
Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him.
I'm sure itwas an oversight.
"- [TV] Thousands, ofmourners..."
- [Mutters] Yeah.
- Will pay their respects...
- Jesus.
To theirfallen leader.
It's awful.
It's an awful thing forthis country.
[Pat] Dick.
Huh?
"No, it's his way, uh..."
He hates me.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?
"You mustn't get upset, Franz."
Don't start yelling right away.
What is it?
What is it?
It's not my fault!
"""Murder in Freienwalde."""
It's not my fault!
It's...
"It's Mieze, isn't it?"
Our little Mieze.
It's all over now.
Now they've done it.
Who was it?
Who was it?
I don't know.
"All I read was ""blond hair,"""
and blond hair has to mean Reinhold.
I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.
Drop the bat.
-Lance.
Sit the fuck down.
"-What the hell are you doing, lance?"
Put that gun down.
"-Are you okay, man."
Oh shit Hyder.
"-Is he okay, roger?"
"Well, I hope he's okay, bitch."
-Just put the gun down please.
This bitch hit Hyder.
-No I didn't know it was him.
Where the hell 'd'you get a gun?
Stop talking.
-Lance.
What are you doing?
"-She's gonna call the cops, man, we're all going to Juvie."
I'm not calling anybody.
-Sit the fuck down.
Jacob.
"-Lance, chill out."
"Shut the hell up, sit back."
Lance I got it chill out.
Okay.
What are you doing.
-I'm sorry.
"[Muffled] What are you doing, Jacob stop."
"Stop that, stop fighting him."
"Quit moving, quit moving."
"Quit moving, lay the fuck down."
"It's okay, it's okay."
What are you doing?
Er...
Maybe I should let you talk.
You tell me what you feel
- and... and... and how I let you down.
"- Please, not now."
"Right, right."
It's not my call.
Er...
"Erm... the thing is, Frances..."
I hate meself for what I've done.
Much more than you ever could.
You know?
I know that doesn't change anything or make it better...
"God, I'm terrible at this!"
All I want to say is...
"I've been... a terrible father... but... that doesn't mean I, er... don't care or... feel..."
What the fuck?
Jesus!
You...
Get out!
Get out!
- Get out of my room!
- Stop it!
- Don't start!
- Get out!
He was in the bed!
"I don't care, don't even..."
- What do you mean?
- Paul!
Bastard.
"Oh... oh, fuck!"
"Come back, you little bastard!"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Over here.
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.

[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
-Your way!
-Make your way
"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.
-Erik.
-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!

She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.

Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.

-Oh!
Buzz!
"Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something."
"What is it, boy?"
-He's saying that this was no accident.
-What do you mean?
-I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
-No!
...by Woody!
-What?
-Wait a minute.
"You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you?"
Potato Head?
"That's Mr Potato Head to you, you back-stabbing murderer!"
"Now, it was an accident, guys."
Come on.
"Now, you, you gotta believe me."
"We believe ya, Woody."
"Right, Rex?"
"Well, ye..."
N...
I don't like confrontations!
"Where is your honour, dirt bag?"
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to...
Hey!
"You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody?"
[LAUGHS]
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
"Oh, please, give me another chance."
I just couldn't stand it.
Couldn't...
I can't do any more time.
"Please, turn me out of here."
We'll do what we can for you.
Go along now.
Next man.
[¶¶¶]
I don't know.
I don't know anything about it.
Honest.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
That's the truth.
"You gotta believe me, fellas."
I'm waiting.
I don't know.
"Don't, Stacey, don't."
"All right, I'll tell!"
Spill it!
"It was Carlisle, Polecat Carlisle."
Hanley had him do it.
I didn't have no part in it.
I just fingered him.
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.
Polecat.
Yeah.
Because...
I'm having an asthma attack... from the stress !
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, my God."
Do you have an inhaler ?
Or like an Epi pen ?
I could stab you.

"Young man, what is going on ?"
"Oh, my."
The girl you like ?
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me."

Swear you'll get it right back.

"Here, you take the twenty, I don't want to touch his money."
His money.
"Your money, I don't do anything."
Just-
- Just fold it.
"No, no, no."
"Fold it, fold it, fold it."
"And then again, this way."
Crease it.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like this.
"Yeah, yeah, good, good, good."
"Here, so if I rub the twenty, just like this, here."
"Can you see, your twenty?"
- Yeah.
- Look.
"If I rub the twenty against the one, see, the ink'll start to change."
See?
"Here, you see your twenty?"
"I'm going to give you my one, but look."
If I just place the little piece on top like this and I do that.
"See, now, actually--"
No...
I kinda messed up.
George:
Oh!
That's a--
Get rid of it.

"Oh, come on in."
What are you doing?
A little spying.
"Spying, on who?"
On Gretchen.
"You see, Bob can't figure out why he hasn't been called back to active duty."
Mr. Miles?
Yeah.
Bob?
Yeah.
He's in the Army?
"Well, sure."
He's in the reserves.
"Gee, now, if they called him back to active duty, then Nancy and me..."
What?
"Oh, I was just wondering to myself."
How come he wasn't called back?
"Well, read this."
It's from Gretchen to Colonel Blair's wife.
You shouldn't read other people's mail.
That's not very nice.
The Costa del Sol.
She found a job there.
She loved me.
Nobody commits suicide with a suitcase.
- What suitcase?
- Hers.
They found it floating in the river.
Castro.
Who was it?
I don't know.
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.
Late means late.
"What do I do if there's no phone, paint one?"
"I'm working, don't start."
I am calm.
You're the one who isn't!
Good morning.
I'm sorry.
- Morning.

I asked him for a list of all the Dyane 6's in the area.
When did you talk to him?
- Early.
- You never sleep?
- Sure I do.
He gets what he wants.
And I guess he wanted me.
You know what?
I've really missed you over the years.
Me too.
You know you're the only person I was ever able to talk to.
After Jesse...
Why didn't you contact me when you came back ?
"You know, no bullshit, Pru."
Just the real reason.
I don't know...
I just thought...
The past was better left there.
It's Slade.
Just checking to see if you're OK.
Where are you ?
I'm just out.

A friend ?
"Yes, Slade, a friend."
I do have them.
Put her on.
Sorry ?
Pru.
Put her on.
"Hi, Pru."
How is he doing ?
He didn't seem too good the other night.
"Yeah he's fine, considering."
- Did he speak much about Jesse ?
- Not really.
You keep it away!
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
No one.
Who are you?
"She's, she's all right."
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
"Okay, I'll talk to you."
"I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?"
"No, I just, I'm going through something and I just have to...."
"No, no...."
There's nothing.
"Hey, thanks a lot."
-Want a drink?

He won't talk to her.
He says he hates her.

"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.

"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.

I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"

"Have a seat, my lady."
We are ready.
I got the last one.
She made me teach her this.
I hate it when you dominate the remote.
I'm curious if gay porn has gotten to Oceanside yet.
"You know, I stay in a lot of hotels."
This is research for me.
"Here we go, ""Thirty-Something Inches,"" only $10.95."
Shall we?
"Come on, give me that."
- Wait!
Is that Jonathan?
It is Jonathan!
- Give it to me.
He won't let me in.
I just want to apologize.
Why don't you stay here and I'll try and talk to him?
Thanks.
Did you try him at home?
"Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna..."
"Hey, he's not there and his cell's still turned off."
You told him you were coming here.
"He knows, right?"
I told him.
"Or, I mean..."
What?
Did you?
"Oh, man."
I'm not gonna do this.

- What's wrong?
- Can't do what?

"Chris, can't do what?"
"- Jenna, please."
"- Can't do what, Chris?"
- You should just talk to Michael.
"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?

He should be telling you.

Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?

Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."

"We're friends, forget it."
Where are you sneaking off?

But you're... you know.
What?
"Well, you're not exactly..."
"Not exactly what, exactly?"
"Not exactly, you know."
"A player, a don, an R Kelly, a baby daddy..."
All right.
I get it.
"A smooth criminal, a president of the USA, a buddha buddha buddha cheese buddha."
"Hey, Sid."
- Er...
You having a good evening?
"- I'm just marvellous, Sidney."
Like hell on Earth in here.
Glorious.
Yourself?
"Er, yeah, yeah, I'm all right."
Excellent!
"In a half-hour, it's done."
Here he is.
Stay in the car!
Get going!
Stop it!
Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.
Choose.
"OK, let's have it."
I know two of 'em:
Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.
You got friends now?
Slab.
What?
-There What you want to say.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
Why not say again?
Slab.
I did not say you were bad.
I did not say that you are weak.
-Do you love me?
It's not about that.
"No, not about that!"
"No, it's not about that!"
-It's About it!
-Not!
-You did not answer me!
"Yes, I love you."
-When You love someone...
Amends.
Do not turn your back.
You have to be careful with that.
It may never get.
"I can not do this to work with you, Edward."
I can not keep doing this.
Susan.
You can not turn your back on problems all the time.
Come on.
Come on.
-Shit.
I told you I do not know.
"- ""Oh, please."""
My very serious and very busy friend doesn't want to be disturbed.
Maybe she can join us?
She's working.
"Oh Albert, come on!"
(disco music)
Do you want to take them off?
You've got the best buttocks.
Lick me.
I want you to suck me and lick me.
Do I look sexy?
Do I look sexy now?
I'm gonna to be two minutes.
You're gonna fuck me?
- Do you promise?
- Absolutely.
- You won't be asleep?
- No.
Just a sec.
Are there any condoms?
(Camilla laughs)
(disco music picks up)
"Albert, help me."
Help me!
"Albert, I want the Tower of Pisa."
"Albert, I want it big."
I want it big.
Too much noise.
"Albert, for the first time   you're..."
I wanna be fucked.
(Camilla giggles)
It's a log.
Come on.
"Should I help him along, Dad?"
"You know your dad, God bless his Irish soul..."
He was...
How shall I put it?
He was sort of killed.
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.
Tell Tommy.
"Come on, tell him!"
Don't move or I'll fucking kill you!
Son of a bitch.
Jimmy!
Get up!
Get up!
- I'll kill you.
- I'm your son.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
"- Vince, no!"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
"But it's over now, because we're going in... together."
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
"No, no, no!"
Hit him in the belly!
"You got him, Nelson!"
Knock him out!
- How do you like it now?
- I still say it'll go the limit!
"- Little Boy, I need some more dough!"
"- All you want, baby!"
We'll make it 100!
A hundred?
"Look, I don't want to take your money, sister!"
- Put your dough where your mouth is!
"- Okay, okay!"
It's a bet!
Finish him!
"Come on, finish him, Nelson!"
Nelson's opened up his left eye!
- It's bleeding!
- Good!
"Come on, Nelson!"
"Get him, Nelson!"
Come on!
Stand up and fight!
Nelson's pounding his kidneys!
The sucker!
Why don't he work on that eye?
That's more like it!
Come on!
I don't like this!
I don't like it!
"- Hey, what goes on here?"
- Don't you like it?
You're trying to cross me!
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
-
I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
What?
"He says let alone fish, not even a fly will enter the house!"
Right?
Take him inside.
Mr Sharma...
Shivraj Sharma!
Let's go in!
Aunty...!
Coming.
Where are you?
In here.
Give me the towel.
What are you staring at?
What's wrong?
"It's been days, you know..."
Don't stay in the water for long.
You'll catch a cold.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's me.
"Please fasten this, please."
"What's your size, aunt?"
- 48 C.
That sounds like a bus number!
So much of junk!
I can't find a thing in this drawer!
What are you looking for?
A safety pin!
Remind me to clear out the mess tomorrow.
- 5 kilos of gourd... that's what we call it here in Mumbai.
What's going on over here?
Today's the Karva Chauth.
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to a dictator...
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
-What is this here?
-Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
She likes it when she gets a warm meal.
Oh Franz.
I'm not hungry.
"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."
- Bon appetit!
Thanks.
Do we want to leave?
Why don't we just stay?
Just for now.
310?
Women's bathroom.
1 15?
"Two keys, no lock."
412?
Two keys.
Very disappointed!
Morning!
Lovely start to the week.
After you.
Hey!
I know!
Yep.
Belting.
And you were right what you said about pasties and leper colonies.
Was I?
Bought her a plant?
Lovely - she's in a meeting.
"No, it's for him."
It's him I've come to see.
The boss.
"Oh, blimey."
There'll be no trouble.
"We just need to set things straight, the three of us."
To move forward.
You can't lay new lino over a dead cat.
"Now, tell him he's got a visitor."
Use the intercom if you don't want to go in there.
Hello?
"Sorry, Mr Stanley, someone to see Mr Stanley."
Over.
"'I'm in a meeting, Pauline!"
'
Say it won't take long.
"It won't take long, he says!"
Over.
'For crying out loud.
Hang on...'
I'll kill you!
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
You get some sleep.
Okay.
Very good.
All right.
"Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb."
Louie's waiting.
It's nice and warm.
"Yes, honey."
What?
Fuck it.
-I've never seen him acting up.
-Really.
Blind is what he was.
Down on Thoity-Thoid and Thoid
"-Hi, Chris."
This is a great party.
"-Yeah, don't stop."
Keep going.
I don't need any encouragement.
"My idea of heaven is a solid white nightclub with me as a headliner for all eternity, and they love me."
Down on the east side
Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid
That's my home sweet home
Some people think It's the home of black eyes
Just because--
"Hey, I think we've got a guest."
You're gonna die up there.
Regan?
I knew we'd be the last ones here.

MAN 4:
"Well, that makes no sense."
-Ready to see the inner sanctum?
-Born that way.
I'm glad we're all here.
Have all four sidekicks ever been in the same place at the same time?
Don't call us sidekicks.
Not after today.
Sorry.
First time at the Hall.
I'm a little overwhelmed.
You're overwhelmed.
Freeze was underwhelmed.
Why isn't anyone ever just whelmed?
Oh.
Maybe that's why.
"Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, Kid Flash."
Welcome.

Make yourselves at home.

Maybe you're taking this accident thing a bit too hard.
I mean...
"If they wanted you out, they could just fire you."
I'm not worried about being fired.
Then what are you worried about?
I don't know yet.
"There you go, made to order."
- Thanks.
- Surprise!
Got ya!
That one's going on the fridge.
"Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas."
By the carousel.
Just a minute.
"Okay, ready."
Smile!
It helps if you push the button.
Trevor?
What is it?
"- This place, brings back memories."
- Good memories I hope.
"Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid."
"My ex, probably phone to ruin a happy Mother's Day."
Could you...?
"Yes, no sweat."
I'll take Nicolas for a ride.
Thanks.

"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know.
I text.
So I get it.
"Sorry, what did you say, mom?"
"You know, lol."
Omg.
Om-- you know what--g.
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"
"Founé, hand me the phone."
Good morning.
"Yes, it's me."
Is the boss in?
Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
"He'll probably be furious, but we're used to that."
Who's we?
"Oh, me and Pauline."
It's my boss.
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.
Oh.
I thought he was married.
"Well, yes."
That's been the complication.
The boss I met?
Mr Stanley?
Yes.
But he is married.
I heard him saying something about his wife.
They don't get on.
They're all very showjump-y.
Who are?
The wife and the daughters.
He's got daughters?
Yes.
Two.
They do dressage.
But you haven't had an affair with him?
"Well, yes."
What did you think you were doing?
To them?
What I was doing?
To their family.
You had no right.
He was somebody's husband and he was somebody's father.
"That's wrong, Enid."
Vamos!
"- No, it could be a trap."
- Is this the only way into the village?
- Yes.
I'll send scouts ahead.
Let my men do it.
That's what they're trained for.
"- Do as he says, Major."
- Cooper!
Scouts ahead.
Lively!
"Major, I'll leave you to secure your precious box and Rifleman Harper."
"Teresa, you bring your men with me."
"- Miguel, Paco, aqui."
"- Los demás, conmigo."
Retira el cofre.
"Venga, movete."
"Carlo, José!"
Mierda.
Yargh!
Harris!
"You say you are an Irishman, a prisoner."
Why should you be loyal to the British dogs who want to take you to Lisbon to shoot you?
"Jesus, you took the words out of my mouth."
I can help you.
Give me the box.
Right.
Fine.
But what do I get?
You will be rich.
And if I don't?
You will be dead.
I'll be in front of the store at 7. I'll wait for you!
I wasn't going to go back to the department store.
Yes!
Oi!
What are you doing!
?
She's dead!
That's him.
That must be him.
It's revenge because she told everyone about him peeping into her room.
Who?
Who the hell is he!
?
He's not here.
He must've run away.
Where the hell is he!
?
Please don't be silly.
What do you think you're doing with that gun?
Get your hands off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
There he is.
That's him.
That's the guy!
Tomorrow night at seven.
Just one more time.
I'm used to being disappointed.
Tomorrow night at seven...
I want to see her.
I want to meet her.
I heard that you'd finished.
'Course it does.
You bugger.
Mam!
Wait!
What did he say?
Who?
Him.
Nothing.
He said he'd given me a ball or something.
A ball?
He didn't say to come with him or anything?
To Canada?
No.
No.
"Because you're staying with me, aren't you?"
"Mam, can we play the record?"
No.
I told you.
But why?
Because I don't want to hear it!
Now fasten it up.
"You don't get it out, you don't show it anybody, and you don't tell anybody."
I mean it.
"She said, ""Pop in."""
She wants me to pop in.
"I'm not making this up, am I?"
"She wants me, Tubby Baker, to come and see her in her office."
"Got to mean something, hasn't it?"
Ooh.
"One, two."
And...
"# In this grove, in this grove"
Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?
- No way the Rams cover.
You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
Fitz.
You get started on the windows.
Okay.
And you get to work on the potty.
Thank you.
"And you know neither one of us is ever going to get to bang her, right?"
You have no patience.

I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ALL AUTOBOTS
SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE GALAXIES.
"THOUGH CYBERTRON HAS FALLEN, WE STILL STAND."
"FOLLOW THESE COORDINATES TO JOIN US, PRIORITY PRIME."

"WHEREVER THERE IS AN EMERGENCY, THERE ARE RESCUE BOTS, SIR."
WAIT.
WHY WOULDN'T WE BE ACTIVE?
HOW LONG WERE WE IN STASIS?
WE BETTER CHECK IN WITH CYBERTRON H.Q.
"THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY,"
OR POSSIBLE.
CYBERTRON IS NO LONGER OUR HOME.
THIS PLANET IS.
[ SEAGULL CALLING ]
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.
(TRIS SOBBING)
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Candor sim complete.
(GUNFIRE)
Four.
You're here.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I am."
You're here.
- Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Secure the hallway.
All right.
"Uh, yeah."
Sure.
Hi.
I know.
Brian's here.
Relax.
"All I said was ""Hi""."
Are you gonna bite my head off if I ask you how you are?
"I had a great time in Bali on my non-honeymoon,"
- and tomorrow I start working.
- That's good.
But Brian is here.
"Yeah, well, wasn't that how you guys planned it?"
"Adam, who are you blaming here?"
Marjorie or Brian?
I'm not blaming anybody.
"I'm just... trying to move on with my life, Nicole."
That's all.
"Yo, Adam."
Get your scrawny ass in here.
I need somebody I can beat.
"I'm sorry, Nicole."
I gotta go help a friend.
- Whoa.
Sorry
- Excuse me.
"Hey, honey."
Guys and video games--
- What's the chick equivalent?
- I don't know.
Pedicures?
Let me smell you.
Come here.
I wish you wanted to go out.
I am out.
I don't live here.
"Oh, I adopted a cat."
I know.
You send me pictures.
I send them or I sent them once?
"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."
There you go.
Smile.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Think of something funny.
Nice.
There you go.
It's me.
Work it.
Work it.
"Classic, but not a comedy."
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...
- the summer...
"- Laura, come quickly."
What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."
You've got no choice.
Come here.
Hold this.
Swab.
Suck it up.
I can't see anything.
- We need more blood.
Ligature.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.
Tell me what you know.
"When Amador does business on the West Coast, he washes his deal through Alvers."

I´m Jason Carasone from Division.
These men´ll escort the prisoner to CTU.

"We're,like,at..."
Wilson's.
Hey.
I totally wasn't waiting for you.
My sister's car got towed.
Right.
Johnny!
"What's up,brother?"
"- Good show tonight,man."
"- Thanks,brother."
"- See you tomorrow,Johnny."
- Johnny.
"Yeah,the show was great."
"Your musical tastes have changed a bit,huh?"
"Oh,yeah,I guess you can't really sing along to the new stuff,huh?"
"I don't sing,remember?"
- Yeah.
I do.
- I noticed you're rocking the eyeliner now.
What's up with that?
"What,you don't like it?"
I dig it.
"It's just,I..."
"I admire that you can do the ""in the eye"" thing."
It makes me look like Boy George.
"Yeah,well,uh  you never needed any help drawing attention to your eyes."
"So,how's..."
"It was good to see you,Bella."
- Oh.
Okay.
- Take care.
Bye.
The one from Sophia?
"- No, why?"
"Okay, never mind."
Thank you.
- Sure.
Sanchez.
"- Detective, it's Danny Ferman."
Hi.
"- Danny boy, how are you?"
I'm good.
Thank you.
"Did you guys call my office to pull,"
Sophia's voicemail off my machine?
Maybe.
We do that.
I'll look into it.
"Oh, and by the way, tox came back on her."
OD'd like I said.
- Okay.
We got a statement from the neighbor.
Russian woman.
A real character.
"- Yeah, I saw her last night."
"She said she saw a man stop by at the vic's early in the day, but no sign of a struggle."
"My gut says they were either shooting up together, or he was a dealer."
- She give a description?
Vague.
She said it was a white guy.
Big.
Really big.
That's it?
- That's it.
The first person to get the answer to the next problem
Doesn't have to go talk to Ms. Rinsky.
"Deal. ""Two trains are leaving the station at the same time..."""
Fine!
I'll go.
What was I worried about?
It had been months
Since I last saw ms.
Rinsky.
She might not even remember me.
Hi.
Ms. Rinsky.
Frankie Heck.
Brick's mom?
Ohh.
Not today.
She remembers me.
Would you like me to come back another time?
No.
Sit.
Talk.
Unburden yourself during my limited free time.
Okay.
"Well, see, Brick got a ""d"" on his math test."
"Sometimes kids get D's, but not your son."
"Oh, no."
He has to be perfect
"At every single thing he does, right, mommy?"
I...
"You know, ms."
"Rinsky, you're very funny."
Brick never mentioned how funny you are.
"Left, right, face."
Forward.
Your brother was a good man.
"Yes, he was."
She won't get out of the car.
Oh...
Hey.
"Welcome home, Maggie."
"You know, I think it'll make you feel better to be with everyone."
We all miss him.
That led was not your fault.
And it's also not your fault that you survived and he didn't.
Get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
- No.
No.
No.
"When we got back from Nam, we had a hard time too, but we got over it."
Out.
"- Take her home, Percy."
"- Come on, baby."
"It's okay, baby."
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Why don't you, uh...?"
Why don't you lose that shirt?
Come on.
- Unh.
- Drop that belt.
Take your clothes off.
-He's....?
"-Yeah, he's fine."
Yeah....
-Absolutely.
-Good.
ALICE:
"I was trying to remember, actually, the last time I saw Stephen and Phillipa."
I think it must have been Aunt Ena's funeral.
-I presume he's still working on the Advertiser?
-I don't know.
-Deputy news editor there or something.
"-Something like that, yeah."
"Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
And she still...
-does whatever she does in the City somewhere?
"-Yeah, I think so."
"-Yeah, that's right."
-Right.
And I suppose....
How old would Julie be now?
"Fourteen, I suppose, she must be."
"Fourteen, yeah, God."
"It makes you think, doesn't it?"
-Yeah.
-Certainly does.
"Oh, yes, how could I forget?"
I managed to get you some samples off the Givenchy counter.
-You didn't!
You little angel.
-Ysatis.
"Which I know you always wear, come rain or shine."
Sofie isn't here.
"Try her at home, right?"
'Bye.
Fuck.
I want these.
This is another kind of wine.

I miss you.
Here's to Simon.
Cheers.

- None of us did.
- He didn't tell us.
- I'm just glad you all came.
This rocks.
Where did you get it?
Yugo Danny.
It's hard-hitter blow from Columbia.
Doesn't matter.
I still know she doesn't hate you.
How?
I'm a daughter too.
Vi?
She left.
Where did she go?
To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"
I need for you to be the one to put me down.
It's very important.
Why me?
"Cause you and me are friends, right?"
"- I guess, but..."
- Will you promise me that?
- I can't.
- I need you to promise me.
- But I can't.
- I need you to do this for me.
- I can't.
- I need you to do this for me!
"- No, I can't!"
"- Don't argue with me, April!"
- But I'm Daisy.
- Just don't argue with me girl!
You promise me.
Say it.
- I promise.
- You promise?
"I said I would, didn't I?"
I have something to show you.
- Even if she doesn't remember.
- Yeah.
"- Yeah, so -"
- [Knocks]
- Hello?
- Ida?
- [Ida] Yes.
- Can we come in?
"- Well, of course."
Come in.
"Oh, Ida."
Okay.
"Can I just, uh, introduce you to someone... 'cause I'm not sure you're going to remember her."
- I'm Vivienne.
How are you?
Okay?
- [Ida] I'm fline.
You're not feeling too great.
"Well, I came to tell you that in the Poslun's auditorium... there is a picture of Alderman Herb Orliffe and his family... from about 1960, it says."
- [Ida] My goodness.
- Yes.
So when you're feeling well -
- I can get dressed...
- then we'll go for a ride.
- They probably want to film that.
"- Well, thank you very much."
"You think you can make me happy, Murray?"
- I
- I hope so.
- Oh.
- I'm not a pusher.
- [Laughs] Okay.
I think Joe there is the answer to that question.
"Let this thing lie down, John."
Understand?
"Thank you, John."
"Bob, look at this:"
"""Man thrown in prison for eloping with his sister-in-law. """

I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
"Nolt boy got killed, Tom."
- Who's that?
"- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt."
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
"That's what I shoot, a.45-.60."
"Shoot what, Tom?"
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
"He's dead, too."
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
You two could be perfect strangers.
"I think the one thing that we can agree on, today, is that you guys should be doing a lot better than just ""works."""
Pretty sure that's why you're here.
Oh.
That's it.
Great.
"Great job, everybody."
Thank you.
Lucy?
"Good day, sir."
I got room service for you.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't order that.
"I think your wife, she called me for you."
I'm...
This is just...
"Because I got a sunburn, 'cause it was..."
The sun was very strong today.
Yeah.
I know.
"This is good for sunburns, right?"
No.
Okay.
"It's good, yeah?"
It's good for sunburn?
"Okay, so I don't see anything."
See what?
There's nothing to see.
"Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
It works great.
"Okay, I move now."
No.
You're the first woman I've met at this school with a job.
- There was another one in the fourth grade.

But they got to her.
They reprogrammed her at Nordstrom's.
[LAUGHING]

- Oh!
I love you too.
Where are we going with this?

Sent me to fetch sticky tape.
Why don't you come have a cup of coffee with me instead?
- Really?
"- Yeah, blow them off."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why am I running errands for them?
They treat me like crap.
They even stuck me with the suckiest country.
Portugal.
"Yeah, I'm Portuguese."
"Well, here's the thing."
"I hate the country, love the people."
Move and I'll kill him!
"Run, Vito!"

Where did you see him last?
I-I don't know.
"Work, I think."
- Is that Roger?
- [door closes]
Did... did an Inazagi kill him?
Why are you showing me this?
"Hey, did you hear me?"
What happened?
Roger Caplan was murdered.
"Oh, God."
Who would want to hurt him?
[stammers] I don't know.
Who would want to hurt Roger Caplan?
I don't know.
- Did you ever hurt him?
- No.
Never.
How did he wind up dead in his car?
I told you.
I don't know.
I can't look at these.
"Please, I wanna get out."
Explain why your DNA and fingerprints
- are all over his car.
- I've been in his car lots of times.
His heart rate's high.
What about his brain activity?
- It's normal.
- Eye movement?
I'm sorry!
I'm trying to be totally honest with you!
"Jenna, I could've lied and I'd be inside that door right now, but I didn't."
"Isn't the truth more important than anything else, Jenna?"
Not if the truth is you slept with another woman!
Jen?
Just listen to me for one second.
I'm so sorry.
"Baby, I'm so sorry."
"Jenna, please..."
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me for one second.
I mean it!

Jenna?
Stop!
I love you!

Jenna?
Don't even think about coming in the house.
"Michael, I mean it."
- Okay.
I'm not gonna come inside.
"- Damn right, you're not."
"But I'm not gonna leave, either."
"Phew, it smells."
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
You OK now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"And some money, too, I hope."
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.

Dalton...
I didn't know you were a friend of the family.
"Hey, I didn't put him there."
I'm tryin' to find the guy who did.
"Mm, sorry, I don't know why I said that."
That's okay.
"I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh?"
I don't think so.
Dalton.
"Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic."
"Well, that's okay."
I guess we've both had a long day.
"Hey, you hungry?"
Yeah.
What kind of food do you like?
Anything.
"Like, you want a picnic?"
Ha... are you serious?
"Sure, why not?"
"Why not, indeed."

He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."
Hey.
I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"
- Shh!
"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."
- See you later.
"- Okay, have good day."
- Good.
You're still here.

Of course.
You got what you wanted.
I like to kiss the pretty ones.
There's another pretty one.
You got BankExchange.
-How did you know?
-l saw the kiss.
I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.
But he'll take a bath on those leases.
It'll just take him longer.
"-Something for him, something for me."

Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
It's started.
You better brace yourself.
What I said the other day-we'll do it tomorrow.
Where is Hyo-jin?
He's in the army now.
I think I've seen everything I want to see.
Thank you very much.
Sergeant.
Billy Parkin?
"That's right, sir."
"Hello, sir."
What's this all about?
Murder.
I'll never forget coming back from the pub.
And there she was.
Dead.
- That was the worst shock of my life.
- I'm sure.
Bloody Henry Faber.
"My hero, he was."
Bastard.
Even wounded in the war.
Medals on his chest.
"Anyway, what do you want me for?"
These are photographs of German military graduation classes.
"Same year, different schools."
Take your time.
"- I am looking for Faber, aren't I?"
- Yes.
That's him.
That's him.
That's Faber to the life.
And look.
"Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of German intelligence."
"And right behind him, his young student - the Needle."
- Going fishing?
These good people want to see me fuck you now.
No!
"We're gonna go away, We're gonna go away."
We're going to Berlin.
Right after you fuck me.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Berlin.
"Help me hold her down, she likes it."
It's Ok.
"It's Ok baby,"
No!
You'll die Adrian!
Kill me baby!
Kill me baby!
No!
What have we done?
Wait a minute.
We think clearly this cannot be explained.
It's easy to explain.
You wanna know who and what I am?
I'm a killer.
I kill with my cunt.
You can write about it... in Midnight Magazine.
Or National Enquirer.
It's gonna be a new sensation.
You wanted to know where I'm from?
I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.
"Oh, it's Hyotei!"
Hyotei is here!
- Yo Tezuka.
- Atobe.
Where did this kind of manners come from?
"How are you doing, players of Seigaku?"
Hoi?
You even send Junior students when your own players aren't good enough.
Hmm.
Who are you?
Really cute.
Tezuka.
We'll see you eat dirt today.
All the best.
You are?
Higaki Shioin.
The next player on the court is Seigaku's Tezuka against Gokuin's Nakano.
"Finally, he's playing."
"Oi, Echizen."
Why aren't you watching the match?
"You're Seigaku's regular, right."
Watch the match?
Why?
What why?
Kaidou.
I'm just saying.
"Anyway, I don't like these kind of things."
Tennis is just a game for solo players.
There's also doubles.
Is it that fun?
Doubles.
"It looks like you still don't know much, o-chibi."
This sucker's got a lot of symptoms.
"No shissh, Sherlock."
Good luck faking the goiter.
Goiter?
"Oh, my God."
That's why they wanted to see my neck.
"Oh, good lord."
Ooh.
- It worked.
- Yay.
"She says she loves you and she's sorry and-- oh, she's sending you a picture."
Yes.
Perky.
Just erase it.
He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
"Sure, um--"
"Down the hall, take your first right and it's the third door on the left."
"Thanks, Sam."
[GRUNTS]
"You got tall, Winchester."
[GROANS]

[SPIRIT THUDS]

[OBJECTS CLANKING]
"Trust me, this will help."
[SIGHS]
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
You know what I mean.
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
-What the hell?
"-Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just gotta go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
-What?
-Check it out.
"Martha Dumptruck, Revenge of the Nerds, Hello Kitty."
-They all rode the same bus.
"-Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"That would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
Of course.
Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Goodbye, and thank you."
627...
Wait.
... 9 6... ... 6 1... .
... o 9.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
Hello?
"Marco, is that you?"
"Yes, Benigno."
It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
Where are you?
Outside the clinic.
Dr. Vega told me everything.
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.
"So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like."
"My dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court."
Someone find her some clothes!
"Use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl."
I need a pig here!
(GRUNTING)
(RED QUEEN SIGHING)
I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet.
"-Would you like one, Um?"
"-No, thank you."
Sit!
(CHITTERING)
Sit!
Go away.
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.
Fat boys!
Oh.
There they are.
Aren't they adorable?
They have the oddest way of speaking.
"Speak, boys."
Amuse us.
Go on.
(MOUTHING) No.
Speak!
-Is that being...
"-No, no, it isn't."
"Oh, baby."
I didn't mean to piss you off this afternoon.
I really didn't.
"Can you hear me, baby?"
Honey?
"Peter, can you hear me?"
Honey?
Can you hear me?
"I'm here, baby."
- The artist has seen the other one.
- He's seen Paul?
"Hello, Lenny."
"Lenny, how are you?"
"Lenny, it's Sally."
"Come back, Lenny."
It's Sally.
Come back.
Move your jack.
Cover that bitch.
Yes.
Good.
Lovely.
"I've returned, and it's a good thing, too, Lenny."
The vibrations have changed.
They're not good here.
I heard this little child crying in the elevator.
"Could be a little girl from the Children's Ward, but..."
I think that Kingdom Hospital is haunted.
Haunted?
"And we're going to resume our séances tomorrow, first thing."
There's no time to lose.
You have to tell the others.
- Am I?
- You know you are.
"- Yeah, I suppose I am."
What about you?
I'm from Morpeth.
(KEY IN LOCK)
Here's Moz.
Fancy going into town?
- I'm going into town.
D'you want some fags?
- I've got some now.
I've been ringing round everywhere.
Not a blade of grass in town.
"- Good job your mate with the gear's here, then."
- Eh?
See ya.
When?
"Oh, it's you."
"- Ahoy, Captain!"
- What's that supposed to mean?
Nowt.
Goodbye.
(FARTS)
(FARTS)
What are you doin' here?
You threw a tin of dressed crab through my window.
I didn't mean owt by it.
Just trying to get your attention.
You've got it now.
"You're off, pal, you're not needed."
I've bought some wicked gear.
You can have a little bit of it if you want.
- Sports cars.
Mm.
- Yeah.
Now that you got me here what are you gonna do with me?
I'm going to...
Going to do this.
- Mom
- Damon?
"Oh, my God."
Matt.
"Oh, my God."
- I gotta...
"- It's fine, just go."
I'll take her home.
"Thanks, man."
- Where have you been?
"- Um, I needed some air."
For three hours?
"Tell me, where have you been?"
Out.
I was out.
"Annabelle, don't do this."
I can't fight you too.
What?
I'm sorry.
- Sorry I'm bailing.
- Just wish you'd let me drive you home.
Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards or babysitters.
"- We're normal tonight, remember?"
"- I know, I get so worried about you."
"Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone's gonna come after me."
I won't.
"Excuse me, sir."
- Jacob Pedersen?
- That's me.
"Christian Refner, I'm here to pick you up."
Do you have a coat?
No?
Then let's go.
- The room's okay?
- It's fine.
It used to be a department store.
Funny isn't it?
"- So, Jacob with a C or a K?"
- It's with a C.
I'm Christian with a C too.
- So you're meeting Jørgen?
- Yes.
- Do you know him well?
- He's my father-in-law.
- Or will be on Saturday.
- Congratulations.
Jørgen's fantastic.
"He's brilliant, really brilliant."
"- People often fear him, but don't."
- Good.
He's worth over a billion and started out flat broke.
- But you can't tell.
- That he started flat broke?
"No, no..."
- Jacob Pedersen is here.
- Have a seat.
Just for a moment.
"- It was nice to meet you, Jacob."
I'm his uncle!
Jong-gu!
"Heung-guk, how could you do this?"
Sergeant.
"Did it with this, I guess."
"Stabbed him, like, 20 times?"
Holy shit.
What's that?
Looks like the body was moved here after the murder.
What a mess.
That's Cho-the husband?
Looks that way.
I'll be damned.
And the kid?
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
So.
Cho was killed here.
- Yes.
Addons I'll give you a job.
"Addons If you tell them, or failure in duty."
"Your daughter, Sophie will die."
Bastard!
God ...
Is this life?
Tell me!
- Is he alive?
"- Yes, you want me to wake him up?"
no .. do not ..
What happened?
What did he say?
What did he say?
"Addons Dave, please use the bathroom."
Addons Use the Headset.
Addons and sat down.
Addons I have something very special for you.
Addons
- And I have to do it ...
- Because I said so.
Addons Do you want to break his arm?
Addons
- Sarah.
- Sit down.
"Addons - you can not hear, oh Romeo."
- Cursed.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
"Addons I know this is tough, but I want to think about the consequences of their actions."
Addons For you to decide if she would live.
Addons or die.
I see.
I see.
"Boy, today was so exhausting."
I had a really terrible client come.
Have a seat.
"Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear me complain."
"You're done with work, right?"
Wanna come over?
Maybe not... tonight.
"Oh, why?"
"Oh right, sorry..."
I haven't been giving you spending money lately.
What's wrong?
Take it.
I just... can't do this tonight.
Do you hate me now?
Why are you still here?
I got kind of hungry...
Let's order some sushi.
Hello.
I'm going to miss you.
Going to room 310.
Go ahead.
It's my last day.
Last day?
I'm going home to Korea.
"Here, I want you to have this."
Wait.
May I open it?
"You'll work at a top hotel, right?"
Right...
Then you'll need a bow tie.
It's hot!
Bad idea!
Bad idea!
- Put me down!
- Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Nobody panic.
We're only in here for two hours.
Four hours.
Four hours!
"""Four hours...!"""
"Oh, my God."
"You know, if you ever want to get serious about wine, you really have to lose the mustache."
"True, 'cause it gets all caught up in there."
Mm-hmm.
That makes sense.
- Yeah.
Pee-ew!
Be a lot easier if you just shaved it.
"I'd rather not, Rick."
I'm not shaving it.
I didn't bring shaving equipment.
"Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio!"
"Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying my wine, staring out the window at that... kid on a bike, going the same speed as us?"
And we are friends.
I call him Ramon.
"Hi, Ramon!"
What?
Hi!
I can't hear you.
What?
Let's give him a haircut.
Esperanza!
Don't touch me!

SANTANA:
"Zoot suit, new suit."
It sounded all the same.
I had no clue what they'd been through.
It was a mystery.
"But to be 1 6 in '59, staying away from home even if I didn't have a dime, 'cause the old man was just waiting to give me his piece of time, drove me to the street just to save my mind."
What's happening?
"Don't forget the spark plug, homes."
I'll see you guys later.
What's up?
"Hey, chico?"
BOY:

"Hey, chico, I'm not gonna make it, all right, homes?"

So for my sister.
"Mike, slow down a bit."
Listen.
Nursery with me after 20 minutes I want to buluşmanı.
Did you hear that?
I'm going there.
OK.
"I trusted you, Mike."
I got through.
Take a look at how the response has given me.
"- There is a way, I'm sure."
"- This is officially bullshit, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where, Mike?"
- $ 1 million.
Leave me and my brother.
This Agreement.
"Agreements you will not you, Mike."
I'll do it.
"The best thing you can do, is to save his brother."
"He is now the location of the statue say, let live."
"- If you do not, it dies."
I can assure you.
- Then you do 2 million.
"Damn where is sculpture, Mike?"
Get up!
I.ne you stand up!
"I i.ne damn, come on!"
"Come on, Mikey!"
Stand up!
Come on!
"- Fuck, man!"
Where?
With a friend.
"Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?"
- Is that how you like them?
- Motherfucker!
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Okay, okay."
Where were you?
"You already know, I was with Marina the whole time."
How do you know her?
I don't.
- And this one?
- Nope.
Why are you in the photo?
Must have met her that night.
Can I go now?
Get out.
That's my knife.
Take it.
They're all the same age.
Very young.
"Adela disappeared on September 14th,"
"Beatriz the 15th, Carmen and Estrella the 17th."
"In '77, '78 and '80."
During the fair.
- The town is busier.
"- People drink more, it takes longer to notice someone missing, more people meet..."
"It could be an outsider, but they all knew Quini."
- And they all wanted to leave.
- Did you see his hand?
Triangle tattoo.
Like in the photo.
- I'm coming.
- Look after Gucci.
- But you're way till Sunday!
I've got Robbie Williams tonight.
Helene says Gucci can't be left on her own.
She gets scared.
Just do it.
Then you and I can do something nice next weekend.
Can we go to mum's?
It's her birthday.
- You know I can't.
- Why not?
You know my lawyer says we mustn't see each other.
But call me.
"- Hi, Yugo Danny."
- Fuck off.
- I thought the cops had got you.
- I need your blow.
Where the hell is that coke?
About fucking time.
- What's that?
- Sherbet.
What do you think?
My blow comes in one big bag.
There were problems.
That's not 20 grams.
"As I said, problems."
You get the rest tomorrow.
No.
I want it now.
Or you give back my card.
This is Alexander's.
"Oh, you're funny!"
[HONK$]
Whoo!
She is a hottie!
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon?
"[IMITATES SVEN] Oh, you're funny!"
[MUMBLE HONKS THEN SNORTS]
You shouldn't make fun of someone just because they're different.
Especially someone who's come all this way...
- ...to save us.
- You're right.
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.

I've brought a meal foryou.

Who's the best cop now?
"- Come on, Jimmy!"
Me and you!
- Go on.
"Run, you son of a bitch."

I just want to talk to you!
"Tommy, what are you making me chase you for?"
"Come on, are you mad at me?"
I just shot my dad.
"Call me, Tommy."
"No, I'll call you."
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?
Where's Detillo?
- He's been shot!
Get off!
- I'm not getting off.
"Hardy, you son of a bitch!"
Get away from me!
You could never beat me!
You like to jump off bridges.
Who's the best cop now?
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.
"It wouldn't do any good, Eddie."
On the other hand...
Hardy!
You're okay.
Anything to drink?
No.
Water for me.
"Nothing, thanks."
"No, excuse me, uh..."
"Actually, we'll have two strawberry milkshakes, extra whipped cream."
We couldn't find you anywhere.
"You know, finally, your mom stayed up top, and I took the elevator all the way down to the ground floor."
"And I got out of the elevator, and there you were, reciting the alphabet, in French, to, uh, the security guards at the CN Tower."
"And you were little, too."
You couldn't have been more than five.
Not scared though.
"Nah, not one bit."
Heh.
Take your time.
Thank you.
Oh.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Heh.
"My, uh, wallet was in my jacket."
"Oh, no way."
Way.
Do you have money?
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Yeah.
Um...
Three and change.
That's it?
Yup.
"Mmm, not enough."
Mr. Adda!
-Yeah?
I am not Adda!
I am Chaddha!
Oh Mr. Chaddha!
"-Yeah, go on!"
"Mr. Chaddha, your goods are ready."
-Yeah.
Goods!
What kind of goods?
Where do they come from?
Who are you guys?
I guess you havent recognized us!
"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!
I think you are forgetting.
I am forgetting!
"Yes, right!"
"So guys, do one thing!"
Just forget about it!
Forget?
"What are you saying, Mr. Adda?"
Mr. Chaddha!
"Mr. Chaddha, dont do this, otherwise we will be ruined!"
..
We might die also!
-Yeah!
What can I do if you are going to die?
"Its all right, if you cant do anything!"
We want to meet your boss!
-Yeah!
Then go to right and turn to left!
Game set and match.

Six games to love.
Next match is beginning.
Singles one.
Hyotei's Atobe against Seigaku's Tezuka.
Tezuka?
Isn't he the Seigaku captain?
I can see better here.
What are you doing here when not even regulars sit here.
- Go away.
- Go away.
Oi.
"- But I'm part of the team, aren't I?"
- That's not what it is about.
Why would a fellow like you be allowed to sit on the bench!
Why aren't you on the way back to America?
You're... a pain in the ass.
Echizen.
Look after it.
'Kay.
All for Atobe!
- All for Atobe!
All for Atobe!
All for Atobe!

The winner will be... me.
This place sure is crowded.
There he is.
- Are you done?
- Stop it!
Ugh!
[glass shatters] [coughing] [panting]
"Oh, no."
Why did you make me do that?
I guess I'm on my own.
- Psst.
- There you are.
You're all right.
"- Yeah, you are too."
You're ready.
"- Yeah, I know."
That's what I was saying the whole time.
But it feels good to hear you say it.
"- Go get 'em, tiger."

"Friends, sure."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Watch it, you're only here because of me..."

"Rodney, it's beautiful."
"Here we are, snug as peas in a pod."
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.
"Hey, I'm mad at you."
"Come on, Betty."
"You really want to kiss me, don't you?"
"- Boy, do I."
- Tell me how much.
Tell me.
- Cheers.
- That's what I like.

We're your guests then?
Yes.
Do I turn left here?
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.
Since two p.m.
I've been waiting since school finished for the day.
My uncle said:
"""My friends are coming."
"Bring them to the house."""
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.
But you mustn't tell anyone.
- All right.

"If anyone asks, say we're looking for lost treasure."
Good idea.
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.

Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.

"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.

How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.

Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.

I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
Seong-bok.
I think it's the owner.
Seong-bok?
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!
Jeon Hyo-jin
You're getting all wet!

"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?

You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."

You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!

"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.
"You trust me, right?"
Take good care of the kids.
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, look, look!"
Look over there!
Go catch him!
Oh...
Hey...
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!
Let go!
Will you be okay?
Are you okay?
- Come here!
- Hey!
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.

I don't know.
RAY:
"Where does he live, goddamn it?"
JACKIE:
I don't know.
RAY:
How do you get your shit?
"I said, where does he live, bitch?"
If we told anybody where Marco lives he'd kill us.
"Well, what the fuck do you think we're going to do, huh?"
Leave us the hell alone!
Don't hit her like that.
Please tell him and everything will be okay.
Jackie don't know.
I deal with Marco.
She don't.
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.
MARCO:
Look at my face!
- What's it called?
"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.

It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles...
You make a good Batman.
"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
- Try a practical demonstration.
- It's a good idea.
Go forit!
Hurry.
- Waiter?
.
- He'II never come.
"You have to say ""oway""."
He's here.
We'd Iike to order...
We'da like...
"I don't understand a word, I'm Venetian, been here fortwo months."
Are you alright?
I Ieft you so many messages.
Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."
- I have to reorganize everything.
- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!
- How well I know you.
- I'II be back in two weeks.
Taste the pastiera.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
I heard a woman's voice.
"- It's Maria, my neighbor."
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.
- You shut up.
Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.
"Dick, you have the floor."
You have the floor.
What?
!
# What's going on here #
# What's this all about #
# What do you think you're doing #
"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always--"
"No, no, sing it!"
"No, I'm sick of singing!"
# Can you believe it?
What'd he just say?
#
# What's the matter with kids these days?
#
# Kids these days #
# Kids these days #
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"
"Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!
"Oh, my God, what was that?"
!
Did you see that?
!
"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"
!
What are you doing?
This is crazy!
"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"
Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.

- Yes.

"- Hi, boys."
"I'm Mrs. Roberts, and this is Officer Gardner."
How are you doing?
- This yours?
- No.
"- Well, how about I leave it here just in case it is?"
- Whatever.
"- Is your dad home, boys?"
- Why y'all here?
- Let's go inside.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- It's all right.
"- Look, I told you y'all can't be here, okay?"
It's just scars.
Chicks dig scars.
I love scars.
Now here we go.
"Oh, wonderful."
You're doing very good.
What?
"What's that, Larry?"
Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!
Oomph!
"No, not there."
Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.
"Come on, Marnie, you're looking for a remote control."
Suspicious.
What is?
Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.
Aahhh!
I've been caught.
What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
We are here to see--
- What is his name?
We're here--
- Vagina.
"No, we're here to see Raza."
OK.
Follow me.
"Thank you, ma'am."
"We'll follow...you, I guess."
"Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk"
"She got it, she got it"
"She got it, she got it"
"- Hey, guys."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Raza!"
- What?
What's up?
- Kumar and Roldy?
"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!
Run!
Let's go together.
I taught you to fight.
Watch out!
You have come back?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Fantastic!
Still fighting!
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody
I'd want to see
God looked down from up above
And he picked you out for me to love
He picked you out from all the rest
'Cause he knew that I loved you the very best
I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
God bless the moon and God bless me
And God bless the somebody I'd want to see
Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me on his own accord
Gave it to you?
"It's true, you don't believe me?"
Grab him
"Hey, don't move!"
You really want to fight?
"Kid, you do know some kung fu!"
This kid must be the apprentice of Zhou Sanzhao
We'll take him to Thunderstorm!
"Wait, Thunderstorm is my Master!"
How come he has an apprentice like you?
Who's that?
Who are you looking for?
Master Shi
Master!
Help!
Get me out!
Master Shi
We've got hold of Zhou's apprentice
We'll let you handle this
Good!
"This bastard, let me question him!"
"T ake a seat, Master!"
Help!
let me out!
"Master, it's me!"
It's Gao Jian!
"Gao Jian, what happened?"
"Master, I...they..."
What exactly has happened?
"Master, these three assholes"
"I told them I'm your apprentice, they ignored me"
(Laughing)
You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."
(Radio playing music)
(Dance music on television)
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
"Ok, I'm gonna call 911."
"Come on, pick up that goddamn phone."
I think I need something to eat.
"Please hang up, and try your call again."
"Please hang up now, this is a recording."
"Please hang up, and tr..."
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!
They are all dead!
My entire family is... dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
"Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello?"
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
He would've gone in search of his father.
- What did you say now?
- My foot!
"You watch cartoons on laptop, he would've left your area along with his father."
"This place is my fortress, I'll get him at any cost."
"Enough of searching there, come on boys."
"Come on boys,"
Find him whether he is here.
Search inside.
- Playing cards?
- How much?
- 250
- Calm!
"Drinks, cards, you need any woman?"
May I send one?
- He's here!
- Who?
Your Godfather!
Singamuthu's son!
He beat my partner.
Hey Konda Reddy!
Has my son come here?
How could I judge it?
I can get it from your scared face.
You're shivering.
You're sweating profusely.
Konda Reddy is scared because my son is here!
"Yes, he has come!"
But he'll not go alive from here.
Come on boys!
Get up!
Come!
Flank right.
Don't move!

You're an even bigger fool than your mother.
"Say whatever you want to me, Jeanine."
But I'm not gonna fight you.
How very Amity of you.
I mean it.
I'm not gonna fight you.
Of course you're not.
You're gonna fight her.

I'm the real you.

I'm not gonna fight you.
I'll make you fight me.
You're not me.
I am.
I'm what they see when they look at you.
You killed Will.
And your parents.
You're deadly.
That's enough!
"No one's gonna love you, Tris."
They're never even gonna miss you.

No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
Thanks.
Is that it?
We shouldn't be doing this as partners.
- We should be taken out and shot.
- We should shoot each other.
- Too much paperwork.
"- I'm serious, Tommy."
"Well, maybe you're in the wrong job."
Tommy?

What's the matter?
THIRD VICTIM IN 3 RIVERS MURDER CASE
Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.
I used to call her Connie.
- You knew this girl too?
- I took her to the prom.
Amazing coincidence...
me knowing all these girls.
You knew about the nurse.
Now you know about Cheryl.
And now Connie.
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who?
Who can I trust?
I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?
- Say I told the wrong person.
- You didn't do this.
- Why?
ls it an obvious frame?
"Nice kicks, by the way."
Where did you get them?
Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.
- I had my publicist put me on the list.
- They sound great.
"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.
- No.
Sure.
- Right on.
"I'll need your info, though."
I'm so sorry.
"You're Dr. Phillip, right?"
From Tempest Bay?
- That's me.
"- I know it's completely hicksville,"
- but would you sign my gym bag?
- Sure.
No problem.
Thanks.
"Oh, my God."
My mom's gonna flip out.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"- Too bad it's always moms, right?"
- Yeah.
Bummer.
- He was hitting on me.
- You are so full of yourself.
Ah.
I think our table is ready.
"We should just sit right down, I think."
"Yes, thank you."
To the buzzer.
A Sports Illustrated moment.
I actually think I got hit by Kobe's sweat when he took the shot.
Nice.
You still down for hanging out?
Sure.
"Uh, do you..."
you know a bar around here?
Let's skip the bar.
Too many drunken fans.
Fine by me.
What did you want to do?
Let's get out of here.
Take a drive up Mulholland.
- Mulholland?
- My girlfriend's out of town.
- I don't have a curfew.
Hop in.
"Lt'll be fun, I promise."
That is a beautiful watch.
I have three sons and a brother.
Always looking for good gift ideas.
- Where did you buy it?
- Fred Segal's.
- Oh.
- Did their Christmas display last year.
An homage to 1940s noir.
Hm.
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
Mmm.
I like to eat the top off the varri-cake first.
I just try to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once.
I love our job.
Huh?

"Oh, no, circuits not working."

It seems like this mover is really getting to you.
You do know Juji's not really dead?
Of course I know.
Juji's fine.

"No, it's not real."

It looks real.
"Come on, it's a reality."
There are millions of people watching us right now.
Addons Now that the penalty completed.

"I don't know, probably some schmuck from one of the tours."
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
"Yeah, how do we know we're not asking a ballerina, or a lawyer, or a math teacher to take off her clothes?"
We just got to go for it.
"Frank, I think I need to see the money."
"Excuse me, miss, do you have a minute?"
"Uh, ma'am?"
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a prostitute?
What?
Will you take your clothes off for $103.62?
"Thanks, Kevin."
What?
What'd I do?

You guys need some help?
Are you talking to us?
Yeah.
We want to see a naked lady.
"Ooh, how much money you got?"
$103.62.

Come on.

"Come on, come on, come on."
Where?
There are naked women in here?
"Guys, you got to trust me."

There's no evidence he ever cheated on his wife.
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.
When do you have your lunch with him?
With Shelly Runyon?
I'm not having lunch with him.
"Friday, 1:00."
It's scheduled tomorrow.
It's automatic.
He's committee chairman.
It was set up.

- Shelly.
I'm sorry I started.
You were late.

- Were you tied up with anything?
"- No, sorry."
I'm just late.
"- Hi, Clem."
You too.
"- Senator, nice to see you."
- I ordered you the porterhouse.
"- No, I don't eat meat."
- I'll have the penne.

Mmm.

So is that why you stopped fighting and moved out to this bumfuck town?
I didn't stop fighting.
And I certainly didn't move here.
I had no choice.
What do you mean? I'm in the witness protection program.
Just stay in bed.
Leave me alone!
It's great the way you sell yourself.
Why me?

He was out looking for you to help.

Many wind up all alone.
What are you after?
Nothing.
I just do my job.
"Get up, lazybones!"
"- Say: ""Morning, Dad""."
"- Morning, Dad."
And give him a kiss.
No school today?
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.
"Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday."
Mom in?
Rushing as usual.
Hello?
Meet me in the Brooklyn Navy yard.
You'll see some cranes there.
Go to crane number five.
Crane five.
"If you're not alone, I'm gonna have to kill you."
"That'll be 3:00 am, tomorrow morning..."
Dalton.
"Okay, eastland."
[Indistinct radio chatter]
Did you get a trace?
"No, it was too short."
Thanks for the tap.
[Car door closing]
[Clattering]
[Banging]
[Gunfire]
That's what it's like to be a victim.
That's what it was all about.
[Gunshot]
[Groaning]
"I had to do it, Dalton, huh?"
"You guys were gonna set me up, huh?"
"Come on, Dalton..."
Let's get out of here.
I'll help you... come on.
"No, no, you get out of here."
Don't play hero with me.
Let's just go.
Damn it!
You get out of here!
I'll cover you.
"Oh, same old, same old."
You?
Yep.
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.
What happened?
Where is she?
"Well, you were right."
We shouldn't have left.
No.
Hungry?
"Next time, you'll listen to me."
I'm home.
"Teeth brushed, ready for bed."
Safe and sound.
"Oh, good, good."
I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
"No, no, no."
Uh...
Not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?"
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
- Such a liar.
"- No, I'm serious."
"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.
Run for your life!
Oh!
Keep away!
- Take it!
- Keep away!
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!
Candy!
Yay.
Treats.
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, daddy!"
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad..."
"- Daddy, daddy, daddy."
You're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair!
"Oh, did you see?"
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"Oh, that's all right, sweetie."
Mommy didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think... someone's inside?
My God.
What...
You wouldn't want to be listening to that fella.
I only told you 'cause...
"I don't know why I told you, really."
You were right.
It's pathetic.
A grown man talking like that.
Exactly.
Just 'cause she's up the pole.
Exactly.
It's stupid.
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to be getting... worked up about it.
"Still, though..."
It's just...
I heard something.
I thought I should warn you.
- Warn me?
"- Yeah, warn you."
"You know your man, George Burgess?"
What about Mr. Burgess?
He was saying things.
Not to me face.
It was Lester who told me.
He was saying things... about you being pregnant.
What was he saying?
He said... he said you were a great little ride.
"So Lester says, anyway."
"Lester wouldn't make a thing up like that, would he?"
"Jesus, no."
Not Lester.
- Did you enjoy the flowers?
That was it.
The flowers.
It had to be.
Roger had hidden the money here in the gardens where he used to work.
Magnum!
What are you tryin' to do?
Ruin me?
Turn around!
Turn around!
It must be the ruddy heat.
I saw it happen several times in India.
I remember once when the raja of Punjab was racing elephants... in July on the Tigris Plain.
There was this rogue bull.
"Come on, will ya, Higgins?"
He got behind the raja's elephant and tried to mount him.
"Uh, the elephant, not the raja."
Extraordinary.
Hold it.
"Hold it, T.C. There's his bike."
Magnum!
Let's split up.
I'm gonna go this way.
Okay.
Heliconia caribaea.
Fascinating.
In the north it's commonly now called lobster claw.
Alpinia.
Indigenous to New Guinea.
Marvelous.
Ah.
Alpinia oceanica.
You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.
"Yeah, what's up?"
What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.
"I'll be right there, okay?"
Sorry.
"Hey... 2 beers, please."
Recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter.
Got it?
She's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie?
"This is Marc, the friend I told you about."
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her.
You really just want to talk?
What if she doesn't want to?
- What?
Go back to her old man?
Will you leave her alone?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
"- Man, I have my rights."
"- What do you mean, your rights?"
"Who's the boss here, huh?"
"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
- I am.
- You are?
- What are you doing here?
Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.
"Don't talk back to me, man."
What are you doing here?
"- We saw the car, man."
- You heist this car?
No.
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
"- All of you, come on."
- Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.
"You dumb spics, get outta here!"
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!
[Police Radio Chatter]
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.
- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
We're gonna miss out on all this money.
- Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
- I know.
Come on.
You could kick...
You-You could kick that guy's ass.
You think?
"Oh, my God."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know."
I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
- You almost hurt him once.
- With the bottle?
"- Yeah, and that's next to impossible."
- That was good.
- You're...
You're good.
- I am good.
Yeah.
Tell you what.
Um...
Why don't you go stretch out.
I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Goddamn it.
"- Frankie, what's the deal?"
- She got arrested.
- Ah!
I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
- So we'll never get the fight.
- Could be a bad thing.
- Tara!
"See ya on ""Trisha""."
I was thinking of asking you to speak at the school.
Speak?
About drugs.
Speak about drugs?
To the kids.
Speak to the kids about drugs?
They need to hear about the harsh realities 'cause... people talk so much shit about drugs.
Yeah.
I know I do.
Half your sixth form come round here anyway.
You could call a register here some weeks.
"Ah, now, that's another good topic."
What's it like working from home?
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Well, the hours are terrible, but then I hardly do owt."
So it balances itself out.
"Jesus! ""Hellraiser III:"
"Hell On Earth""."
"- It's been a while, lads."
"- Been off on tour, haven't we?"
"- Been having some mad times, y'know."
Mad.
- Mad!
"- Hello, Miss."
- Lee.
Jason.
Miss.
- How are you both?
- Wicked.
I'll look for her later!
I was dead.
"I mean,"
I was really dead.
Really.
Tell me about it.
What's it like to be dead?
I'd got loose.
It were as if I was getting out of my body.
"My body was staying here, and I..."
I was flying.
You were floating?
Yes.
"I heard that dog, and a woman screaming."
"They were around me, panicking and... then I heard that noise."
It was like a whistle.
"A very, very loud whistle."
I saw... a light.
A light?
Yes.
It was alive.
It was alive as if it were waiting for me.
I was in the light.
I felt good.
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.
But you did come back.
Yes.
Why did you come back?
I just did.
Something made you come back.
Is there something you're holding back?
"She can't recognise anyone, she can't speak."
What did the doctor say?
That there's no hope.
- The doctor said that?
- Yes.
Who's watching her?
"My mother, the neighbours, the family, my young uncle."
Your young uncle?
He's called in three times.
His holidays are over.
My grandmother's better.
How old is she?
100... 150... 100 or 150?
100.
Special rate?
Yes.
"After one hundred, the rest doesn't matter."
Do you know that or not?
I don't know.
"We grow old, you know."
"I have to go, I have exams."
I'll be back.
Come back quickly.
Don't forget.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
"Hello, are you well?"
Are you looking for something?
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.
You didn't lock the car.
"One night has passed, you expect it to be there?"
"Hello, good luck."
-Damn she is!
Nonstrips water?
This one is talking nonsense
You do not like the serenades?
We are artists.
Now we are wet artists.
"-A moment, I have an idea."
-What?
"Iros, wait for me in billiards, I are in charge."
You wait for me there.
"Iros, iros."
"God, I am all wet."
You enter?
you are oxidized?
-We do not have oil?
-It closes and it starts.
"-Good evening, Italia."
"-Ah, Moroni, you are."
"Yes, you have to understand that they are only kidding and I have come to apologize."
Créame.
"Of agreement, it happens, You are all wet."
Thanks.
"I am going to dry you, give me the jacket."
"Thanks, you are very kind."
-Sit down.
-Thanks.
-Thanks to take the annoyance.
"-One does not worry, dry."
Thanks.
"I hope, hearing."
Italy.
"When I saw you with Ciotti, I became crazy from jealousy."
Wu-tang!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Jun-kit...
Our students used to learn kung-fu as Shaolin monks.
Any better now?
"Yes, Master!"
Fung-wu!
Do all our students understand the mystery of the sword?
"Yes, Master!"
They all understand!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Let's get together tonight at the old place.
I'll be the host.
"No, I should be the host!"
I will be the host!
I'll be the host!
I've told you I'll be the host!
I'll be the host!
Don't argue!
No...
I will!
Don't argue!
"I'll be the host, do you hear?"
Fung-wu...
What's happened to you?
There's nothing to argue about!
Don't snatch!
Who's the host really?
I am!
I am!
"Fung-wu, try to use our sword skills!"
"Jun-kit, attack him with the Shaolin fist!"
- Not for idea.
"Yes, yes."
- Not gonna happen.
"Strength, me dia."
"Then, Mr. Duncan Lloyd..."
Are you serious?
- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!
Duncan Lloyd!
It's me!
Dragan!
OMG.
"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?
Get your camcorder and movie.
"Dragan, brother."
- Duncan the Beone.
My friend.
Good.
"You haven,t eaten, I hope."
- Nice trip?
- Us?
"We got lost at first, but after that it was easy."
"Here,s the paperwork."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, against the wall, please."
Very good.
Now undress.
"That,s right - undress."
"Lab coats off, shoulders against the wall."
"Jean-MicheI, tell us how you met."
Me or...
"Sure, CIaudine."
"At some friends, dinner party."
"I hadn,t really noticed him."
"But at a certain point our eyes met,"
",cause we were both bored."
- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.
",We got to know each other, Iike in the song."
What song?
By Hugues Aufray.
could you sing it for us?
"No, not Iike this."
REFUSES TO SING
- How about you?
"- I don,t know it."
I can always make a new one.
I'd rather lose my engine than seeing it misused by a villain.
This is it.
Here I go.
"I do this and this, and then..."
"Professor, here we come!"
"Oh, no!"
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Wait!
"He has the devil's luck, indeed."
Did you see that?
Two planes are leading.
Mac's and Hudson's.
Everybody's here.
Dear!
Helen!
Here.
Congratulations on your victory.
"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."
I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.
I bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
Ouch...
Shall we raise our glasses?
Cheers!
"Professor... we completely blew it, didn't we?"
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"Three, judge."
"Thank you, judge."
Three for the judge.
Ten dollars.
I'll let you off with a light sentence.
Pair of nines.
Pair of dogs.
"I didn't know you had a twin brother, judge."
"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"
I suppose I ought to say thanks.
I don't know the party.
Ho!
[playing piano]
"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."
-Like;
"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.
"-Brock said he was lucky again, Papa."
-Really;
That's funny.
-Looks to me like the boys took him.
-They tried.
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
- What the fuck?
- Come on!
"Down, set, go!"
TTD:
"There it is, right there."
"Put it on, quarterback!"
"Aw, shit!"
"Man, chase his ass."
Chase him.
- Get him!
What are you smiling for?
"- Dude, run!"
Y'all take five.
Good play.
Take five.
- Come here.
- Where the hell are you throwing?
"Sorry, Rick."
You know what a skinny post is?
"Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?"
"Man, we don't even call plays at my school."
School?
What you... you in...
what school you go to?
- Miami-Dade High.
- You in high school?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Really?
I'ma really kick your ass if you don't get to step...
Get out of here.
"T, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"We got Amendola, Gronk, and Edelman working with Brady."
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"
Head this way.
"What'd they say, 5 people on"
This floor?
"I said 5, 5."
Whoa.
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.
Raghunath.
He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.
Shiv.
Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.
Get out of here.
There's no place for a murderer in Dharam kunj.
From today you're dead for me and for all of us.
You're dead!
You're dead!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
So Boss.
You should've called me instead uncle.
No no it's always the needy that come to the provider.
How can someone like you be sulking?
Thank God.
Idiot!
What's up bro?
"A busy day, huh?"
How is your aunt Shukran?
I want to visit heragain but she neverpicks up the phone.
She is still looking for a job.
I told her.
She could work here.
She can't...
Her new boyfriend is overly jealous.
Anyway...
Bitch.
Don't be late.
I hold yourroom free the whole day.
"Madam, it is every Turkish men's duty to serve his country as a soldier."
Yourson is no exception but he is a draft dodger.
Concealing his whereabouts is a crime...
Listen son.
Can's father died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
Can's brotheralso joined the army and he is burnt out now.
Can is not a draft dodger...
Anyway...
Let me sign and leave...
Cihan!
Cihan.
"Wake up, son."
Mom...
Son.
Get up.
Mom...
They came back for yourbeloved son.
He's in the Army.
At Angelras.
That so?
Is cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
"And Richard, you either tell me right now what's got your brother so riled up, or I end this goddamn thing right now!"
Tell him.
"Tell him, or I'll show him."
- Show him what?
- [Richie sighs]
She's a... a...
What she means  is that she's not a...
"Say goodbye, Reina!"
You're goin' home!
[grunts]
Ah!
[roaring]
What the... ?
So that's what you were tryin' to tell me.
That's not all.
[roaring] [grunting]
"Oh, this is some serious B-movie shit."
[gagging] [gun clicking]
Ah!
[Groans]
- [Eddie shouts]
- What the hell are you doing?
Gotta take care of this son of a bitch old school!
"- Come on, you bastard!"
- Eddie!
Ahh!
[grunts]
- [Richie] Whoa!
"- [Seth] Hang on, Eddie, we're gonna..."
- We're gonna get you help.
"- Hey, Eddie, don't move."
"Just look at me, man."
The worst for me.

Okay.
Okay.
"There, I can not ..."
I used to come here on holiday with my father and my mother.
"My father died there, in that room."
A shot in the barn.
But I still ment.
It was hung?
No.

But she is raging mad.
What is?
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.
Cupping.
Cupping?
Yeah.
"You know, I thought it was gonna hurt, but honestly, I snoozed through the whole thing."
"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.
[ Laughs ]
"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
"[ Laughs ] Evelyn, you are looking great."
Just 10 more pounds till your goal weight.
Do you mind if I borrow my wife for a sec?
I'll be back.
[ Chuckles ]
"Looking good, ladies."
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
The new guys aren't personal trainers.
What are you talking about?
I did a little digging.
I found this in their glove compartment.
They're Feds?
Worse.
They're hunters.
Why are hunters here?
[engine starts]
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"[Rocky] hey, wait for me."
"[dazzler] come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
- [door shuts]
- I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, yo-yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
[laughs] this bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."

"Hey, hey, I know you."
Squirrel boy.
Hogarth.
"By night, known as Hogarth."
Got it.
"Well, come on inside, kid."
Sorry about the crowbar.
You'd be surprised how many people wanna steal scrap.
"But, man, once I turn it into art, I can't give it away."
"I mean, what am I?"
A junkman who sells art or an artist who sells junk?
You tell me.
HOGARTH:
I like it...
I think.
"Listen, you're, you're not gonna call my mom, are you?"
She doesn't know I'm out.
I...
"Don't worry, kid."
"Look, it's not my style to report a guy to the authorities."
(GIANT MAKING SOUNDS)
DEAN:
Wait here.
I'm going to go get the old man.
"Jimmy, don't go."
I was wrong.
I thought you were my friend.
"Ciao, Jimmy!"
"Hey, I'm here to see Maria, Maria Concetta."
- Jimmy?
"- We'll talk later, alright?"
- Don't go.
- Jimmy.
Relax Captain.
Get in line like everybody else...
- What are you waiting for?
"- The virgin of Naples, isn't it?"
Bullshit!
I hear she even does it with horses.
- How was it?
- Save your money.
Put it into war bonds.
I'd stick it anywhere if I could just find a hole.
"My god, all the quim that isn't being used... and you keep jacking off."
"Confucius says: ""Pussy everyday gets old""."

"Enough, enough!"
Relax...
You want to screw her?
Impossible.
You want to be with her?
"- Ha ha, idiot."
This person must be mute.
"Saa, who knows."
I'm just too ignorant.
"Hey, you guys are noisy."
Na?
What did you say chibi?
The one you were talking about just now was the Eastern grip.
Eastern grip?
It's really common just for people like you.
Did you said something wrong?
How old are you?
- Junior High student?
- Middle School student?
Looks like you know a lot.
Get off the next stop.
Mada mada da ne.
Who's that?
Good afternoon!
Thanks for the hard work!
Oi chibi.
We are not recruiting.
Wait chibi.
What is your name?
I'm asking you for your name.
Could it be you are that transfer student named Echi something?
Answer me.
Echizen Ryoma.
So it is.
The prodigy from America.
Show me what you've got.
And you are?
I can fly?
"-Erik, please."
-The boy seeks the larger truth.
"If you want, must desire."
"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!
Bye!
Son.
Erik.
"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.
And we are all different part of life to know who is and what their gifts.
You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.
Got it?
"Yes, that's okay."
Great.
"-Will, what is this?"
It's the wave of change.
"The world is changing, Bill."
We have to get in on.
"My god, can not be."
Something somewhere gave the greatest hustle.
Something hit the land of the emperors.
"Come on, children."
Let's push the pace.
"-It's our time, Bill."
-Right.
"Swimming-and-death, my friend."
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?

"Under Major Hogan's orders, I held Torrecastro long enough to effect an uprising."

"Lord, you mistake."
I was in the bathroom.
There I got the message.
What message?
"""Do not let your life."""
He said that he killed if it does not do what it says.
I can not afford it.
I can not let that happen.
I just what to do.
He killed my mother.
I killed them all.
All dead.
To Alice.
Please!
"If you fly, many will die and more innocent people."
People die every day but not my family.
"Please, this is crazy."
God knows what we can do.
What about him?
I'm sorry.
"Addons Ten minutes before impact, Mr. Calahan."
Do not.
Please.
Addons One listen to one of the poisoning helping our friend?
Or go back to the cabin Addons
- I keep my wife and kids?
Do not listen.
Addons
- Please.
- Who wants to die first?
Addons - wife or child.
Yes.
And absolutely the best car in this garage?
- Lime green 'cuda.
- This American shit?
"Point is, I'm a good guy."
"Oh, no, you're a bad guy, sweetheart."
But...
I keep your secret.
[Singsongy] Bad guy.
There's no secrets.
"See you later, bad guy."
Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?
[Under breath] Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Watching my girlfriend.
I got some bad news.
Your girlfriend's marrying that creepy old dude.
That's just her Dad.
- She was kissing him.
- You kiss Dad.
Not like that.

"[Candy rattles, bowls thuds]"
I cannot tell you how excited my baby is right now.
So I'm not familiar with Jewish weddings.
Is there anything special?
A request you might have?

What you doing?
When did you come here?
"Anyway, get out."
"Scared you, didn't I?"
"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?
"- It hurts, it hurts."
You're early.
The English test turned out bad.
- No doubt about that.
It was horrible.
- I thought it was okay.
- Get some sleep.
- My car's in Grant Park with a flat.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.
I'll grab you a cab.
Come on.

- Thanks.

- Yeah.
"- Oh, there he is."

Dr. Ross!
"- Over here, Dr. Ross."
"- Can we have a statement, Dr. Ross?"

Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?
I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together.
We're still working it out.
"Oh, he's a good cop, apparently."
It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."
- Approaching now.
- Copy that.
Wait till he's past the jetty then head in with the light on.
What's he doing?
"Oh, Jesus."

Stop!

Put your weapon down.
You're surrounded.
They set me up!
Rrar!
Let's go.
"Go, go, go."
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."

- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?

- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?

He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.

You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"

"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?

- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.

- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."

How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."

Shit!
What the hell!

"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I--
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable... even foryou."
"Ofcourse, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter ofthe great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange... for someone even better.
"- Eric, what are you doing?"
"- Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Enough.
Do you want vada?
You mean firebrand?
OK
Hey why is a thread coming out of it?
-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.
- You stitched it?
Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?

A lawyer?

Can you raise your voice?

It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
"Now, let's go!"
- Good!
"- Luth, let's go home early!"
- Why not?
It only takes one!
"I tell you, Tiny, you got to let him in on it!"
There's no percentage in smartening up a chump!
- But what if he gets in a lucky punch?
- Stick to your buckets!
I'll do the thinking!
"- You ready, Stoker?"
- Never felt better!
Good!
Let's go!
"Looks like we get home early, all right!"
"Hey, why don't you stop that?"
Cheating on yourself!
Good crowd!

Thou hast sent him gifts?
No.
You have offered him flowers?

Yes!

What is proof of your great love?
"It is you, florist Melanie."

Always has been.
Good night.
What about the mouth thing we'd talked about?
- Mouth thing?
- I want to show off my new skills.
- Not right now.
- Go to sleep and I'll go to work.
- Can't we just...
"- Okay, I'll back off."
Sleep tight.
- I'm not ready for the tournament.
- You sure aren't.
- Did you give Mia head then?
- You're disrupting my swing!
It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
- I feel weird.
- I can't breathe.
- Did you take something?
- Franz gave me a pill.
- Simon's with your sister.
In the VIP Lounge.
You can't allow that.
"- Go home, Luise."

Mum will freak if she hears you came here on a school night.
Go home.
- I hate you.
- Go home.
And you come with me.
Move over.
- Where are you going?
- For a wash.
- Will you be back?
- Maybe.
You bastard!
She's my little sister!
Why did you do that magazine?
- Can't you just forget it?
- It was so way out of line.
- I don't regret it.
- So you'd do it again?
- If I have to.
- I don't need shit like this.
Keep your hands off Luise.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
- Please don't be too rough.
- Haven't you done it before?
- Oh baby.
- I missed you so much.
"I missed you too, my darling."
I've missed you too.
We're gonna do that.
We're gonna swing.
We're going to be a family again.
Always.
"Marcus,"
Will you take me back?
"well, i don't know."
- That's all right.
- I need to think about it a little bit.
- Oh.
Oh.

I thought about it.
Yes.

It's ridiculous!
- I'll never take it!
- What's so bad about it?
I won't even hear about it!

What?
No!

Oh!

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HEY.
THAT ROBOT MOVED ON ITS OWN.
"YO, KID."
CAN YOU MOVE?
I WANT A PHOTO OF THE BURNS FAMILY OF HEROES.
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]
[ SIGHS ]
Why would you be doing that?
You got a really good face.
Bullshit.
Don't give me that.
"No, no, really."
You got some great character--
Who are you doing this for?
Seriously.
"Just for practice, just for the heck of it."
This is what I do.
"I sit here all day, and I draw--"
- You've been here all day?
- ...people as they come by.
"All day, yeah."
"And you draw other people, too."
"- Yeah, plenty of them."
- Let me see.
I can't because actually I gave them the pictures.
Would you like your picture?
- You'll give it to me?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
All yours.
Enjoy.
Okay.
"Sorry about that, man."
You just never know.
- You know what I mean?
- It's not a problem.
- Enjoy it.
"- Okay, buddy."
I haven't stuttered once in over six weeks.
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia?
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
No!
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?
no.
Huh.
"- Ricky, my husband."
Ricky.
- Is he Italian?
"- No, it's just a nickname."
I gave it to him a longtime ago.
Any kids?
You're still young.
What are you looking for?
Our father.
And who is that?
What did you want from me?
Are you Algerian?
- Not any more.
- Jewish?
No.
Muslim?
Christian?
Why is it so important?
Because we need to know why they separated you from our mother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Dorona, what do you want from me?"
This is your mother and this is you.
"Very beautiful woman, your mother."
She's obviously very brave.
How did she die?
An operation.
"Are you angry with her, Dorona?"
Don't be angry with her.
Don't cry my love.
I'm going back soon.
I moved my flight up.
Why did you come?
The Prime Minister amended a few things.
"By the way, firm handshake is customary in Turkey."
It's so short now.
Brussels insisted on being brief.
"Apparently, after my speech in Scotland."
I thought I improvised well.
Very well.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, I think you should refrain from comments."
Excuse me.
Your Majesty?
Of course.
I'll take care of it.
I will see to it.
I will.
"Goodbye, Your Majesty."
"Sire, the press conference in Miniatürk starts at 11 a.m."
"Your speech, Sire."
The Prime Minister amended a few things.
"By the way, firm handshake is customary in Turkey."
Thank you.
Perfect.
It's time.
"We should go, Sire."
It's really small.
The Atomium?
That's a flop.
No.
"Well, yes."
Look at the tiny space for the European monuments...
As if Europe is Turkey's annex.
Mr. Moreau.
"She can,t stand me."
"No, you,ve got her all wrong."
"She only seems cold and serious because she,s a scientist."
"She,s not really mean."
"You don,t think so?"
What did you do today?
Today?
Let me see.
I tested steering wheels and pens.
How was it?
Okay.
Steering wheels?
How was your day?
I made -
I was in the kitchen.
Did you see the results?
"There weren,t any."
It was just these guys who were there with different stuff.
careful.
Not under there.
Why not?
"I think tonight we,d better not."
Why not?
"I,m sure we,re covered with wires for a reason."
"CIaudine, you get 400 francs for this week,s groceries."
"Buy only what,s necessary."
You have 30 minutes.
Go.
You chose ariel.
What about two boxes of Dash instead?
Okay.
- Or three boxes of Omo?
Hallelujah.
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.
- You okay?
- Sure.
Is this what you really want?
Do I have a choice?
Molly?
"Molly, do you know where you are?"
You're in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.
We're taking very good care of you.
You like my ring?
"I know you're scared, but I'll stay with you."
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.
"Okay, let's extubate her."
Carter....
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs.
Gases are good.
All right.
Excellent.
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.
Make sure the cuff is down before you extubate her.
Good.
"Now, what I want you to do is pretend you're blowing out your birthday candles."
Take another big breath.
"When I say go, blow out real hard, okay?"
Go.
- Nice.
I'm inside.
Be careful.
Marilyn could come home at any minute.
"Okay, Ricky."
Oh my.
"Marnie, what are you doing?"
I'm dusting for fingerprints.
And a little dirt.
"Come on, Marnie."
Looks for something that looks like a clue.
"Sorry, Ricky."
Let's start looking right now.
It's a very scary foyer.
I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
"With you in a minute, Granville."
What is it?
Is me slip showing?
I bet there's a hole in me tights!
"No, no."
"Calm down, Julie."
Everything's fine.
"Well, almost f--f--fine."
Have you ever thought about m--modelling?
Have you ever thought of g--getting me out?
-
"- Modelling, Mr Arkwright?"
-
- Yes.
-
- I don't think I'd be any good.
-
- Under my supervision and guidance.
-
- I were never any good before.
-
- You've done it before?
Oh.
L--l--I think I should s--say s--straightaway that I could only offer you a f--fraction of the g--going rate.
I didn't realise you had m--m--m--modelled before.
I'm still here!
-
- It's been quite a while.
-
- My feelings exactly!
I think it were in Standard Four.
I made a gnome out of Plasticine.
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
Let's see what's down there.
(FOOTSTEPS CLANGlNG)
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"(MUTTERS) Oh, my God!"
EMERSON:
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
-Brown.
"-Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
"Before you dropped out, huh?"
MAN:
There you are.
(david YELLS)
EMERSON:
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
A convention of predators?
"-There, there!"
-Why was not I invited?
-Will.
"-Guys, guys?"
-Will not go ...
-Get out.
-You will not survive.
Me misses.
Will stop.
I think the best part.
"If I'm invading your space, How about this?"
"No, no, I'm talking about, separated from truth."
More ...
Why?
My life is like now.
"I can change, be less invisible."
"See, you'll be great."
"See you, kid."
"Will, please do not let me."
"I'll take you, you, you, and you."
"Please, someone, anyone, I lost my Will."
"I beg you, please Will my return."
-Mano.
-Sven.
"-I will give to his wife, okay."
"-Okay, thank you."
"Right Sven, here I come."
Form a single queue and smiled.
You must be glorious.
And you must be Sven.
"It is a pleasure for me to know, seriously because I'm thrilled."
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
You understand me?
You hear me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it.
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
Why are you bugging me?
I know what to do.
"You little hick, just make sure you do it."
You can be such a pain.
- Hey!
Just do it!
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."
- I'm keeping score in my head.
"You said you were open to loving some games, right?"
- Come on.
"- Play the game, Mags."
"Get up there, let's game it up."
- [overlapping chatter]
"- All right, games."
- Yay.
- There she is.
Team of one.
Team of one.
Let's do it.
- All right.
- Here we go.
"You're gonna crush it, Mags."
"Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh."
"Okay, everybody's forgotten about you!"
"You're all alone, you're all alone!"
Your only friend's an old man!
Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.

We will earn millions!

We will definitely get those orders.

Oh brother!

"What, sir?"

"Chloe, the magical waitress Chloe from Albuquerque, or Donny, the angry busboy who shot Luke ?"
I'll go with Chloe on that one.
Good.
That's what I figured.
That's what I figured.
Okay.
Okay.

"Sadie, the tough as nails yet soulful jewelry maker or Lindsay, my grandfather's illegitimate, bookish love child ?"
"I can't, Seth."
Sure... sure you can.
It's very easy.
Go on.
Just go.
I'm not going to go alone.
"We need help, man."
I need help.
"Just sit me down, okay ?"
All right.
"Okay, but I'm going to come right back."
I know.
Do you hear that ?
No.
Exactly.
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.
Or... maybe they're just faking us out.
There we go.
Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.
"Taylor, a gun ?"
Where did you get that ?
"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

You were in a coma.
I can't feel my legs.
Don't worry.
It will gradually come back.
Do you know your name?
I think.
So?
Lucy Clarsen.
Do you remember what happened to you?
What is it?
Why are you staring at me?
You're a miracle.

268)}There's nothing more we can do.
The plant is flooded.
268)}You can't just leave.
You said... 268)}You should do the same.
There's no point in staying.
There must be something we can do.
Nope.
We tried everything.
The power won't come back.
Crowbar.
What the hell are you doing?
Please have a seat.
I have nothing to offer.
Will the power be back soon?
You can come to the Helping Hand.
We have a generator. and dorm rooms if you need to stay.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.
"Oh, thanks, Ethan."
"Thanks so much, buddy."
We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice.
But we love juice.
Are you kids okay?
"Oh, we're just great, thanks."
Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Why are you out of breath?
"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.
"Oh, I'm so poor."
And why are you in your underwear?
Because I am rich.
There's been a burglary.
Somebody stole my chocolate!
I am very shocked by that.
"Okay, what was rule number two?"
Always believe in yourself?
No!
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.

Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..
you go to the end of the West Colonnade.
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
You think I put my country through this for money?
I hate mercenaries.
It's about time.
I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..
Weapon system unlocked.
Enter presidential launch code.
"Mr. President, please wake up, wake up."
Please!
"Sir, we're at DEFCON 1."
The nuclear football in the White House went live.
That's impossible.
It's happening.
I can not hear you!
Does your heart hurt?
Let me have a look.
"The old warriors believed, that the heart was sacred."
"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.
"You disappoint me, Bishop."
I expected much more from Mara's husband.
You are more trash than the man.
Barbarous and cruel.
A daughter.
"Our daughter, Mara."
"Come on, Bishop."
Follow me.
How can you leave us alone ?
!
Are you my daughter?
My name is Aluxia.
I have been waiting for you.
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?
Not quite.
Just tired.
You've been dreaming.
Yes.
And you were there.
I do not want to get lost.
"- Leave it alone, Aluxia."
- Ok dad.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."
[Tunes radio to Greek music]
Here it comes.
There.
Look at that.
You like it?
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.
Lord?
Lord?
Ludovic and Louise were immersed in the protocol.
"Meanwhile, that little brother had returned to being a puppet."
"Sire, here's a clean shirt."
I see.
Agree.
Goodbye.
"Mr. Lloyd, the palace has canceled Our King."
-Otherwise you are very nice.
-To your health.
"When our official delegation comes here, we will bring you a decoration."
You golden boy!
I will mount the little horse...
Sing with me.
When I join the army
Everyone!
"And you, my dear"
-Call me Pepa.
"-Hi, Pepa."
-What should I call you?
"-Whatever you like, Pepa."
"-For example, can I call you monster?"
"-You can, Pepa."
-And I will also call you monster.
"-Call me monster 2,"
-so there's order in it.
"-Bye, monsters."
"Bye, Pepa."
"Boys, I like you."
Yirinka!
These are my friends from space.
"Nice to meet you, I'm the princess of Monaco."
They are just flying back.
Cheers.
"-Cheers, Pepa."
"-Cheers, monsters."
Well?
Do they congratulate us?
I'm looking forward to going home.
"We'll get bonuses, I'll buy new aquarium, feed the fish, and have peace and quiet."
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
"Oh, it's Wayne."
How are you now?
"Oh, not so bad."
"Yeah, this one's too hard."
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)
We don't have time to discuss that business.
Devon.
Stewart.
I come in peace.
How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock?
You don't.
Speak.
Do not approach.
- Seen Katy around?
- No.
- That is all.
- (GROWLING) Stewart!
Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."

Ever since I was born.

"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?

Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."
Quit the Agency.
Have your drink.
It could have been anybody walk through your door.
Yeah.
But it was you.
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.
Start the count.
"No, please, God."
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why did you do that?

What a shame.

"- The fuck, Emerson?"
No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
"Okay, I'll meet you over there."
You got it.
Come on!
Didn't tell me it was this heavy.
Hey!
"Hey, what the fuck are you guys doin' in here, huh?"
"You got a problem, buddy?"
"Uh, no-no problem."
"No, you ain't got no problem, right?"
That's right.
"Just be cool, motherfucker."
"Yo, Bobby..."
"Yo, yo, come here, man."
Hold this one.
Come on.
"Now, I advise you two to take that beer out the trunk of your car."
"And I advise you, smiley, to put that knife away."
You advise?
That's a pretty big word for a nigger.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, fuck!"
[Grunting]
[Box cracking]
"You okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Well, let's get rid of these turkeys and clean up this mess, huh?"
- Hey.
- Hmm?
Thanks.
You okay?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, how do you feel about goin' to shoot some pool?"
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"

Maybe a robbery.
There's nothing in the room except for a coat...
Got it.

"- You're welcome to bring her, Eli."
"- Okay, I'll ask her."
"Dad, did you read my essay?"
"When you write it, I'll read it."
"Oh, my God, that reminds me."
That money for the pictures was due yesterday.
If you'll give me the form like I keep asking...
"Oh, Rick what is it?"
I've been subpoenaed to appear.
Subpoenaed?
To appear where?
Before a grand jury investigation of the Atlantor project.
[Rick] No.
You're right.
"Walter, this is unbelievable."
Okay.
All right.

"It is burning, Ivan Semenovich!"
Thanks a lot.

And I seem to be ready to marry any stranger.
-Malakhov!
Take it!
"-Yes, sir!"
Go to our positions quickly.
I'll followyou.
I will not lose a drop.
Your security officer captain Shulgin visited me and asked a lot of questions.
It is hisjob.
The war is around.
We are in the front line.
I have to pee really badly.
Hot.

"Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
Did you get breakfast?
"I tried, but I got recognized."
Do I know you from somewhere?
Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
- Oh!
- Jake?
Amy...
It's so good to see you.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
- Also why would we die?
- Can I interrupt for a second?
I just want to say that I love both of you guys.
Trent more than I did before.
OK.
"Well, just so you know, I hate both of you."
Do you want any oil before we start?
No.
"Please, I... that wasn't in the script."
Sounds like we're ready to go.
Let's get started.
Ah.
"Three, two, one."
Hit it!
None of my moves are sexual.
I apologize.
- Wow!
"- Yeah, wow."
That was an amazing story.
"Hey, Danny."
You have to tell us if you got the ring back when you get back from the bathroom.
"Hey, yeah."
OK.
Just give me a few seconds.
- Flashbacks are exhausting.
"- Hell, yeah."
So look.
The stripper scouts turned out that they loved us.
And so did the audience.
So...
Anyway.
"OK, well."
- This is the new efficiency system.
- See you tomorrow.

My father's in a grave...
"Oh, wow, complaining."
"That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you."
"Before I came along, you were on a skateboard."
Oh!
Oh!
You like them?
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, what do you like?"
Everything.
"Well, I don't know."
I don't really listen to music.
"Dude, that's kind of weird."

"I'm sorry, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
Oh yeah?
"Well, what about the Cramps?"
Stiff Little Fingers?

In two weeks?
A year?
Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No.
I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No.
I'm fine here.
Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course.
I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.

Delicious German bratwurst.
We hate bratwurst.
I love bratwurst.
Since when?
I'll get it!
No.
"No, no."
How can we go anywhere?
"- You're not dating her, then."
- I went to her house and...
- That's not dating.
- Have you gotten anywhere yet?
- No.
- I would have dug in the first 20 minutes.
"- Shut up, man."
- Dude.
"- Anyway, she invited me to a skate party Saturday night."

Fucking dick.
Treats her like crap.
Remember that one time when your mom kicked him out of the house?

It is not possible.
He must go home.
But I love it!
I want to marry her.
ll have to live with him 6 months under the same roof.
"It is not possible, since you take him."
That's what I'm saying.
"* Your attention, please ..."
You will not let him go after what he did.
Because it hurts me!
Still.
It happens!

"Eventually, he got bored with the truck, so I took advantage of his window of low-speed driving and gave it my best shot."
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
This is the slowest the stig has ever driven.
Don't let him down.

- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John.
We cannot...
No refusals!
I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!
Let us settle in.
Good night.
I see...
So this is the lowest layer.
"You say the two of them are here, right?"
Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.

Sure I can.
I'll be right back.
"Gingy, Gingy..."
"Run, run, run as fast as you can, if you want to remain a gingerbread man!"
"Oh, Gingy."
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.
"- Oh, well, I..."
- It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty!
Really pretty.
The girl of your dreams.
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!
Gingy!
"Let go, Gingy!"
"Fall with me, so we can be together forever!"
Here's a thought.
You let go!

It's got me by the dangler!
How very inconvenient for you!
"I was so busy trying to keep me fingers out of the way, I forgot about me dangler!"

"- You do, don't you?"
-
"- Anything I can do, Mr Arkwright?"
"Funny you should say that, Jelly...er, Julie."
-
- What are you doing?

It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."

"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
We've got your number.
Hey.
Mother of mercy.
"Yeah, we were just leaving."
I don't blame you.
Who is this guy?
A very colorful dead end.
"Hey, where's Natalie?"
She's downstairs.
"Oh, she's signing autographs."
"You hate this, don't you?"
What?
Natalie getting all the attention.
No.
I'm happy for her.
Sure you are.
It's good for her.
She deserves it.
Long overdue.

I'm not old enough to... remember that event.
but trust me:
the poor and the noble... lose every war since then... regardless of flag...
And women...
Women have no flag.
The real Italian flag does not show three colors... but the male organ.
"Moral, Homor, Family... the cult of religion, are there, in between the legs."
- My God!
- I disagree...
A little exaggerated.
There's only one flag... this one.
But that is from Savoia.
Listen.
American airplane.
I think it is German.
And why the US don't fight back?
The Americans are asleep.
They rise early.
I heard another noise before.
Listen.
There's people at the stairs.
- Let them in.
- Ok.
Easy.
Slow.
Come in.
She was taken by God.
Let's go out.
"Nunziatina, Carmela, stay here."
Bring what's needed.
Quick.
Let's go into the other room.
"Oh, he's a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers."
I shouldn't put up with this.
I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?
"Yes, I'm a real racecar."
What do you think?
Look at me.
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes!
Yes!
I must scream it to the world!
My excitement from the top of someplace very high!
- Do you know many Ferraris?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
Is that what I think it is?
Customers.
Customers!
"Customers, everyone!"
Customers!
- OK!
- Customers?
- I don't know.
It was kind of nice having a roommate.
Sushi?
I hope you have a better plan than that.
It's all about misdirection.
I don't wanna show my hand too early.
"Well, the two of you have had enough misdirection."
"Trust me, show your hand."
"Move your toes, Trina."
Good.
- O-neg's here.
- Put it right on the infuser.
"Trina, do you remember anything?"
They started shooting.
They just started shooting.
Threading the catheter.
Wire back.
- What'd she say?
- Hook me up.
- Ten blade.
"- Trina, how many of them were there?"
"Two, in an SUV."
I saw them drive up.
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.
- Curved Kelly.
- I might have seen them getting away.
Anything more specific?
"It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe."
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height?
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."

No.
That's not it.
It's you.
No.
This is all your doing.
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
they have been a success and has dedicated big praises.
He is expected to call for similar renovations...
at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a %$#@.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.

I have to go.
Hello.
"Hey, it's me."

Tell me about your family.
Well my father was drunk and my mother was drunk.
"They should have never had a fucking kid, you know."
The yakuza is my family now.
It gives up absolute loyalty and trust.
We take care of each other.
We take care of each other.
Sounds all right.
It is.
You will like it.

We bare in public.
Oh I see.
What is the story with those guys anyways?
"Are they- they are very special to each other, yes."
"Uh-huh, like what?"
Are they engaged?
"No, they will never marry."
Why not?
Why not?
Thank you for your candor.

"All right, shut it down."
Wasting our time.
I've been assuming that all Divergents are the same.
But some are much stronger than others.
Assign all non-essential personnel to the Divergent detail.
We need to look harder.
We need to find that very special one.
Not everywhere.
Damn it.
I got nothing.
That's because it's not down here.
Shhh!
"Blair, give me the gun."
No.
Well then give Riley the gun.
My gun.
"Yeah, it's his gun."
"Now look, I'm making an executive decision here."
"We're gonna go after this sick fuck, and we're gonna take him out."
Are you fucking kidding me?
We just saw what he's capable of.
I'm not going after him with one bullet.
Blair.
I found something.
I bet you the jammer's down here.
No.
Ah.

"Ah, that's right."
You're claustrophobic.

Thank you.
So this is Chosun...
So.
"Yes, sir!"
Send out the scouts.
"Yes, sir!"
This is war at last...!
"On April 13, 1592, some seven hundred Japanese warships appeared on the coast of Pusan."
It was the advance guard of Chosun invasion Konishi Yukinaga's fleet.
This was its beginning of the brutal seven-year war between
Chosun and Japan...
Jakbo.
"Yes, Dae-man?"
Isn't that Su-chang from the shipyard?
Yes.
He's trying to get himself killed!
"Hey, Su-chang!"
Are you crazy?
Where did you get that uniform?
Did you steal it?
"I knew you weren't normal when you took a hammer to a warship, but..."
Did he just hit me?
Jakbo.
Yes?
"I'm right, right?"
Yup.
Dae-man!
- Did you hear the news?
- What news?
The high commander made that boy a commander!
"Starting today, Su-chang is a commander!"

"- It's me, Cloudy."
Open the door.
I can't.
"- What do you mean, you can't?"
You all right?
"- Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
- Where's the keys?
- Over there.
Hi there.
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you.
- A mess.
"- Give me my pants, will you?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds.
Mulderig and Klein.
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys,... ..and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap."
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.

It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
Wait a minute.
Dad... what is it?
"That sweater, Zoe."
Whose sweater is that?
It's my friend's.
He lent it to me.
"""He""?"
"Oh, no."
No.
Are you hanging out with boys?
"Zoe, I've had this talk with you before."
All boys are bad.
All of them.
"Yes, Dad, yes."
Seriously?
"I gotta go, okay?"
I love you.
"- I love you, too."
- I love you.
"Bye, bye-bye."
My dad always says never judge a book by its cover.
"Take Pin, for example."
"The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly..."
"Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief, after all."

Pin... what have you done?
Go away

Previously on 24...
"Six months ago, U.S. Special Forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization."
Bin-Khalid's people found us.
Where is it?
"A strongbox that belongs to Sheik Bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him."

"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:
"""Dan."""
Sort of.
- Sort of?
"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
- There is something decadent.
- Only in the entire universe ...
It is cool the actors Simon.
You will have you.
- It's great what he says.
I want the book.
- Leave me.
- She has had?
- Who was I?
- Who you had?
- Tu.
I love you.
"You know, I love you."
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.
The return when I want.
Do not go!
"No, I must follow!"
You need to do evil to survive?
- Even a child?
"- Not a child, it's worse."
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
-No worries.
You never know.
See you.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Looking for an apartment...
There is no housing.
I have no money.
You've got the documents?
No.
"Come on, get out!"
Line!
You do not have to look for here.
How long was it?
-10 Minutes.
-Just.
"In barely 10 minutes later I noticed the ad, intercepted, searched and forced him out of the neighborhood."
"I'm not ga over there look, it's over."
We can go.
-OK.
Here we go.
"Listen, it's not complicated."
"I want 4 grenades, 3 electrical detonators and 5 kg of explosives."
Explosives?
What kind?
-C4.
Got it or not?
I've got everything.
But it will give you 5 pounds?
You want to breathe the air of Paris?
You are right.
Better that nothing not talking.
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.
just a sex object for this man.
And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it here.
- I'll drop it off tomorrow.
- By bus.
I promise.
- With the graveyard shift.
I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.
- We need it.
- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
"Madam, nobody has arrested you."
Now please go home.
"If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police."
"Very well, then."
Where would I get a Mickey Finn?
I haven't the faintest idea.
"There you are, you see?"
"Come, Cedric."
What are you waiting for?
Come along.
"Ethel, come on!"
"Sergeant, where would one get a Mickey Finn?"
"I haven't the faintest idea, sir."
(Creaks)
- Good evening.
- (Gasps)
Must you keep jumping out?
You seem to have jumped in.
What on earth...?
- I...
I got caught in a storm.
- It hasn't been raining.
It was raining where I was.
Cats and dogs.
"- And mud, I see."
"- Yes, I must brush that off."
"By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning."
Really?
Which one?
I mean...
What do you mean?
She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise, you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"""Snow..."
"""Beard..."
"Grace."""
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
"In the woods."""
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
- Forget him.
Ain't nobody watching you but me.
All right ?
Now show me some attitude.
"MissJohnson, we don't have time for this."
Areyou readyto continue ?
- MissJohnson !
- l'm ready.
Whoo !
Yeah !
"That's what I'm talkin'about, baby."
"Look, all due respect, ifyou don't let this girl in, you're crazy."
[ Murmuring ]
"Thankyou, sir."
Thankyou very much.
"MissJohnson, I can't say this on the record yet, but welcome toJuilliard."
[ Laughs ]
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
[ Laughs ]
"Oh, yeah, hype it up."
"Hype it up, everybody."
"Hey, I heard you got intoJuilliard."
"That's like the hottest school on the planet, right ?"
"Yeah, it's pretty good."
"Well, I know they got all these famous dance teachers and shit, but ifyou need some new moves, you know, some real flavor, you know who to call."
All right ?
All right.
- Congratulations !
- Thankyou.
Hold it.
Hold it.
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.
I want two boards and some pitch.
"Hagman, I want a lantern, a pound of gunpowder and a pound of old iron."
"Cooper, go on sentry."
"- And, Perkins..."
- Sir?
Dig a proper grave for Captain Murray.
"Yes, sir."
- Out!
- That box on the horse.
-Yes.
-Look.
- lt should go that way.
"Ivan Semenovich, may I go out for a second?"
-No problem.
- Could you watch the communications as well?
Everything is simple here.
"Look, you simply press this button."
-OK.
- Then this one.
And then the red one.
That's all.
-Do you follow me?
"- Press this button, that one and the red one."
"OK, daughter, go out and do not worry."
"Fedorischev, Karapetyan, all the others - get into the truck!"
-Asya!
"- Grisha, what a look you have!"
-ls it good?
"- No, it isn't."
-Well...
-Did you manage to have some meal?
"Surely, well."
Honestly I do not remember...
"Oh, my dissolute one, let's go, I'll warm something up."
-Aren't you on duty?
- There is a replacement.
Let's go.
"Saidov, stay here."
Sidorenko!
-Why are you silent?
"-Yeah, this hill has to be stormed."
I simply don't know what to do!
Yeah.
You good in the garden?
I think so.
Yes.
Yes.
Have you thought about...
Carrots?
Right!
I'll get that recorded.
Thank you.
How's it been anyway?
What the scenario didn't make you feel welcome?
He can't see the point in me.
There's a dog in the script.
"We don't even employ Jack Russel to write woof woof, do we?"
Just been readin' your work.
Umm...them could be better.
We should get some lunch.
I don't accept charm.
It's official business.
I've a proposal for you.
"When I'm not busy special advising, I work for a man called Gabriel Baker."
Remember him?
The Hungarian.
He's a producer.
Desperate to me.
A film that will make a difference.
"Hello, Tom."
Hello.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
David?
David!
( Screaming )
"Look, lady."
"Officially, this case is closed."
That's understood.
The circumstantial evidence points to an inside job.
"The aunt's a nut, but she's clean."
No one else will buy a nine-year-old doing all this.
Hasn't he ever been checked out psychologically?
"They checked him out at social services, but he passes with a clean bill of health."
"Squeaky clean, beyond suspicion."
I need to see those police reports.
( Sighing )
All right.
You got a fax?
"Uh-huh, at the school."
Okay.
In the morning.
"But before breakfast, because it sure as hell ain't rated ""G."""
( Telephone Ringing )
Wasena.
"Um, I'm-- yes, he is."
Could you hold on?
"Mr. Jenkins, it's for you."
Let me take it here.
Hello.
"- Good morning, Eva."
- 'Morning.
I'm expecting a fax.
Nothing yet.
"Okay, thanks."
"People, please."
We had a total of 76 cards that came out of the deck.
Twenty-three were high cards with a value of minus one.
"Seventeen were neutral with no value at all, and the rest were low cards with a value of plus one."
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.
The count.
It's plus 13.
Yes.
Pull up a chair.
Stop.
- What is it?
- Plus 12.
Eggs.
Twelve eggs in a carton.
- Now what?
- Plus 9.
Cats have nine lives.
Cat.

"Amber, where are you going?"
It don't matter where I'm going.

You think I'm gonna just let you leave with my baby?
It ain't your choice.
I don't need your permission.
- Shit.
- I especially don't need your money.
Can you move?
And you know what?
"I damn sure don't need them damn flowers, so you can send those back to one of your other randoms."
You can't do this.
- And you mention there wasn't an excuse for it?
-Jaelen!
-Please stop it.
Stop it!

"It's a mater of national security, you see?"

Nonsense!
I feel very sorry to the two of you.
"When you see Master Huang, ask him not to be angry with me, please."

Stop it!
Mousy!
The two bounty hunters are dead.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
- Where are they?
- Over there!
Must be masked killer!
The masked killer?
He must be connected with the opera troupe.
You don't have to tell me.
Just let me know if I can be of service.
No thanks.
You're not the Marshal.
I can easily handle this.
I've got all the masked opera singers here!
But who is the murderer?
Shut up!
Speak up!
Okay.
Akan is taking the girl to his building.
Shit.
Let me handle this.

- That fag white hair is dead.
You wanna go on a bike?
You can go on a bike.
Just...
You wanna go?

"The target moves, permission to shoot!"
Permission denied Kix.

Did you hear what I say?
- Yes.
TS ...
"Good job, make the brother."
"- Hey, you."
Should not be in bed.
- I could not sleep.
- Do Yorulmadın?
"- No, just can not sleep."
"OK, so how can you explain a story?"
How is this?
- Up the stairs.
"- Up the stairs, okay."
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
"A long, long time ago ..."
Very distant land ...
But so far ...
There is a little angel sleeping there ...
"I have done for yourself, John."
"Not for me, not for our daughter."
Have you done for yourself.
"Do not lie to yourself, even for a moment."
"- Hi, John."
"- Hey, Rache."
Ah ...
I made lasagna last night.
"Many, many more remained in my hand."
"If you open up, can I bring some of that."
Nice color scheme.
"Here,s another cabinet."
"No, it,s a bidet!"
How practical!
It really is.
"I,II just sit down."
- Not too sturdy.
- Sure it is.
This is great!
Did you see the tub?
Look!
Straight out of hollywood.
"It,s comfortable, with handles and everything."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, please get cleaned up and meet us in the living room."
What kind of decor do you prefer?
I Iike antiques.
"I Iike natural, ecological materials."
"AII we,ve got is modern."
"Here,s one possible layout for the living room."
Do we have to follow it?
"No, do what you Iike."
- Can we keep it?
"It,II give us ideas."
- Sure.
"Ladies and gents, our table"
Now take a peek
And the chairs of plastic
Green is so chic
"Isn,t our hi-fi cool?"
And the TV?
Where does it go?
What could that be?
"Yeah, sure."
"You cry, and it's all my fault."
I'm not crying.
You don't even want me to live here.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"
"Besides, it's starting to melt."
"- So, it's that urgent?"
- I already told you that.
What if Lella is delayed?
It would be a disaster.
Then let me handle this before it's too late.
Mother of God!
Actually...
I'm going to devour you!
- Just a moment...
let me get undressed.
- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?
That's not actually my line.
Mr. Monk said it first!
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
- Yeah.
- Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my god."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
- Really do have to.
- Sure.
- We should... we should head up.
"- Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
- Captain's probably.
- Mr. Monk.
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name's on them.
I'm not gonna Deny that.
- Did you bother reading them?
"- Yes, sir, I have."
Then you know I didn't threaten anybody.
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioner some constructive criticism.
I know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Yeah.
Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my God."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
We really do have to...
"Oh, sure."
We should head up.
"Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
The Captain probably...
Mr. Monk?
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
Did I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name is on them.
I'm not going to deny that.
Did you bother reading them?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Well, then, you know I didn't threaten anybody."
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioners some constructive criticism.
I don't know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
"I'm sure you do, Mr. O'Dwyer."
What am I gonna do with you?
You need to warn His Holiness.
Casey!
Henry?
"Sweetie, what is it?"
"Angela, is there something you need to tell me?"
I'm sorry.
I've been very selfish lately.
"I haven't really let you in, have I?"
"Henry, if you won't talk to me, if you won't tell me what's troubling you, how am I supposed...?"
You need to confess.

Hello?
St. Anthony.
He was the patron saint of...
Uh...
lost things.
I thought that was St. Jude.
"No, St. Jude is lost causes."
So how can you tell when something stops being lost and starts being a lost cause?
We're going to find Casey.
People don't just disappear.
Well...
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
She was disappearing... before she was ever lost.
Henry's illness...
You've spent too long with lesser species.
The trash out on the housing estates.
"The dole scum, the layabouts."
Werewolves.
Come with me.
"- No, I'm actually tired."
I'm really...
"- Oh, hush now."
It's time for you to claim your heritage.
As a vampire and as a man.
"Now, who do we have in here?"
"Everybody, this is our boy..."
Adam.
These will be your kind of people now.
Melvyn there is a dentist.
Simon.
And... oh.
You're Sue?
"Hi, Sue."
They work in local government.
"And, er... oh, Tina and Liam run a garden centre."
"- There, see?"
Shall we go upstairs?
"- Please, yeah."
Mm-hm.
This way.
Hello?
It sounds like a party.
"Oh, well, maybe we should come back tomorrow."
"I mean, throwing him a party's not exactly mistreatment."
"Yeah, a vampire party."
Who knows what that involves?
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
Yes.
"Hey, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?"
Here you go.
Would you like to hear
"Excuse me, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?"
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?
- Okay.
"- Thank you very much, sir."
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?
Have a great day.
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?
But what made him come back?
Won't you answer?
Nathan?
... right turn.
It doesn't recover.
We're dropping the...
"Speed, 220 knots."
Wings lowered.
Flap up.
Flap up!
Flap up!
Power!
Power!
"Oh, shit!"
No!
"Of the 45 passengers on board, nine belonged to the same family."
All from Haiti.
So?
So they're afraid of getting fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.
"I explained to them that doesn't exist here, but they're scared, even still."
They set up a committee.
This is leading by example?
"It's not for us, stupido."
It's for the clients.
They're allowed to have pudding on their spa day.
It's like a -- a last hurrah before the real work starts.
[ Sighs ]
Get to work.
"Hey, Frank."
Frank:
Yeah?
We need to order more asparagus.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
Mm.
What do you know?
"Looks like it's my ""spa day,"" too."
[ Chuckles lightly ]
[ Tranquil music plays ]
Sam:
"Okay, good job, guys."
"Go to, uh..."
Downward dog.
[ Grunts ] Hold for five minutes.
[ Exhales sharply ] Five minutes?
It's usually 30 seconds.
Right.
"Yeah, 30 seconds."
That's what -- that's what I mean.
"Okay, uh, I'll just come around, make sure everybody's form is okay, make sure you're, uh, keeping your cores tight, and, uh, your --"
"uh, good job."
Great.
Straighten that back out.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"- Open up the back for me, please."
- Sure.
All right.
"Heel, bud."
[Dog Whines]
[Dog Sniffing]
Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Yeah.
- Have a good night.
- You too.
"Come on, buddy."
[Shouting In Spanish]
Keep an eye in front and behind you.
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Off the road!
Take a knee!
- [Spanish Continues]
- Keep your weapons facedown.
[Gunfire In Distance]
We're SEALs.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
If you had taught him how to load that thing... there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge.
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."
Sure.
Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
"""Gals""?"
"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
Previously on Fringe:
- There is more than one of everything.
OLIVIA:
Who the hell is this guy?
BROYLES:
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
"Yes, my lord."
She is quite important to me.
Too important.
- Master...
- Silence.
I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.
Jacoub!
Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"If you become Tahir's woman, it will make you safe."
And you also.
I promise.
You cannot save everyone.
That's what Bakri said.
"But saving even one person, surely, would be something."
boss?
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.
Get the hell out of here.
boss?
- Fuck off.
Go!
You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
Better than you posing as a Japanese!
"Damn Robin, I quit."
Gosh...
Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!
"If we can't find it, I'm done."
Why would he fight back for that bit of money?
"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.
Sawadee Club
"Mr. Lin, this way please."
Enjoy your dinner here.
All these for the two of us?
All your brother's favourites.
"David, simple meals will do next time."
Don't waste food.
Yes.
Hi!
Lincoln.
Remember me?
This is Roger and Mr. Law.
Hi!
We met before.
Your brother introduced us last time.
I must have been drunk and left early.
Pity your brother has passed away.
We missed him.
Our condolences.
Thank you!
We're having boating party next week.
You brother will never miss it.
You must join us.
"Let's have fun, okay?"
I'll check my schedule and see.
Alright.
See you.
"I'll see you out, Mr. Law."
Why bother?
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""
"That's laughable, isn't it?"
(chuckles)
Take care.

We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.

Your eyes are the color of this bay!
"Man, you're weird."
They are!

Then who was the man in the trunk?
"Oh, Mumsie, what have you done?"
What have I done?

You have murdered an innocent bystander.
Control yourself.
- Get this back to the barge.
- Why?
"If he misses it, he'll be suspicious."
"Besides, it pointless our taking it while he's alive."

I was getting rid of my daughter.
Getting rid of people seems to be a hobby of yours.

Come.

Yes.
"Yes, that's me."

"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
You have to think about the political aspect.

That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...

-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.

But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.

Yes or no?
God willing means god willing.
"No Zaer,"
- It's not my answer.
- Definitely yes or definitely not.
"- I said ""God willing""."
"- I said ""definite answer""."
"You are repeatedly saying ""definitely""."
"If you want a definite answer, its been ""No""_"
"So why would you say ""God willing""?"
"Just say no, at first_"

"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."

"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.
Remorse.
Nice candy.
"'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones."
"Oh, God!"
Three big
- Three years?
Three hundred dollars.
What?
For the windshield.
"Plus, there's this little baby right here."
"You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts."
- This-
- This is a ticket.
- Yeah.
For operating a class-two vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.
Can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion.
- We're talking.
- There's nothin' on it.
My pen ran out of ink.
"Officer, i really must insist."
"From doing paperwork all night, between you and saving your boss."
- My boss?
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
A jam in Los Angeles.
-Let me...
-No hydraulic fluid
-for the platform lifts.
-This is ridiculous.
You guys are making me laugh.
You call yourself truck operators.
"-What's your dram, hydraulic fluid?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, what are you driving, diesels?"
-That's right.
"Well, you simply drain the lube fluid out of the hitch gearbox, transfer it to the hydraulic lifts."
Look alive!
Stop jamming up the works out here!
-Get going!
-(phone ringing)
"-BILKO: $10,000 a year?"
"-Oh, $10,000."
That's nothing.
That's just the beginning.
You're worth a fortune to me.
"-Hello, hello!"
-I'm calling about the Dawson figures.
-What?
!
-Dawson figures-- I have to have 'em right away.
I got to get downstairs and sign some papers.
"-(overlapping chatter, phones ringing)"
-Go to it!
The Dawson figures.
What about the Dawson figures?
-(phone ringing)
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- Milan is amazing.
It'll change our lives.
Who is it?
It's Mario.
Guess where we are?
What?
I'll call you this evening.
Problems at work?
"Optimism, Silvia!"
- Yuck!
- Darn it!
- WELCOME TO THE SOUTH -
You can't do anything?
I've been working there for 15 years!
You promised!
You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.
Shoes!
"Naples: gunfire downtown,"
Minister Maroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the year began, 1,300 in the last ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transfer to Milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Liz:
The drug will take her soon.
Narcan.
Heroin antidote.
All the agents looking for you have it.
"[Gasps, coughing]"
"Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?"
I took him to protect him.
"Yeah, well, now I'm taking you."
[Police radio chatter]
[Handcuffs click]
James:
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
- Mumsie!
- I have it all worked out.
- I've recced his barge.
- Wrecked his barge?
!
"No, Reconnoitred."
He lives on a barge.
"- But, Mumsie..."
- Shh!
Hello?
Are you that Dennis creature?
This is Flora Ransom here.
I have your money.
Come and collect it at 7:30 tomorrow night.
"Now, you get the pills, I'll prepare the trunk."
"""Solder wire to hole marked Z."""
And that's that.
- Wonderful.
- Whatever's that?
"That, my friend, is the bomb completed."
Now for the gunpowder.
Get out my Indian army colonel with the overdraft clothes.
(Doorbell)
Mr MacGregor?
My name is Lord Mayley.
- Yes?
- We haven't met before but you're said to be a very decent sort.
- You're very kind.
- I'm sure you agree that we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
10!
10!
- 10 cardboards!
- Wonderful!
- Ugye?
- Great!
It was worthy.
"We struggled for him, but was worthy."
Where is the kind Tót?
He was it here yet before.
- Lajos.
- Daddy!
Do not sleep eternally.
#Girls!
Respectthe lad well.#
"I am glad that you have a so good mood, my dear Tót."
"I do not know it, how I shall express my gratitude."
"- Come on, major lord."
"- But yeah, yeah."
- I'm happy and satisfied.
- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?
!
Na!
Mariska!
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.
"Oh, Mother, thank you."
Thank you very much.
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.
"2676J, please."
"Hey, watch where you're going there, buddy, will you?"
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.
- I want it.
- You don't need any.
I want some!
"- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?"
"- No, thank you."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Betty and Rodney.
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!
"Master Fan, I've a secret to tell you!"
What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!
I'm here!
What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!
Do you remember a year ago
At the pharmacy?
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
"""Let me get intoxicated."""
"""I am young."""
"""Show me the magic."""
What are you thinking?
"You know, Gul."
Jaipur will be lonely without you.
And you?
I have become lonely.
It's very late.
I have to go home now.
Can't you cancel it?
What?
Going home?
Mumbai.
"- No way, Karan."
Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
"""With hasty regards, Tadao. """
"Grandma, it's a very good idea!"
"You should go, absolutely."
- Everybody to Hawaii!
- Wonderful!
- It will be a great holiday!
"- Grandma, let's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie. """
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from Clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
AKAN:
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia, and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.
Estelle.
Would you please be so kind and stand up?
(GRUNTS)
HENRY: (WHISPERS) No.
Or do you want to take her place?
"Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight, sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick"
(SPITS) to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Brilliant!
Uh...
"Come over here, Henry."
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Henry."
(sesame)

"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn't. (GUNSHOTS)
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Mukesh.
Come here.
I don't care what people will think of me...
But you will never be able to face anyone again!
Put the knife in me!
What?
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!
Sarika!
I'll break open the door!
He will kill both of us!
Good!
We will die together like star-crossed lovers!
I am warning you for the last time Sarika!
That felt good.
First class first!
It was never Johnny who betrayed me...
It has always been you.
"And today, you want to get away again."
Not this time!
This is Mukesh.
is Johnny there?
"Who, Karpov?"
Yes.
He took off.
To Mauritius.
The lucky fucker ran into a bag of cash!
Johnny!
"Brother, we have reached."
Where are you?
We have been waiting outside the train station.
Are you coming?
"Seventeen black, we won!"
Great!
"Fortunate in games of chance, unfortunate in games of love."
we won.
"What, thats all?"
yes.
Ok then
Thanks

You where splendid.
"Truly, you looked marvelous."
"Enough with the complements, you know that there is no room for them between us."
What time is the meeting?
Tonight at midnight.
And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.
Me?
Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"
wait.
What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?
"I do not know, It was dark."
And who was she?
"Don't know, I only saw her shadow."
"Oh, sure."
"Ah,I see, there goes your ""ghost."""
Why?

Sorry.
Welcome.
"Please press the button to select your room, then receive your key at the front desk."
Resting or staying overnight?
Overnight.
"Overnight is 14,000 yen, plus day fee of 5,800 yen."
Really?
That's the rule.
So expensive.
200 yen is your change.
"The girl's no good, she's not sexy and she's loose down there."
"Seriously, and she mentioned her dad is a cop, too."
Don't tell me you fell for her sob stories.
Where are you?
The bathroom.
Bet she's already stolen your stuff and left.
What?
First time?
Never done this?
Not for this reason.
No one here.
"Oh, an employee."
"""What are you doing here?"""
Not throwing it?
"Well, I just bought this phone."
Tired?
Hey there.
There is some problem.
Where are you going?
To have a smoke.
Pia.
"- Yes, sir."
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.
Where is Adi?
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.
"If she is not talented, sack her."
Throw her out.
You know we are short of time.
It is better you do this job.
Where did the husband spring from?
He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!
He's left on a pilgrimage.
That's wonderful!
A thorn out of my path!
But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!
Haribhai?
I'm in a hurry...
See you later.
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!
Who's throwing the litter around?
That's no litter...
Siraj!
What are you doing here?
And what's this?
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.
This set-up is my own.
Have you bought it then?
What's that?
A Hindu name?
"$10 million for exclusive distribution of island white,"
- ...in cash.
- $12 million.
- $15 million.
- $17.5 million.
I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."
- What?
Where?
- Here...
"Here, and..."
"Oh, my God."
- That's Amanda Kane.
- What has Finch done to her?
Looks like he's turned her into a human Guinea pig.
- I'm going in there.
- I'm riding shotgun.
I'll be your eyes and ears.
Meet your first and only customer.
- Who is she?
- She's nobody.
- She have a name?
- None she remembers.
Your narcotic's impressive.
Just keep looking.
Let him go.
Husband...!
Who are you and what do you want?
"I'm a local salt cooker named Pan-dong, sir."
And?
I came to give you an important information.
Could I possibly get my tax reduced in return?
What?
Is this a joke?
!
"No, no!"
You'll have a big problem in your hands unless something is done!
A big problem?
"Sir, are you all right?"
Thanks.
Be careful.
Arrest this man!
What is the meaning of this!
Let go!
We know what you've been going around doing.
I have done nothing wrong!
We'll find out once we get to the government canter.
Take him away!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Chun-su!
Something terrible has happened!
They arrested Soon-shin!
Pardon?
They might hurt him if we don't do something!
It's all right.
He's a noble.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?
honey.
you know I will.
Hey.
what's up?
- How's it going? but it's tomorrow.
set it up.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in between your little palettes there?
all right then.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.
- What is it?
- l need some time off.
nothing like that.
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.
good.
Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.
"Your ""Would be"" bride shall be with us."
"Give me my brother and take away your ""Would be"" bride."
- Come on!
- Away!
Away!
"If something happens to my brother, everyone shall be killed."
"Brother, the girl!"
Sit in the car!
You'll attack us?
Get up!
Get up!
Don't beat!
Shadab!
What?
It's no good.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And don't get artistic.
Just peel the bloomin' thing.
Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
What are you...?
Nothing.
Oh
"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."
You don't have to make stuff up...
- Can't we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...
Well...
Do you... have to... do anything special?
when you go steady...?
No.
-So everything's the same?
- Yeah...
Okay.
- We can go steady.
- Really?
Yes.

I hope you been learning how to swim...
Coz today you're goin' in... go
You must be quick.
"Faster, faster!"
What you think you're gonna do with that...?
I'm gonna... hit you with it...
If you try anything...
Really?
"Alex, what are you doing here?"
So nice to see you!
"I was dropping off some contact sheets and I figured I'd stop by... and say ""hi""."
How are you doing?
Holding up?
Barely.
I just about to transfer... the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- I can sneak out of here for... five minutes before I have to get back to this closet.
- Cool.
- Let me just get my coat.
"Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work late."
Hang in there!
Paul.
"John, Simmon, How sweetie!"
Hello there!
- How art thou?
"- Good, what about the Yuri?"
- Brutal!
- Brutal...
I can't even think about it before breakfast.
"- Jocelyn, you missed it!"
- What?
Raw brilliance!
Helmets...
- helmets.
- Helmut Lang?
Safety is chic.
Living is chic.
Helmut Lang.
"Helmets... for motorcycles, mopeds, vespas and scooters, even."
Why can't they see that?
Those fools!
It's me.
What!
?
I'll be right there.
"Chief, the medical team reports that Miya Shikitani has regained consciousness."
She's conscious...?
Dan...
Gai...
Oh...
Is it that time already?
Shall we go?
You haven't changed at all.
"I was just about your age, too."
How strange...
"For the past 17 years, you and I have lived together as one..."
From that day I first met you...
All this time...
Who... are you?
Protect it...
What is this?
Dangaioh.
Dangaioh...?
- You're almost there.
"Yeah, you got that."
Areyousure it's okay that we came here ?
"Well, it is now, but ifwe're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to fiind someplace else to practice."
Did you always want to be a doctor ?
Who said I wanna be a doctor ?
Chenille.
Everybody.
No.
You're not wearing pantyhose.
It's hot.
Take them off.
No.
Ridiculous.
I'm so sorry.
"Oh, my god."
Where have you been?
"We just wanted to make sure everything was set up, you know, perfectly at the reception and the dinner, and it's great."
Wow.
You look amazing.
You look like a princess.
What's wrong?
Don't cry.
"It's just, I've dreamed about this day my whole life."
Since my first communion.
Is that weird?
"No, hon."
We've all been dreaming about our own weddings.
Now that I'm here this doesn't feel right.
Everything will work out as it... should.
The future kind of has a funny way of doing that.
You just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.
Deep breath.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Hey.
Wait.
Picture.
No.
No pictures.
He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you!
Dirty Arabs?
Reminds me of waterboarding.
You got a bathtub in here?
Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank.
"Forget the bank, I want the banker!"
"Apart from banking, what does the banker do?"
Walk his dachshund through the park?
Rare?
Medium?
Well done?
Overdone?
The theater.
He took a shine to some piss pot actress.
Care to impart her pseudonym?
Aglaé.
Gla Gla!
That tip would have saved your hide.
"Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary."
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing!
Why do I make a show of it?
Because... you're my friend.
"You know what I feel, right now, here?"
I'll tell you.
I'm gonna barf.
What am I good for?
Nothing gives.
Makes a void inside.
You got religion?
No!
Here.
- That's good.
That's not what I said though.
- What do you mean?
- When you were... born.
When I was born?
You mean changing diapers and things?
- I did that.
- I know you did.
"Remember, once I went out into the road... and you waited, and you gave me a spanking... for going out in the road?"
- Do you remember?
"- Oh, I remember that one too."
That was a tough -
- And you -
- That was a tough corner.
And you used to take me fishing?
Right?
"Oh, I did."
Every week.
Every week we went fishing and horseback riding.
Remember?
- Do you -
"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.
I'm still livin'.
Yes.
And I'm glad you are.
"- I'm not bad, eh?"
- I think you're great.
You still look pretty handsome to me.
[Chuckles]
- I'm not bad.
That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
You're here.
And so are you.
"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.

"Yes, please."
"It won't take long, just a minute."
Doctor Tarras?
I don't know if you remember some days ago you put me a tooth cap.
And... it's moving.
I'm sorry.
Didn't know it was that late.
"Alright, at the clinic."
I'm sorry for waking you up.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Federico?
It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
"Oh, Rache ..."
Why did I bother?
That does not bother to.
"We both miss him, John."
- I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
- Okay.
OK.
"- Hey, thanks for your looking for."
- No problem.
I never listened to?

You will understand what the hell is?
Shall I wear something on me.
Then they go to Sam to figure out.
"Tell your father, the latter one."
"After that, the file will not be another, right?"
"Losing it, Rook."
What do you mean?
Do not count on this halledebileceğime?

"Yes, I know."

"Are you all right, Sharon?"
- Now?
- Yeah.
"Aw, God almighty."
"Jesus, Sharon."
"You'll soon be the same shape as me, what?"
Thanks very much.
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine

We should have met him at the airport.
Not at all.
Then you'll know just what to do

You still want me
"Well, tie a yellow ribbon"

It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
Still want me

"Craig, love."
Sharon's having a baby.
Is that right?
"That's right, yeah."
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
"Had you given the money, you would've saved a life."
"Trying to be a hero, are you?"
Go to hell!
"You moron, I'll kill you!"
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
"So, I took the jewels to save her."
But everything went wrong.
Someone has entered valid launch codes.
Captain on deck!
What the hell is going on?
All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
This can't be right.
"Sir, we have nuclear missiles spinning up on the Albuquerque."
"If our allies see us launching a full scale nuclear strike, they will respond."
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill..
unless you level the White House.
Four minutes to target!
I need a final gonna go for payload delivery.
God forgive me.
Go.
Go!

What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."

What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
[Laughs]
[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
"-We have to evolve, Bill."
Progressing ...
"Out of nowhere, took millions years to get here."
"Watch and learn, little brother!"
I will use natural selection.
"No, no, no."
The taste is very aromatic.
"You bit his ass, do not let go his head."
Instead I'll climb on his head.
-It is now!
"Forward-up, my friend."
"New delights, await us."
"Penguin, are you?"
Penguin.
Bravely go where was never a krill.
"We become legend, Bill."
That something important!
How much longer?
It's close.
"Hey, you idiot!"
Are you the licks kelp!
I guess I was wrong I thought you were ... a cruel machine to kill.
Want to try a penguin?
"Back, Bill."
The animal will pick up!
He's a warrior!
"But soon, he will fall, he is seeing death in the face."
"Good morning, handsome."
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.
-Boys.
-Father worked.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise your arms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise your arms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we never forget to smile.
A big round of applause.
Are you taking care of yourself?
Are you eating properly?
"Yeah, yeah."
I don't believe you.
Your voice tells me otherwise.
"Oh, stop!"
You're not my mother.
I am also not your girlfriend anymore.
But I am your agent.
This is about ourclients and a lost photojournalist.
Oursoldier is the greatest...
He's the bravest!
What the fuck is your hurry?
Sweetie you're digging yourself into deepershit.
The cops will find you here.
"What's up, girl?"
Are you bringing yourboys here now?
You disappeared again.
"Why, did we have a fuck date?"
Fuck you.
I won't have to weara uniform anymore.
How did you get out of it?
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.
She's also dating an astronaut.
Wow.
That's very impressive.
Yeah.
"But Leonard's impressive, too."
Thank you.
"""Befuddled."""
"The word I was looking for was ""befuddled."""
Knight to old woman... six-and-a-third.
Brilliant move.
Thank you.
Will the two of you excuse me?
I need a hug.
"Sorry, I have company."
"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
I don't want to hug you.
"I don't want to hug you, either."
I was just feeling blue.
"Blue, as in depressed."
"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
I don't know what color lonely is.
- What?
- Red is angry;
yellow is frightened;
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.
All right.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!
"- I know you are, Dale."
- I am.
"Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!"
"- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?"
"- You know we are, dude."
- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.
But what can you do?
"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
Done.
What?
Let me do that.
Allright
You're helping out here?
No gentlemen around?
"No, there aren't any."
"Well then, another beer."
Cheers!
Who is Cilly sitting with?
Maybe some truckdriver.
She's into that type.
That's Biberkopf.
I've known him for a while.
Just released from prison. 4 years.
Why?
"Ida, his wife."
He killed her during a binge.
Not too bad.
"Done eating and drinking, she wanders off."
What's he doing here?
Do I owe you something?
You'd better not bother me.
You were in Tegel!
"- Yes, but that's over."
- You're a tough guy.
I'll start my own business:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders"
You're not gonna earn anything with that.
The main thing is that one lives his life decently.
Isn't that right or am i correct?
- What's your name?
See.
He's back to save his brother.
A little longer and... his brother would've been crippled like his father.
Speak up.
What's your answer?
He abused you father.
Satyakant.
Better teach your son... before teaching Dharam kunj.
Start teaching about right and wrong at home.
Look.
Look how cruelly he's been beaten up.
Only a thug or goon can beat someone like this.
You seem to know a lot about goons.
What do you want to say?
Am I a goon?
Your son's action justifies that.
Surya!
Forth first time...
I hit someone.
That too my son.
You will never hit anyone again.
I... apologise...
On behalf of my son.
Let's go!
This boy has humiliated Satyakant's honor.
I'll handle him.
Satyakant!
Satyakant!
Brother.
Shiv.
He abused father.
I can endure anything in life.
There's no one there.
We can watch hockey.
Doesn't matter
--I am leaving you all --Where to?
Where to?
To take Sorokin's place?
Just my own
Where once was a feast There now stands a coffin...
What?
"--An aimless coffin --Sorry, which coffin?"
No.
"Hold it, Bobylev!"
Anyutin Lane!
I can't pay them all back.
But I will return one small debt.
Stop.
Make a left
--There's a ditch there.
Take pity on the vehicle.
"--I said, go left!"
"Faster, faster."
Why are you crawling?
--Now what?
--A puddle.
Need to check its depth.
Give me the steering wheel!
Step on it.
We'll cross it by accelerating
"I tell you like an ex-tank driver, step on it hard."
There we are.
I didn't get a chance to buy insurance on it.
"Oh, Bobylev."
Sorry.
Change of plans.
We'll take it from here.
[âª]
(syd:) thanks.
Got a knife?
His contact probably has the key to that.
"(andreas:) no, I do."

I don't think anyone followed us.

Like where you get your information.
Oh my god.

"(syd:)you're the answer man, watson."
I don't know.
You don't know?
This wasn't in my information.
Did you dial the numbers correctly?
Yes.
I don't suppose you have the number
For a bomb disposal unit?
Alright.
We can't just leave the map here.
A man who worked for
My father's construction company
Showed me how to do this once.
Defuse a bomb?
You got it?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Slowly.
Everything like I told you.
"Get out, and open my door, now."
Out.
"Andy, he's inside."
We ain't letting you out of here till you give us something.
"Hey, Paul."
What you got?
"Vagrancy and, uh, resisting arrest."
That's not a good way to start the day.
Come on.
Do I get my phone call?
What's going on?
Vernon.
"That domestic you rolled last week, the one with the broken collarbone?"
- What about him?
- Ia is all over it.
They want a statement from you on tape.
After we process this guy.
Bates can take care of it.
"I want this cleared up now, in my office."
Let's go.
Are you deaf?
Come on.
You watch yourselves with this one.
Process him then get back here.
"Okay, feeding in the loops."
Move.
Open it.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Send backup.
- All units respond.
Hold it steady.
My God!
"Yep, it's definitely a rug!"
"Way to go, Hardy, you asshole!"
"Tommy, congratulations."
We're all very proud of you.
You blew up a litter bug's car and found a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.
Let's just say that it was the killer and it was a cop.
It'd be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns.
He'd just be waiting for us to come along.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- Hardy...
- Yes.
- You should know something...
- Are you really a man?
- No.
- Good.
But I was married to one.
- A cop?
- Worse.
A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter.
She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
Hello.
-Hi.
Dude!
Thomas!
How's he doing?
Not so bad.
"There cerebral hematoma, but should to withdraw."
-Will there be consequences?
I had no idea.
I'm not a doctor.
They closed squat.
I know.
"If you want, come in Montrouge."
There are places.
Thank you.
"Here we are, do not worry."
We will avenge you.
Is Pierre here?
"I know 's early, but I see it."
Pierre does not work here.
Yeah?
I'll give you his new address.
I guess he not sit with what detention.
We all have our limits.
"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
But I beat them black and blue.
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh.
I can make arose stink.
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give lice to a bald head.
Listen.
You can't even lie properly.
- Shiv the truth is...
- Kamini!
He's no brave officer.
Kamini!
- He's a coward cop.
- Kamini.
- What?
- Kamini.
Kamini.
Calm down.
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.
You're not worthy of being my husband.
I say you're not worthy of this uniform either.
Inspector!
What did she hurl at me witch.
Nephew.
It's like this.
I'm actually a sub-inspector.
I couldn't become an inspector.
You see.
I had been appointed for the security... of that crazy ACP Ayushman Thakur's sister.
Now how do I go with this broken hand?
You don't get it.
See.
What are you doing?
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
"Before they killed them, they tortured them."
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
"I didn't know, I didn't know..."
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
- Shooting.
Wait!
Wait.
She's pregnant.
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140.
Baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
"It's my arm, man."
It hurts like a...
Do something already!
BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
"Ricky, you need to calm down."
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
"Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis."
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
"So, what?"
Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
"- An eye for an eye, man."
- Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
Oh...
Out of time.
You found two answers...
And what you are looking for was transformer.
"This is the stuff you know, guys, isn't it?"
"Difficult to find in the hive, though."
Not particularly.
Not that kind of physics.
Not electronics.
"Well, not bad then, in that case."
"You got two points, well done."
"Team Araucarians, over to you."
Which topic would you like?
We have left...
We're good on...
"Music's not good for any of us, is it?"
No.
"Well, maybe me."
I work in technology.
"Technology, yeah."
Go for it.
Technology.
You've chosen technology.
You're looking for typefaces.
You've ten seconds to confer.
Typefaces?
"Helvetica, Comic Sans, Garamond, Arial, Times New Roman..."
Helvetica - we've had that.
Yeah.
Courier...
Time's up.
"Simon, at the far end, we're going to start with you."
Maybe later.
"What do we got, McGee?"
"How about you, Agent Gibbs?"
When was the last time you made a good snow angel?
'Cause it's... it's snowing.
McGee.
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.
They pick up chatter all the time.
Subject is northeast U.S. airports.
"Attention, passengers-- due to extreme weather conditions..."
Oop.
Sorry.
Uh...
"Oh, hey."
You again.
"Look, about before, uh, my husband has quite the chivalrous streak."
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, now that I've run into you again... do we know each other?"
I feel like we've met before.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Has that ever happened to you?
"You see a face, you just can't place it?"
"Not really, no."
Oh.
"Delays are a drag, huh?"
Where you headed?
Home to see family?
Paris.
Business.
"Ah, Paris."
Timetable updated.
-Mmm-hmm.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
is there a problem?
-No.
"-Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
"Ugh, this drilling is driving me nuts."
I wanna find David and Meredith.
(tapping THE GUN)
You sure no one else could be in here?
-What?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
-Think they got what they came for?
-Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
katherine:
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
Make him flee?
Mr. Thakur wants to become the CP.
Tomorrow if people find out that... one of his inmates has escaped... then you can flush his chances of a promotion... down the drain.
Good.
What's on your mind?
Clear all the charges against Shiv... and set him free.
Once his connection's severed from you...
I'll cut his connection with life permanently.
Wow!
What an idea!
Great.
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.
Fine.
I'll give Shiv clean chit and release him.
Good.
But don't mess up the contract.
He won't.
How can he?
When he kills Shiv I'll be with him.
Right Boss.
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Get out.
Go on.
Let's go.
Who are you?
Boss.
Dad our player's entered the field.
Yes.
Wow!
- [ Grunts ]
"Help, Smithers."
I'm sinking.
I'm sinking.
[ Gasps ]
Life... flashing... before-- [ Gurgling ] eyes.
You're fired!
Dance!
[ Laughing ]
[ Grunting ]
Dance!
[ Horn Blows ]
All right.
We're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste.
"Oh, no!"
Our boat is sinking.
"It was I, you fools!"
The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all. [ Grunts ]
"And all this time, I've been smoking harmless tobacco."
"[ Chortles, Grunts ]"
[ Evil Laughter]
"I got a mink chamois, sir."
I hope that-- [ Gasps ]
"Oh, my God!"
Mr. Burns is dead!
[ Sobbing ] Why do the good always die so young?
[ Wailing ]
[ Gasps ] You almost killed me!
"- [ Grunts ] - [ Gasps ] Please, sir."
You'll catch-- [ Gags ] cold.
"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died... there would be no one to carry on my legacy?"
Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm...
Everyone report to the parachute issuing room in half an hour!
Sirl
What's that?
Oh.
One of the girls wrote it.
"""..."
Let no parachute sidle or slump...
"""For today we go warring together,"
"""And my soul..."
"""...will be there at the jump."""
It's rather good?
"I wouldn't know, poetry is not in my line."
Why do you always have?
Stop talking there!
Right.
"Out on the tarmac, you men."
Move yourselves.
Let's begin.
Deck 'shun!
Quick march!
"Company, halt!"
"All right, fall out."
I'm sorry for the man who hears the pipes and who isn't born in Scotland.
Standby to enplane.
Enplane.
"Climb aboard, boys."
Good luck to you.
I'll see you back at the camp in the morning.
"I hope so, Sir."
"Listen, everybody."
This is Flight Sergeant Box.
He's our radar dismantling expert.
"Shut, fucking you, right!"
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
"Congratulations, dude."
6 months.
And I am to start in September.
And...?
"The fucking practice,"
"All do I ... shippings, all the high power plants,..."
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!
"Look, look, look!"
"You're right, I shall discuss with them."
"What's up, guys!"
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
"What's up, bro?"
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
"How about a drop of the white stuff, tickle soft?"
"Paul first, doen't he?"
I should not...
"- Almost for Paul, man."
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you...
"Actually, all of you..."
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Actually, I came here to talk to you."
Me?
-Busy after school?
-Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And bring your flower.
We can't be in detention together.
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
-I'm gonna kill him.
"-No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"- Sarge, I have to pee now too."
- Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
- I have to pee really badly.
- Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge--
"- Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
- Did you get breakfast?
"- I tried, but I got recognized."
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"- Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
- Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
- I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
- I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
SvenPense!
"He saw his eyes, all terrified."
You said he was.
I chose to save that poor life.
What?
"-He will tell their friends, spread terror."
There's a new predator in the area.
-You're crazy!
-Someone needs to control the number of individuals of species.
-I deserve.
Wearethechampions My friends
And we'll keep fighting until the end
If -sees!
-I am the champion!
-Am champion!
It's a musical delight.
Will is the first sign of madness.
We champion
-How is the shoulder?
-Okay.
Boot a little ice it improves.
Thank you.
"No, I thank you."
"Thank you, friend."
"Brian, the king of the beach, will have another season."
That made you a friend of elephant seals.
"As we speak, children?"
"Thank you, buddy to bring Daddy back."
"-I owe you, my friend."
"-Health, Brian."
"No, I mean it."
You only need to ask.
It beat colouring books.
"Don't worry, she has a fabulous memory"
For things she did as a child.
"Actually, he taught me how to"
"Wire a charge, never defuse it."
"But it should work the same in reverse,"
Don't you think?
"Okay, step back."
There's enough c4 in there
To blow the roof of the building off.
"Okay, you've got to isolate your wires."
"Blue, red, yellow,"
White and black.
Black's your power source.
"Of course, it could also be red."
(nigel:)it's blue.
"In every action movie,"
The hero always cuts the blue wire.
You want to risk our lives
On information you got from the movies?
20 seconds...
19...
"White's always the ground,"
So...
"Red is your backup battery, right."
But I only see one battery.
"12 seconds, syd."
Must be black.
(nigel:) ah... (syd:) black.
Ah...
Red.
Ah!
Little?
Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!
November.
"Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you."
Hey.
I'm Barry.
Sam.
...of your most memorable family experience.
A reminder though.
This is gonna be worth half of your final grade.
Leave him alone.
I'm going for a record.
"I said, ""leave him alone."""
You want to take his place midget?
Yeah.
Sure.
"Ok, everybody, got any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
"Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented."
"A game of skill, agility, cunning."
A game with one simple rule.
Dodge.
Sorry.
"Uh, substitute coach Roth."
Yes?
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous.
Take a lap!
But...
Go nuts.
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Whoa!
"Hey, there's no one driving that thing!"
Ho!
Someone stop it!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Easy.
"Easy, boy."
You boys lose something?
- That was scary.
- Officer!
Good.
I've never seen such a thing.
Shouldn't we bring those boys in or something?
"Trust me, whatever punishment we give them, it's nothing compared to what's waiting for them at home."
"Those boys know if anything was to happen to that horse, if it got injured, the whole family would lose its ability to plow the field, make food for the winter."
So that's it?
"They're just gonna feel really, really guilty?"
It works.
Believe me.
It won't happen again.
"I guess growing up here, you know all this stuff."
You have no idea.
Where are we?
"Ohio, somewhere."
I miss Mommy.
I know.
Me too.
I thought I had improvised well.
"- That's right, sire."
Stop.
We repeat.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, it is best to avoid any comment."
Sorry.
His Majesty?
Very well.
"Yes, I'll be careful."
"I care for you, do not worry."
"I think so, yes."
"See you, His Majesty."
Mr. Lloyd?
The Queen told me to remember them
To film the speeches from start to finish and to grasp the smiles.
Do we do it again?
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
I remember that Turkey's handshakes are energetic.
Stop.
Perfect.
"Now we can go, sire."
"Mr. Lloyd, can follow us."
It's really tiny.
The Atomium?
"Yes, it's a fiasco."
No.
"Well, that too."
The space reserved for Mini-Europe.
It looks like an extension of Turkey instead of the opposite.
Now.
- Na.
I did not remember what I wanted unfortunately.
- Something is other entirely.
- Oh see!
This is the trouble!
The start is very plain though.
"It would be necessary to think of it only, how you did the boxes before me arriving here."
"Ágika cut the cardboards, I folded."
And kind Tót what did he do?
- I got some air.
- Oh see!
Oneagainst one!
"I cut the cardboards alone though now, you though three people you make the folding,"
three against one.
"He has time to look at butterflies at night, to doze and you let your thoughts ramble."
- And why?
- Why?
- Why?
- Ágika?
"I believe it, because the our margin-cutting small."
Bravo!
For your daughter is golden mind.
"Thank you, Ágika."
"Is child's play, the others already!"
"Right, kind Tót?"
Yees!
- Good night!
- Good night!
He kissed me.
"You saw it, mom?"
Daddy!
How many?
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.
"- Luka, let me take this."
"- It's okay, I got it."
"Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance."
"- Breathe for us, Trina."
- Tracheal shift.
Hold up.
Her lung is down.
"- Sats, only 88."
"- Miss, can you describe who did this?"
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.
- Want me to do it?
"- No, 18 gauge."
How many were there?
"You' re gonna get your ID as soon as she's stable, I promise."
She's not moving air.
No pulse.
Try the other side.
"- No, pull the dressing off."
- What?
"The dressing on the chest wound, pull it off."
"- Okay, pulse is stronger."
- Good chest excursions.
"All right, let's get her inside."
Luka?
Just need a minute.
"Dr. Lewis, patron saint of lost causes."
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.
Come!
Mada mada da ne.
That'll be all.
Good afternoon!
Captain...
"Playing a match without approval, twenty rounds around the court."
But I-
Forty rounds.
Yes.
The rest of you start your high-intensity training.
The first years pick the balls.
Yes.
You're the team captain.
Please give me your guidance.
I will join next semester.
"First, hand up a registration form."
"Ah, okay."
Oyaji.
"Oh, Ryoma."
"Gave me a scare there, what're you doing here?"
Is your mother doing fine?
It's outrageous.
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?
It's called Seishun Gakuen.
Nothing spectacular.
"Why, don't like it?"
"Don't tell me that to get me into that school, you brought me here all the way from the States?"
"Well, you can say that."
How about it?
Let's have a game.
Here then.
I'll crush you.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
Black.
Damn it!
What do you want?
"You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed."
Gunzel was no serial killer.
Not in the usual sense.
He was filling orders.
And not just for Hiromitsu.
Orders?
From whom?
Someone called lrezumi.
There are collectors...
Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
There are others...
- Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison.
He couldn't have committed every murder.
If it was murder!
All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing.
Come on.12
Has Gunzel's death been made public?
Tomorrow.
- We have to stop it.
Until we knowwho's behind it.
We?
"- Yeah, I wanna work the case again."
What's the lawyer's name?
Schoubya.
Frank Schoubya.
"Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again."
I'll clear things with my superiors.
I got him!
"Catherine, oh, I've always loved that name."
"- Beautiful day, huh?"
- Sure is.
"- Thank you, Catherine."
- Thank you.
Have a nice day.
[Sighs]
Man: [On TV] Finding the right chair is hard.
- [Applause]
- Man:
Incredible inven...
Man:
You can get your dream kitchen for...
Man:
"To the DCPA's credit, this thing hasn't happened at all before."
"In fact, this is a rarity, and so they apologize to all those folks."
- Those folks...
- 44 will be the coolest that we've had.
- You have to go back to August...
- [Snoring]
- To the north and west...
- [Tablet chiming]
"Back out toward the northwest plateau,"
"Craig Beeker, that is a freeze warning."
"- Basically, if you had..."
"- Oh, shit."
[Phone rings]
I'm sure the check is in the mail.
Hello.
"Can you hold on a second, please."
"Hey, Ellen."
It's the joy of teaching which is the reward.
How many Tiles belong?
112.
"You got it, sweetheart."
- Just tell me when.
- Fantastic!
You'll come for dinner before?
- I'll make a brisket.
- I love brisket.
Get home safe.
"Well, I'm taking a cab anyway."
Thanks again.
"Hello, Larry."
"- I got to see you, Frank."
"- Well, here I am."
How about a cup of coffee?
"No, thanks."
We got to talk.
Are you finished here?
"Well, the business of government is never finished."
"Come on, let's take a walk."
Mister A!
"How are you, Milton?"
I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl With no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy
"Speaking of blueberry pies bring us a couple, Milton."
"You, à la mode?"
"No, thank you."
I don't want any pie.
Apple for him.
"And coffee, Milt."
Put the web cam in on.
I will watch it all.
- Done brother-in-law.
"Bring faster, like a bride!"
My friends arrived!
Hi..
"Hi, buddy.."
- Hi dude.
Happy marriage anniversary!
- Thank you!
Come.
All these are my childhood friends.
Hello.. hi.
"You would have passed Degree, by the age they were in diapers, right brother-in-law?"
"Do not search for logic, you will miss magic."
Happy wedding anniversary Tukaram sir.
- Thank you very much..
Our Vasundhara madam has sent this gift for you.
Oh..
Thank you.
Take and keep this inside.
"Madam, this is your marriage day."
Can we see your marriage album?
That is..
Album got burnt in the fire accident.
"Buddy, let us start the party."
"- PK must come, right?"
"You mean PSPK, Is Pawan Kalyan coming for the party?"
[PSPK:
PowerStarPawanKalyan]
It is not PSPK who is coming.
"Just PK, my friend."
"Oh my God, you're serious!"
So where were we?
What am I wearing?
"Well, nothing, naturally."
Ha!
Ha!
Charles?
Hello?
Charles?
Charles!
Battery!
No!
[ Her screams echoes. ]
[ Amaar is banging his head on the table. ]
I can't believe you built a bomb.
I didn't build a bomb!
I merely collected a bunch of things that look like bomb-making things!
"It was not a crime, just suspicious and very costly."
"- Well, you proved your point."
"- I know, and it breaks my heart!"
"Then why'd you do it, Baber?"
Because I was happy with the way things are!
[ He starts whining. ]
OK!
"Baber, that's what this is about?"
"Look, nothing's going to change!"
The mosque will always be there for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
"By this time tomorrow,"
We'll be in solitary confinement together.
[ The door opens. ]
OK!
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
Now.
"Come on, up the rigging."
Get up!
Come on now!
"Up the rig, there."
Have they died up there?
Keep it moving!
Much better.
You've accomplished wonders with them.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Don't press them too hard.
Twelve minutes 45 seconds to beat.
They'll do it this time.
- Is he badly hurt?
"- Leg broken, sir."
Get him to the surgeon.
- That'll be enough drill for today.
"- Carry on, down below."
- Dismiss the starboard watch!
- Mr. Scott-Padget will you have dinner with me?
- Starboard watch secure.
"- Thank you, sir."
- What about the man injured today?
- Not too good.
I may have to take the leg off.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Scott-Padget asked if he can return to duty.
- You don't like him.
- I've served with him before.
- When?
- In the Beedle.
"Bad ship, that was."
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
Shut up!
Help!
...
Saw your bro's name card and I saw a deal.
The person who killed your bro has a tattoo.
It's a scorpion.
Take it.
Thought you've principles?
Why pay me?
For your medical bills.
Thanks Mr. Lin.
I'd waited for you whole night.
Our fight is not over.
You still want to fight?
I'm not in the mood.
Then I win.
Since I defeated you
I'll help with your bro's case.
I'm the best cop around.
Even when suspended?
"Suspended, not resigned."
I've the highest record for cases solved.
Widest network of informers.
I know.
Using money.
Can you not shoot me down?
I'll find the killer very soon.
How soon?
I give you 3 weeks.
I don't need 3 weeks.
"Once done, you go back home quickly."
To your place of origin.
She and Agesha would yo along well.
I'll talk to Ma
To Nitu
I would like to introduce you to my little brothers
This is Jai
That's Jagadish
"I tried to evade them, but they forced me to drink some rum"
"Friends, in our times... where will you find brothers who love so dearly?"
My brothers are like my limbs
Get out
Time to buy a bigger car.
This is the one that stays
Jagadish...
- Take care of that kid.
He's high
Playing big brother.
"Jagadish, you knock"
What's up?
"Tonight, we're happy!"
Reason being...
Jai has found a daughter-in-law for you
I even okayed her
But who is she?
She's a foreigner.
But she's Indian
"Say yes, Ma."
- Ma's over there
"Say yes, Ma"
Say yes
"Say yes, Ma..."
one minute!
Happy days!
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
-Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
-Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
(GRUNTS)
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
-Bite down.
-l think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
(breathing heavily)
(panting)
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)
(GASPS)
That was bizarre.
(sighs)
(EXHALES)
Emerson!
I'll force him to fight!
What do you mean?
"If you kill them, how can we tell which faction is superior?"
So you tricked us!
You filthy woman!
You induced me to avoid the archery.
You all go out!
"Sister, what are you doing?"
"Brother, you must not kill them now."
You go away!
"Brother, forget about it!"
Brother!
"Jun-kit, what strike is that?"
Please excuse me!
Come on!
Good strike!
You haven't learned this sword before.
He certainly hasn't!
"Fung-wu, I'll give it back."
You fight better than me!
Take the sword.
Just fight!
You haven't seen this Chin Kang Fist before.
"Brother, stop."
He's changing styles.
I'll see what else they've got!
How about my fist?
You want to learn?
"Brother, are you hurt?"
"It's alright, I haven't hurt him!"
Ridiculous.
Go!
Really?
That should be OK ln you get
What is it?
is something wrong?
Should I leave you alone?
Of course
- Gentlemen
- Sir
- Are you OK?
"- Yes, sir"
Here.
Two boys were caught in the cemetery searching a grave I'm dealing with it
Searching a grave?
Why did you do it?
It wasn't desecration was it?
What were you after?
It was Camille Séguret's grave
Did you know her?
Where is the body?
"When the watchman caught you, it was gone lt wasn't there"
- Where is it?
- We never touched it
Where is Camille Séguret?
What do you mean?
"She was buried there, wasn't she?"
So where is she now?
I think she's back
Back?
Back from where?
From the dead
It's hard to describe
"First, I saw a great light that dazzled me lt felt like I was going blind"
"Hey, asshole !"
Come!
Get it!
You created the wrong gangster!
I love the taste of black blood in the morning!
The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern.
I thought he was dead.
The turns of electronics.
We are approaching the death zone.
You're good?
Motherfucker!
"The electronics are fine, Commander."
"Well, Kix!"
What a sight you have so extreme.
I've never seen a noid with hair.
"Because they do not grow hair, asshole."
Mutated Humanoids.
True.
- This is a Sammy 69-7-H.
- A Sammy 69-7-H?
"This is an old model of pleasure, is not it?"
"They probably lost their virginity, did not they, Hatta?"
- Are you cold?
- No sir.
Pack it in the tank!
Can you walk on that leg?
Yes.
"You're going to make it, brother."
Ice teaches all humility.
It shows us our limits.
Our weaknesses.
Our humanity.
What happened?
I yawned.
Will be best if I am packing and i'm on my way.
"I think, I was not the wrong one."
"I asked it, you are not sleepy."
"But, he not sleepy, respectable major lord."
Why did he yawn then?
Why you yawned my Lajos?
I don't know.
Only some.
Only some?
Did you yawn because you feel well possibly?
"Yes, major lord."
"Here you go to believe, major lord."
That's right.
"Please make a statement, dear Tót."
What would you do now the with pleasure?
- May I be honest?
- Of course.
Well...
I now the with pleasure...
I would make a box a little.
Yes?
"- And you, Mariska?"
- I too.
- Ágika?
"- I too, of course"
If you insist on him this much...
I do not regret it.
"I ask you for it only, let this not occur repeatedly."
No.
Never again.
-Swimming?
Can not know what we become.
"Beauty, eat plankton the rest of your life."
"But that's what we are, are herbivores."
-We are vegetarians.
What?
For everyone devour us.
I am no longer so to be on the menu.
-Where you going?
-Go up the food chain.
Food chain?
"I chew something that has ""Face."""
I do not remember that.
It always seems that everything different in the back.
So I think we should go the other way.
The land of emperors is opposite.
Why not go there.
"No, no, this is better."
-But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always.
"What is, is not that far."
"Guys, stop."
"Erik, I had to stop."
Okay.
Okay.
"Continue, but pay attention and go slowly."
"It is best not to look down, okay."
"Atticus, what I said."
"Good day, a champion!"
Where to go?
In-house.
-It is.
It was only for a month because the competition was in May
And in June Montenegro declared itself independent.
"Since they are from Montenegro, they gave the title to a Serb."
Bitch.
I remember this story.
In Belgrade they got stubborn and they gave me this job.
"It's not a happy ending, right?"
"I'm sure, Mr. Duncan Lloyd,"
This is a very interesting job.
Serbia enjoys dancing.
"- Thank you, I'll do it."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"Incredible, I really recognized it."
The Finns.
The capital of the Falklands?
- Stanley.
The first country to adopt Christianity?
Armenia.
The first atheist state?
I have no idea.
- Albania.
Does he make you happy?
Does the camera make you feel right to dig in the lives of others?
It depends.
And what noble purpose?
The search for beauty...
And the truth.
"Okay, give it to me."
- Thing?
The camcorder.
Me dia.
"She looked at me, but didn't see me."
"- But, tonight..."
- Tonight?
"Hey, I buy her!"
- What's going on?
- What do you think?
"Passports, tickets, cha cha cha!"
Duvigny.
Defarge.
Theron.
Fuselli.
Salesman.
Ten foggy days in Budapest?
"I just started my shift, detective."
We're just chatting with a friend from Budapest.
"We're in first class, coach 15."
Hungarian.
Thank you.
Can you show me your luggage?
"of course, enthusiastically sir!"
To be enthusiastic means to be inhabited by God!
Brilliant.
Hey...
"If cops freak you out, how will you ever make it with women?"
Brothers with different names...
and I'm not a friend from Buda.
"Hey, Dumbo!"
Look!
Isn't it grand?
"You will meet her, you will see her, but you will never believe what you see!"
Isn't Paris more rich than your Buda-shit?
- Nobody picking you up?
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
Take look.
This uniform transforms a common man into a hero.
- I see.
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy...
- into a macho-man.
- Idea.
What?
Idea.
Only you can save me from suspension now.
- What?
- You take my place.
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.
- Zoravar can...
- Hold on uncle.
This is impossible I cannot do it.
Why do you think the ACP chose me?
Because he knows it's just a formality.
And I assure you... she will believe you're Zoravar.
Because she has never seen me.
It's headfirst to Delhi.
It's just fo rthree days.
Here's her photograph.
What's the problem?
- Ankita!
- Yes she's...
You know her?
Yes I know her very well.
We met last year during the Jaipur lnter-college festival.
Her voice.
Her eyes.
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different.
I told them how the world really works.
"How there were predators, how we had to adapt."
"I led them here, under the great ice."
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
"Well, we all have a purpose."
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
"Wait and see, Will."
You wait and see.
[ELEPHANT SEALS GRUNTING]
[BOTH ROARING]
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
"Don't know, but it sure is ugly."
"Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?"
Right.
"Outside, now!"
We are outside.
"- Come on, then."
- No... you come on.
MUMBLE:
Excuse me.
Bryan?
- Huh?
MUMBLE:
Down here.
"Ah, g'day, chief."
What are you doing here?
"Bryan, I need a favor."
A big one.
"For you, champ, anything."
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
Champagne?
"- Whoa, baby!"
- What are we celebrating?
We're celebrating that we've been living together for a month.
Almost.
OK...
To being flatmates for a month.
- Almost.
"- Sit down, please."
"So, what are we having, then?"
- Having?
- Dinner?
In the oven!
Did you like what you just saw?
Yes.
You're a very attractive woman.
But I think we should just keep it as flatmates.
Having a good time doesn't have to change anything.
"You have needs, and I have needs."
What would be more sensible than to try and fulfil those needs   in the comfort of our own home?
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Sit down!
Turn off your brain and relax.
"Camilla, I don't..."
Just relax.
- Camilla...
- Shhh!
(music gets more aggressive)
(music stops abruptly)
Sorry!
Sorry.
I guess it's time for a shower.
"I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe."
Sort out what our parents left behind.
At least I'd be useful there.
"Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation."
Yeah.
You Okay?
Just need to get to Candor.
Tris.
"I know you think Caleb is your responsibility, but he made his own choice."
You can't protect everyone.
(CHUCKLES)
I can't protect anyone.
Nobody can.
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.
(SIGHS)
Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.
Thank you.
WOMAN ON PA:
All factions have been instructed to
-maintain a strict curfew until further notice.
- We gotta move.
Repeat.
All factions have been instructed to maintain a strict curfew until further notice.
- We found them.
-Yeah.
- HECTOR:
Four!
-(ALL GREETING)
"Damn, is it good to see you guys."
"How are you, Uriah?"
Worse than you?
You don't say anything but I hear it.
Go away.
"You can't do it, I'll deal with him myself."
Here he comes.
You are...?
Don't you know me?
How can I not know you?
What's this?
You don't know me but you know her?
You stop.
"We are friends, right?"
- You come with me.
- Where to?
Dicky?
What's this dicky?
Not only at night he's different in day time also.
Actually we are not friends but lovers.
Are we lovers?
I don't believe it.
You must believe it.
How can I?
Was I such a violent guy?
- Remember it?
- Remember it?
How can he remember past with just one scene?
Continue it.
It happened like this then...
When?
"Did you think I forgot everything, right?"
I remember everything.
"What do you remember, sunny?"
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?
With Toxie lovemaking.
She's been established.
So there wasn't really too much we could do.
[Inaudible] [gasp]
"Yeah, baby."
It's good for the baby.
HEIDI SJURSEN:
"Oh, baby."
[Moan]
[Moan]
Cut.
It's done that way just to [inaudible].
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I'm just trying to convince the actress
"To take her clothes off, something which was contracted"
"To, and something which was agreed upon,"
"Something which was rehearsed, and something"
Which was pre-recorded on tape.
INTERVIEWER:
And this isn't gonna happen?
That's what's going on.
But now we're gonna shoot Toxie.
Who's doing Toxie's makeup?
Anybody doing Toxie's makeup?
Or are we not making this movie?
"Yeah, we have somebody who's doing it."
[Chatter]
MAN:
"Lloyd, it was a closed set."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yes, I agree."
But people can stand by.
It looks firm enough if we walk on the edge there.
"- Uh, sod that, you're carrying me."
- What?
"Shoes, 300 quid, come on."
Down you go.
Spoken like a true lady.
"Paul, be careful!"
"Luke, my shoes!"
"Quickly, before they fall in the mud!"
"- Oh, my goodness!"
- Ugh... elegance.
Elegance!
Hop on.
"Right, here we go."
So...
How've you been?
Good.
"Great, actually."
- You?
- Okay.
Course has definitely been an eye-opener
Really?
"Yeah, you meet all these different kinds of people."
"I mean, most of 'em work their arses off to get what we just take for granted."
Makes you realise you're not quite as special as you once thought.
"Bloody hell, Chris, that was bordering on self-deprecation."
Is it working?
"You haven't changed at all, have you?"
- What's the matter?
- Not funny...
Great.
Hi.
So you didn't do anything to those women?
No.
Then where did you go every night?
- My part time job.
- Job?
Part-time?
So you bought meat with that money?
Yeah!
So why did you bring that dog here?
It's only skin and bones.
Not even worthy to eat.
Big trouble!
Big trouble!
Come out!
Your daughter and Mr. Hong...
Mr. Hong kidnapped your daughter!
Come out!
What?
I came here to take the plates back.
Hold on tight!
Stop the car!
Hey!
Stop the car!
Get closer!
"This motorcycle is so slow, what's wrong with it?"
Pull me up!
That damn bastard!
Is everyone still on?
"Dad, over there!"
I wasn't planning on killing you.
But you're just like the other bitches.
All hookers like you playing with all kinds of men have to die.
Hang on.
Let me close the restaurant.
He is here.
Take it.
Thank you very much.
I'll leave.
Shall I drop you somewhere?
Thanks.
I've a knowledge of every nook and corner of this locality.
Bye.
"Your article by Sadhana is very good, isn't it?"
It requires a big heart to appreciate you
- Mom.
Get me chappathis.
Despite owning a restaurant
You are still eating mom's food.
I know where this conversation will end.
Don't be boring.
Okay?
Welcome.
"Did the elderly man ask for food, today as well?"
No.
"But, how did you know that it was me?"
"Your deodorant brand is Nivea, right?"
You are awesome.
"I forgot to pay the bill, yesterday."
How much was it?
- It's Okay.
If I get the money
The credit for the good deeds will go to you.
No need.
Sorry.
This is just fine.
Thank you very much.
No.
Thank you very much.
You've made me very happy.
"Very, very happy."
Where's Clark?
"He's talking to Grandma, sitting on the bench."
I saw them shake hands.
I feel as though I saw something very nice.
That's wonderful!
And the boy a rose did see
"The tone, it's all fixed!"
Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?
How about that?
Let's sing!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field
Bravo!
You sound like angels.
This was amazing.
Is this Uncle's room?
This is your bed.
"Oh, my God."
Okay?
Okay.
Not bad!
# He sang as if he knew me #
Will.
# In all my dark despair #
We're finished.
# And then he looked right through me # # as if I wasn't there #
"Will, come on."
"Will, we're finished."
"So there I was, killing them softly with my song."
"Or rather, being killed."
"And not that softly, either."
I was singing with my eyes closed.
Was I frightened?
I was petrified.
This was definitely not island living.
# Killing me softly #
# With his song ##
"Thank you, Finsbury."
I'd like to introduce one or two members of the band.
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.
And that's about it.
Let's get off quick.
Get off.
"Marcus, thank you."
For the song.
You were terrific.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate."
Okay.
How about McDonald's?
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
Severe lower body trauma.
Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey, how's it going?"
I hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.
Yeah.
I'm working the Pine Street Bombings.
"I'm her partner,"
Dr. Diego Soto.
Hey.
Sandman.
Golden age.
Nice.
Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh, why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one, please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"Hey, did you see psycho there?"
"Oh, yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.
I have every issue of Sandman.
Mint condition.
"You know, if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh, I am."
I love them when they're silly.
"But if they get too silly, they have to come see me."
"- ""Silly""?"
- Mischief.
- Trouble.
- We use gentler terms.
As a policy.
"Well, so what happens when they come see you?"
"Well, we do things a little differently in our program."
The approach is progressive and positive.
"We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids."
"Because 99% of the time, all kids need"
- is a hug.
"- ""A hug""?"
- A squeeze.
"- Well, you squeeze 'em."
- An embrace.
- Oh.
- Oh?
- Well...
- What is it?
- Nothin'.
- Wayne.
- Yeah?
- Speak freely.
"- No, I'd better not."
That's the only way we'll get to know each other.
But do you ever smack 'em?
- Excuse me?
"- Like, give 'em a good whack?"
- I don't follow.
- Do you ever hit the kid?
Worth's half a million!
is she inlaid with diamonds?
Ridiculous!
Thank you...
"Hello Sam, how are you?"
I'm Joe!
Why so many foreigners in white suit here tonight?
A Yank's grandma get married the 8th time to an officer.
They are holding a party to celebrate!
You still remember this song?
"Of course I remember, you cruise chick with this song."
"Play it again, Sam!"
You want a woman?
What?
"You dirty pimp, leave my husband alone!"
"The soup's tasteless, add some soya sauce!"
What?
Add some soya sauce!
Did you say 'Get some sort of toys'?
Did you...?
"- Must be you, I'm damn sure!"
- American.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Sandra!"
You want woman?
He wants to kill me!
Get some sort of toys!
Help yourself!
I'm American!
American!
He run away!
"Hi, Hitler!"
- Hotel Hong Kong!
"I mean, of course, it needs a lot of work, but wow!"
I think I'm having goose bumps.
Oh!
The minbar can go right there.
And my office can be in that room with the family
- Of angry racoons!
- Yes!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Why is there a team
- With a wrecking ball out front?
"- Like I said, the place is scheduled for demolition."
- [Together]:
Today?
"- Yeah, in 15 minutes or so."
"But don't worry, guys!"
I can find you a place exactly like this...
probably.
- Can't we stop them?
- No.
Only the mayor can stop the demolition now.
- How do you even know that?
- She likes to brag.
"You guys really want this place, don't you?"
- More than anything!
- Huh.
- OK.
You go find Ann and I'll stay here and make sure
- They don't tear it down.
- Brilliant!
[ Rayyan sighs. ]
"You know, haiukon."
Just...
- How was your journey?
- Great.
Thanks.
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.
Wow.
This way.
Are they... seeing?
It's cool.
Very cool.
Wow.
Come on.
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.
I'm gonna need your phone and anything else you might use to send and receive.
"- A little paranoid, don't you think?"
- Can't be too careful.
"Okay, there you go."
"Wow, you really are paranoid."
Whoa!
It's white.
Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like, I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
- I promise.
- Okay.
And you damaged our cargo.
CALEB:
These are Abnegation fabric bolts.
"And you're Factionless, right?"
- Caleb.
-I used to be Abnegation.
We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you.
You're saying that we're stealing from you?
No.
"No, no, no."
I'm no longer Abnegation.
"So technically you're not stealing from me, but... (STAMMERS) No, you're not stealing at all."
"I mean, maybe."
"It's a question of semantics, I suppose, whether it's stealing or charity."
(STAMMERING) But it's all really the same.
TRIS:
That's enough!
Get off!
"Everybody, relax."
"All right, you made your point."
"We'll get off your train, all right?"
Got you.
"Will just everybody relax, okay?"
"Why don't we, uh, take a seat!"
(GRUNTS)
- TRIS:
Caleb!
-(ALL CLAMORING)
- FOUR:
Stop!
"-I'm sorry,"
- I was just trying to help.
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Chun-bae.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 10 grand, don't you think?"
I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
You will not leave before the summer?
We can no longer trespass upon your sister's goodwill.
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.
Edward has long been expected by our mother.
"Come as soon as you can, Edward."
"Remember, you're always welcome."
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen...
Forgive me.
Miss Dashwood...
Elinor...
I must speak to you.
There is something of great importance that I need to tell you...
about my education.
- Your education?
- Yes.
It was conducted.
"oddly enough, in Plymouth."
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth?
No.
I was four years there.
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.
- Pratt?
- Precisely.
Pratt.
While I was there...
"That is to say, he had a..."
has a...
You're needed in London this instant.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lots!"
"All right, all right."
You'll be kissing the gunner's daughter before too long.
Get her out to sea while the tide's still with us.
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
"Aye, Captain."
Stow the prisoners.
Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.
Now!

"[gun pops, thud, baby coos]"

"- nice shot, little man!"
- [laughs]
"- so sorry about the mess, but we were not expecting company."
"- amanda jones, department of children and family services."

"- oh, absolutely not."
"please, mrs. jones, have a look-see."
[dogs barking in distance]
- yep.

"yeah, i probably would've sold you one night, harley, just to be with him, hmm?"
why is she jotting that down?
- [sighs]
- where are you going?
- to talk with tim in town.
- what?
now?
"- yeah, i promised uncle bob."
- i'll drive you.
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?
How far will that get you?
You can't even take your mistress on a weekend trip.
Nothing.
"All right, fine."
"But tomorrow morning, these people are going to be in my office."
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.
I'll explain everything.
"They'll understand, don't worry."
Anything else?
Your appointment is here.
Who is this guy?
Remind me.
Joseph Kay.
Heads up a department at St. Louis.
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?
Something like that.
"""Something like that."""
"""I'm not sure what he wants."""
What's that supposed to mean?
Why send him to me?
- You were recommended.
- By who?
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.
I see.
- Your daughter called.
"- Oh, yeah?"
She left you messages at home and...
Romeo.
"Oh, no."
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."
No.
No.
No.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no."
So pale?
My best beloved husband lies here dead.
Not Romeo.
My child.
Not him of all.
"Oh, what unkind hour has brought to pass this miserable deed."
"Alas, my lady, we are overturned."
No.
A greater power than we can contradict has thwarted all our plans.
"Come away from death, contagion and unnatural sleep."
Leaving my husband to face this alone?
The watchman.
"My lady, come away."
Unkind!
To drink it all and leave no drop so I could follow after.
"Nay, good my lady."
Listen now and come.
I will hide you in a sisterhood of nuns.
"Stop, stop, not to question why."
- We must away.
- You go.
I must bid farewell to Romeo.
"Stay then, until you are at peace."
But linger not.
Get out!
Come here!
What are you smiling for?
You deaf person!
Gate?
!
Out?
!
Get out!
Who?
Then say so!
Why beat around the bush?
"Won't you go away, rascal?"
He was eating my head!
And why were you asking them?
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
This girl has shot into my heart like a bullet.
"She sells flowers, yet fires bullets."
That's why it's said that one cannot trust the female species.
When I was hit with the bullet the first time...
- ...it hadn't been so painful.
"- But the pain is sweet, isn't it?"
- But what next?
- What do you mean?
Will this matter proceed further or not?
How will it proceed further?
You know I cannot do a thing.
I too don't know anything.
I haven't fallen in love often.
Brother!
"How are you, brother?"
How cute.
Jackknife.
That technique isn't too bad.
All the different smashes in tennis sure benefit you guys.
Too bad your ball isn't high enough.
Sorry but I've checked your data.
The data won't lie.
If not for the data you would have played better.
- What are you doing?
- Woot?
Ugh.
What was that?
What was that?
Doing that by yourself.
Makes one so nostalgic.
"This Seigaku regular uniform,"
- Not too shabby.
- Heh?
"Let's have a game at the usual place, okay."
Let's go.
When did he come in...
- Everybody gather.
- Hai!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The opposing team is Seishun Middle School finally we get to play.
I still haven't accepted you.
"Ah, I see."
"Hey, look at that."
What's this?
A chibi here.
How come even a chibi can become a regular.
Give it back to the women.
"Oh, thanks very much."
Little chap.
You're looking much better today.
Come on!
- Did you hear what that idiot asked of me?
"- No, what?"
- I wasn't allowed to take any holiday...
- Prisoners!
They're escaping!
Quickly!
- We must get away!
- What about John?
Better him than us.
Stop!
"Stop, or I'll shoot!"
"Come on, let's get away from here."
"Damn, it won't open!"
- The parcel has arrived.
- OK.
Let's have a look over there.
They're in there.
- Why didn't the capo come along?
- The town is crawling with militia.
- This is Smithy.
- Good work.
Thank you.
"For you, no effort was too great."
A tanker is going to take you out of town.
- The north would be too dangerous.
- I don't care about north or south.
- All I want is to fight Ramírez.
Owen...?
Flavors that are wow...
Dinner time honey...!
"....and these Thy gifts, for which we are about to receive,"

And protect us from evil.
Amen.
How was school today?
"you didn't go and spoil your dinner on me now, did you?"
Owen?
...No...
I didn't...
Eat.
"Please, honey."
Hello?
What?
"Look, I'm not gonna discuss this now?"
We're eating dinner
"we had an agreement, John."
I think maybe you better call my lawyer okay...?
Don't talk to me like that
I will not.
Be spoken to.
In that way!

Yes.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Yes.
Tell me.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Indeed I am.
Tell me.
Are you really Inspector Arivazhagan?
"Who is this at my station, questioning me?"
"Hey, Panju!"
Sir!
- Come here!
Sir?
Find out what this man wants.
"Okay, Sir."
Come.
Did I really speak to the Inspector?
Yes.
Why are you bugging us?
"Tell me, is he really Inspector Arivazhagan?"
"Yes, he is."
You came so furiously to meet this very same Arivazhagan.
Manoj.
"Manoj, please relax."
I can understand that you are in some trouble.
Your car was involved in the accident.
The person with you must have driven the car.
Your intention of saving her is not wrong.
But a life has been lost.
"Don't get scared, Manoj."
We are not dealing this case officially.
"Only if you tell the truth, we can save you and your friend."
"Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense."
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

You get anything?
Yeah.
The cell that led us to Cutler?
Yeah.
Found something interesting on it.
What?
"All right, so according to Abby,"
Cutler used this phone exclusively to contact her.
Right.
But... look at this.
The last number Cutler dialed was to a different number.
Right.
And check out the time.
10:51.
"That's two minutes after the shooting started, which means that not only did Cutler not die instantly..."
He was alive long enough to place a phone call.
Let me see that.
Exactly.
(phone speed dialing)

AUTOMATED VOICE:
We're sorry...
Disconnected?
Yeah.
Probably a burner.
"Okay, so this guy, he takes two at close range, he's bleeding out."

We need to find out who was on the other end.

"I don,t know."
"Put ,slightly unhappy, if you want."
"I don,t want anything."
"It,s up to you."
What do you want?
"She doesn,t know and neither do I!"
"Don,t check anything!"
Fine.
"Then we,re done."
"Good, we,re done."
"Let,s have a drink."
How about having a drink with us?

Are you allowed during work hours?
"It,s not that."
"We,re way behind schedule."

Our door is always open.
Thanks.

"Listen, we were wondering:"
How did you end up working here?
"- You think it,s weird?"
"- I,m not criticizing."
"It,s just... you dissect people, examine them, manipulate them."
"We don,t manipulate anyone."
I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk?
Always.
Is something wrong?
I know you have high aspirations for me
So in the spirit of full disclosure
There's something you need to know
Something that may... it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer...
I had an affair
With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she...
Well she paid me.
Well...
Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.

So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."

"Oh, shit!"
Bollocks.
Well done.
Well done?
"You got here, though."
What do you want from me?
Hey!
Who's in there?
Over here!
Better run.
Hey!
Stop!
"Come back here, you!"
No.
Old things.
Clothing.
"Hey, he's at the salvation army."
"Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army."
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
[kids grunting]
[indistinct chatter]
[tires screech]
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
[woman gasps] [woman] look out.
[man] watch it.
"[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I...
Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
[man] watch out.
[yelps]
Short circuit the control system.
[control system buzzes]
It's worthwhile to die in your arms.
"Yan-ling, you..."
The arrows feel uncomfortable.
"Please pull them out for me, so I can die more peacefully."
Fung-wu!
Take care of yourself!
Bring him away!
Yan-ling!
Yan-ling!
Yan-ling!
"Brother, Wu-tang..."
Wu-tang?
Wu-tang?
We'll be enemies forever!
I!
"Chao Fung, this is a Wu-tang closet for meditation."
You better do your penance here!
Amida Buddha!
Sir!
Please wait.
Amida Buddha!
Shaolin stands high on a mountainous pinnacle and is the origin of all martial arts.
Please give me a chance.
We can't just accept students on their own behalf.
Please treat this as an exceptional circumstance.
I can't make that decision.
Who can?
The Chief Monk!
I'll look for him!
Please don't disturb him.
He's in the chamber resting.
I traveled here with hardship.
"As promised, yes"
Please we'll be forever grateful
Farewell...
"Miss, please"

You...
"You didn't expect me, did you?"
I saw it all
I'll repay you for your help to the Ming Cult but now I'll have to take the girl

He is one of the four guardians of the Ming Cult
Blood sucker the Green Bat
Blood sucker?
Yan Li
Yan Li...
"Strange, where did he go?"

Are you a ghost?
... why are you following me?
... who are you?
I can't tell why not?
I can't tell
why are you running around?
I have a friend who has been taken away by the Green Bat
Green Bat?
His martial art skill greatly excels yours
You are no match for him
I have to
Your things just flew out the window.
What?
You're part of the scenery.
"The air passes through, filling your entire body."
It flows out your finger tips.
Breathe with your toes to get the air into your toes.
The energy flowing in your toes fills you with vitality.
Your toes are laughing.
Good.
You're like air.
A cool breeze permeates your body.
You see a vision of divine beauty.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Who did this?
The Freemasons?
Are you from a bat lodge or something?
Leave me alone.
"Guys, I need help!"
Don't touch her!
"There's some wacko here, Peku!"
Are you fucking crazy or what?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Somebody was crying for help.
"The bride was tied up, her clothes all torn."
"I tried to help, but the Devil and Dracula attacked me."
Then they all just disappeared.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Girls no one can find anymore.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Their fathers are semillas geneticas... {\i1\cH80ffff}...special seeds in bottles.
{\i1\cH80ffff}
- Birthday?
No birth.
- Maria.
{\i1\cH80ffff}We do not dress them up for Halloween.
"{\i1\cH80ffff}We do not call them ""baby"" or kiss boo-boos."
{\i1\cH80ffff}Don't think of them as children.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Think of them as things... {\i1\cH80ffff}...with patents and copyrights.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Comprende?
senor.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They thought we were too poor... {\i1\cH80ffff}...and stupid to understand.
yes... {\i1\cH80ffff}...but we are not stupid.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Use your powers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}This is business.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They are making soldiers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Killers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}These are babies of mutantes...
North Dakota.
Mmm.
You took that woman's money.
You said you would take the child there.
What is she?
Logan.
Alkali has your genetic code.
Not just mine.
Logan...
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.
Logan...
Give it a thought.
Think about it.
It's my mistake to have had a tea without getting you one.
Have a tea in my credit.
Perumal...
Sir.
"If this program becomes a hit, your photo will become viral on social media."
People will praise you as the ideal cop.
"After which... promotion, salary hike..."
- Get lost.
Panju Sir!
Panju Sir!
How long will you be an underdog?
When will you rise to occasion?
I'm going to pee.
Step aside.
Sir.
"Okay, Sir."
Greetings.
Inspector asked to come here.
Didn't you bring your gun?
I wonder how you will manage without it!
Go upstairs.
"Hey, crow!"
"Perumal, one strong tea."
Make it two.
"- Okay, Sir."
"What's up, Sir?"
Would you like to have any fried snacks?
No tension!
I gave an idea to change your image altogether.
Now it's upto you.
She can be.
We will see.
"You are more attracted by the comical gendre,... than by the dramatic."
By the master of erotica.
Back in your dress.
"You have a great future ""behind'."
-What actress?
-More.
All of you!
Leave a photo with my secretary.
"-Thank you, maestro."
-Thanks.
We will keep a picture of yourself.
"-Thanks, maestro!"
-Thanks.
Thank you miss.
I told him that was exceptional.
Thanking you too.
"Here it is, I recommend it."
"- Archive ""A""?"
-How did you guess?
What are you doing tonight?
As I said.
I am going to the movies with my boyfriend.
You expect to get it outside of yourself?
I see what you're getting at!
But why?
"Because it won't let you go, before first telling you something about yourself."
Anything?
What?
Something or the other.
An adventure for example.
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
[tires squeal]
City property.
I've damaged city property.
[moaning]
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
[tires screech]
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
[boys cheering]
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window"
To magnify and shine so brightly
That our pursuers'll be blinded by it.
[glass breaking]
[van scrapes road]
"[muscles] come on, open the doors."
[crusher] I can't see.
- [Tia] yeah.
Suits you.

"And to Victor, the spoils."
(DOOR OPENS)
(GROANING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(CONTINUES GROANING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(YELLING)
"So, you're my benefactor."
You're the man behind all this.
(PANTING)
Don't worry.
There will be time to discuss how you can... (BREATHES HEAVILY) repay the debt.
(COURTIERS LAUGHING)
LOUIS:
Do I make a good Pilgrim?
"Well, Feron, am I transformed?"
"No garments, no matter how dreary, could disguise Your Majesty's regal bearing."
What do you think?
I think it would be safer if you were accompanied by a royal guard.
Why must you question my every decision?
Why?
I am angry now.
I was happy before and you have made me... (COUGHING)
(CONTINUES COUGHING)
"The Musketeer Aramis, as requested."
You are to accompany me on a pilgrimage.
"A pilgrimage, Your Majesty?"
"Well, you are a man of God, Aramis."
Or so you say.
What are you talking about?
People sleepwalk on those
Pills.
"They sleepwalk, they sleepdrive,"
They sleepeat.
There's a woman on the news
Talking about how she gained 100
Pounds while she was on weight
"Watchers cause every night,"
"Unbeknownst to her, she'd"
Sleepwalk down to the kitchen
And sleepeat her way through 2
"Bags of oreos, 4 pints of"
Haagen-Dazs and a dozen donuts.
What about sleepfoodshopping.
Talking about pointing the wrong
Finger.
Why do you still have the
Pills if you don't take them
Anymore?
Duh.
"I'm a junkie, OK?"
"But you quit now, right?"
"Yeah, but in case I had a"
"Relapse, I didn't want to have"
To go... searching for the pills.
"I was, I was planning ahead."
"Oh, yeah, for the bender that"
AA is supposed to stop you from
Having.
"Nice cult you joined, by the"
Way.
"- Hello, Jeanne."
- Hello.
May I ask why you're in such a good mood?
We're happy to see our favourite manager.
Good.
You'll smile less when you see the Décopril figures.
We'll have to be more... aggressive and tenacious!
Danou wants you.
- Now?
- It's urgent.
- Sounds like trouble up there.
- I'll go.
Get started.
"HIS SPRING, HER WINTER"
Come in.
"Hello, Jeanne."
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat.
Sit down.
"I'm listening, Maillet."
I'll be straight.
The parent company's made a decision.
"Staff at the south-west branch is being reduced, and..."
"- ""And""?"
- 10 jobs are going.
- That many?
"- Yes, 10."
"Under the circumstances, it's the only way to keep the branch running after the heavy losses, due to generic drugs."
"""Heavy losses""."
"Don't exaggerate, Hugues."
Latest results aren't...
Right.
Undoubtedly edward mace.
We have to leave before he gets here.
"There's precious little time,"
He could be outside already.
Why are you helping us
Against your own people?
I have my reasons.
I don't want your help.
(da veiga:)I know you find this
"Hard to believe, andreas,"
But I am trying to save your life.
Maybe we could continue this elsewhere.
[âª] [machine gun fire]
You set us up.
[machine gun fire]
Give me the dagger and the scabbard.
No!
(da veiga:)mace will have orders to take the contents
Of the case.
He will not leave without them.
I'm sure I can convince him
That you escaped.
What good are they to us
If we're dead?
"(andreas:)no, don't believe him."
He's lying.
He always lies.
Andreas!
No!
Third man's got the case.
[gun shots]
It's da veiga's son.
I was winning.
"They're beings, Trelane."
They have spirit.
They're superior.
"No, no."
You saw.
"You'll grow up, Trelane."
You'll understand.
Now come along.
"Aw, but you said I could."
You promised.
I never have any fun.
"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
"Aw, but you saw."
I was winning.
I would have won... honest.
"No, Trelane."
"No, Trelane."
I would have.
I would have.
I would have.
I would.
I would.
I would.
I would.
"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed."
Who are you?
Who is Trelane?
You must forgive our child.
The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
He will be punished.
We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.
Confirmed.
"Set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
- Where's that?
- Confirmed.
- What have you got there?
"- Why are we leaving them behind, what's going on?"
Where is Destiny?
!
"According to Avon, it's a story that doesn't have an end yet."
"All right then, we'll start with the beginning."
Probe.
Does this mean anything to you?
54124?
"- No, I don't think so."
- Should it?
Is it important?
"Yes, it is important."
Monitor response?
- The air is stale in here.
- The ventilator's closed.
- Well?
- Zero response.
There's nothing I can do.
It will have to be replaced.
I shall need laser transfer linkage.
Have you got any?
"I think so, in the storage hold."
I'll go and check.
"Stay here, I'll get it."
You'll need a torch.
[METALLIC CLICKING]
[ELECTRONIC HUM]
"Calm, we will put an unforgettable injection to him."
"That is, dont move..."
Quiet...
"Good, the analyses, are not of the best ones."
-Dame the x-ray.
"-Immediately, Professor."
This one is not a wonder either.
"It is clear, tomorrow we will make a small intervention and we will fix to him definitively."
Contentment?
"Cicchirini, take care of the preparations."
"It neglects, Professor."
"-Oh, Professor."
"-You let me pass, young lady?"
Water...
"Well, we followed with the habitual injections."
"You are in charge, Ms Cappia..."
Cappa...?
"Cappi, Profesor."
List.
"We made use to him, Doctor?"
It is already all preparation.
-All ready one.
-Calm.
Calm...
To this one it is necessary to operate to him emergency.
"Tomorrow no he can, happened is strike,"
"Now comes the weekend, we will operate Monday to him."
What happens?
Who has died?
You!
-You have been!
-No.
Only if you believe it is.
Sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
"However, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky."
"Where's your champion, Sister?"
Here.
"Hello, Um."
Six impossible things.
"Count them, Alice."
"One, there's a potion that can make you shrink."
(ROARS)
"Two, and a cake that can make you grow."
"So, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again."
We've never met.
"Not you, insignificant bearer."
"My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one."
That's enough chatter.
(JABBERWOCKY SHRIEKING)
"Three, animals can talk."
"Four, Alice, cats can disappear."
"Five,"
there's a place called Wonderland.
"Six,"
I can slay the Jabberwocky.
(ROARS)
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!
(SCREECHING)
(BANDERSNATCH ROARING)
(JABBERWOCKY SCREECHING)
Off with your head!
Kill her!
Ah.
"Dakers, it was."
I shouldn't think this place was quite her style -- a bit quiet for her.
"She's rather marvelous, isn't she?"
Mm.
She has married again?
LYALL:
"Number five, I think."
POIROT:
"Oh, mon Dieu."
LYALL:
"Looks a bit of a gorilla, doesn't he?"
"An animal attraction, would you think, Mr. Poirot?"
Well...
"Well, well, well, things are looking up."
Hello?
Hello.
"Been looking all over the place for you, little lady."
"Not out fishing today, Major?"
"Yes, earlier."
Didn't have much luck.
"Perhaps, Major Barnes, you were fishing too close to the shore."
I noticed you by the harbor.
I expect you're right.
Too much damn dynamiting going on.
Dynamiting?
The fishermen drop dynamite around here.
Damned lazy beggars.
"The fish, not being fools, keep out at sea."
[ Chuckles ]
[ Vehicle approaching ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Slowly.
"No. no, no, no."
Did--did you see that--that guy
With the--with that--that gun?
It--it erases your short-term--no.
Psst.
What the hell is up with you two?
Now who are you working for?
Secret service.
"But a department that you, sir, know nothing about."
I doubt that.
Now what department?
"It's a, um, archival department."
You're filing clerks
Running around shooting stun guns
At your own people?
"Oh, we didn't shoot you."
"All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys."
- Yeah.
Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I'll take it from here.
"Careful, archives."
"Paper cuts, they take days to heal."
That's hilar-- you're hilarious.
Very scared.
- So glad to see you.
- Thank you.
Not a damn word.
"Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse."
That is all.
Thank you.
The meeting's over.
Send the car.
Any new transfers recently?
Just a moment.
"No, not a single one."
"The police identified the body of reporter Takeshi Kurosaki, age 35."
His investigative reports unveiled a series of university scandals.
"The cause of death is unknown, but foul play isn't ruled out."
That was close!
Did you hit these?
I think so.
You broke the dolphin.
Who's that?
From the Administration.
And who are you?
Haven't seen you around.
This is Rin.
Department?
I'm not a student.
So you can't join the team.
"Ryuji, Iet her apply."
"If you can hit that strong, you should apply."
Alright!
I'm soaked!
Right down to the underwear.
This way.
It's quite easy to apply.
What's that?
A special training facility.
It's a restricted area.
"OK, I think we'll do physics, please."
"You've chosen physics, and we now reveal exactly what you'll be looking for."
"You'll have ten seconds to confer as a team, and then you answer on your own."
"Remember, you've got two passes, but the one wrong answer and your team will be locked out of the hive."
"So, you've chosen physics as a topic."
You are looking for electrical components.
You've got ten seconds to confer.
Ammeter...
"Diode, transistor..."
Ohmmeter...
Transformer.
"Batteries, Capacitor..."
Bulb.
"Capacitor, yes."
Resistor...
Time's up.
"Ned, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, two passes should you need them."
"You're looking for electrical components, reveal the hive."
Transistor.
"Transistor, correct."
Oliver.
You can pass.
Pass.
Marianne.
One pass left. 20 seconds.
One pass left.
Diode.
"Diode, correct."
Ned.
Pass.
Oliver.
I'm gonna go poop now
"Yep, go pump it out"
Yes ma'am
"Me, the hunter..."
Bon...
"Don't scare me like that, I almost peed my pants"
Bon...
Yes?
Bon...
I love you!
"Ever since we met on ""Monster Hunter"" online"
I'm a gross Otaku but I love you
With my spearing soul
I think Miyu is being physically and mentally abused
I am taking Miyu home
Miyu looks her best when she is smiling
She doesn't deserve to be sad
Yeah
"Also, you are being watched"
He's asleep
"No, I mean that"
What?
It's Lin's smartphone
It's out of the box
What's this?
This is being broadcast online
"There should be some people watching, including Lin's younger sister"
Is that a joke?
I'm serious
Which website?
"Hey, Bon?"
Which website?
So many choices.
It's not even practice and that one there is doing laps.
Isn't she pushing herself hard enough?
Remember when I pushed you?
It was just upstairs in the music room.
"Yes, I remember."
Do you remember the music you made?
[Piano playing]
It was perfect.
It made you perfect.
She can be perfect.
She shouldn't have to be.
[Gasps]
How long ago?
She was seen heading toward the pool about five minutes ago.
Where is it?
Just around the corner.
He can't get you now.
You're safe.
Open them up.
I can't. they lock from the inside.
That area is shelter in place.
Get around the corner.
Get around the corner!
There's something else about me that you should probably know.
[Groaning]
[Metallic clatter]
James:
There you are.
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Come on.
Just breathe.
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
I never imagined it could be you!
With age a person's reflexes slow down
Don't blame yourself.
It's said...
"T o err is human, and you're not even human!"
How's that?
Good?
Who is Jin Tianyun to you?
We share a complex relationship
It's now close to the end
Let's forget all that meaningless talk!
Come!
Is it Gao Jian?
What do you call that stance?
Good!
Very good!
Stop!
"Gao Jian, will you ever obey your elders?"
Y es!
Please teach us the stances... which you used to kill that old fart
Don't you fear betraying your own school?
Of course not.
"There's only me, you and him"
"That's right, you can teach us step by step"
Nobody will know!
That's right!
Okay!
"- Good morning, sweetheart."
- Hi.
Still in love with that coat?
What coat?
- Our guests arrive today.
- precisely.
You blockhead!
"These are the great geniuses of our time, gathered together in our home!"
They are a gang of parasites.
"After a few days in their company, I expect you'II come to your senses."
You'II humiliate me if you don't receive them.
charles!
You don't want me to be a success!
Gustav?
Gustav!
Attach little bags of seed to the branches.
I want thousands of birds singing when they come up the avenue.
darling?
You're not dressed properly.
Go and put on your pink waistcoat.
- (gunshot)
- Oh!
That murderer!
There won't be a bird left in the sky!
welcome!
Yes.
"Come on, HeIene."
welcome!
"In my house, you are the nobility."
The nobility of genius.
Madame Sand!
- hello.
How was your trip?
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
What?
"Dreaming about him like that,"
It's got to mean something.
What are you talking about?
"(karen:)come on, two nights in a row?"
Dreams are our subconscious working out
"What we can't, or won't, awake."
So mom used to tell me.
The last time we saw da veiga
He was chasing us through the jungle with a pistol.
What's to work out?
"(karen:)you're not sure he survived,"
Are you?
"(syd:)nigel, run!"
[struggling]
[explosion]
"(nigel:)syd, syd."
(karen:)are you okay?
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Um...
Did you set up our first meeting?
"Yeah, gareth watson,"
The druid expert
At bristol polytechnic.
He sent this fax confirming.
Meet him in his office.
[âª]
You're not really taking any of her
"Pop psychology mumbo jumbo to heart, are you?"
"Keep the change, thanks."
"I must admit,"
We're still a little unclear
You can't possibly be.
Yes.
The new owner of the Standish Tavern.
Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures.
Foreclosure?
You don't have to thank me.
I knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment.
I just dropped by to make final arrangements.
I can't leave without ensuring that my interests...
... arelookedafter by someone I can trust.
"Oh, no."
Never.
I will never work for you.
"Fine, if that's your attitude."
I'll find another bartender.
Bartender?
Then who's the manager?
I came. I saw. I conquered.
Wait.
Just tell me one thing.
Why?
Why here?
Why me?
"Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son."
We're business people.
And we're the best at what we do.
Don't ever forget that.
"Yes, indeed."
Previously on Vanished...
Jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
Good.
- Sit up for me.
Tonight you will face your final test.
- Mr. Porter.
- Mr. Avery.
- I took a look at it.
- And?
- It's chockfull of laudanum and what I think is Indian root.
And it appears to have trace amounts... of aconite.
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.
Wolf's bane.
"A poison, Mr. Porter."
"Not enough to kill you, but certainly enough to have rather unpleasant effects... on your mind."
- Congratulations.
You found us.
One final test... for your commitment.
Who do you see?
- Margaret.
- And why do you think she's here?
"- She whispered lies into my mind, sowed doubts within me."
She tried to turn me against you.
"- No, Isabel."
- She must be punished.
- Please.
- You will be my star.
Cleanse her with the lash.
Her screams will be her sacrament of reconciliation.
"- Isabel, please!"
Please!
Help me!
Please help!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Look at her
"Pablo, my god Pablito"
And what is this?
A surprise - yes?
This is Angela
- Hello
But what is it?
"A surprise, you'll see it inside"
He used to write every month but now it's been over a year
Without any news from him
Did you marry?
Don't tell me you got married without noticing me
Not until we have a flat
Catalina
- Hello son
Hello Angela
Is this you as a baby?
Very cute
Do you like moscatel?
"Yes, she likes it"
But don't serve us anything we're leaving right away
"Yes, I like it"
The police has been looking for you
When?
Like 20 days ago
"Is that true, grandma?"
"yes, like 20 days ago or so"
But you're not robbing again are you?
"No way, that's just police routine"
"No, sir, it's from that solar system ahead."
Any interference?
Resistance?
"No, sir, just scanning beams."
It's on an unusual wavelength.
Mr. Spock?
It would appear someone is curious about us.
"Mr. Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
"Yes, sir."
"We're closing, sir."
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
"There's no hostility, sir."
"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, just increasing in intensity."
Steady.
Regular.
"It's growing stronger, sir."
- Captain!
"- Yes, what is it?"
"The alien, it's slowing down."
"Warp 5, 4, 2."
"It's going sublight, sir."
Sir...
- It stopped dead in space.
- He may be turning to fight.
"No, sir."
They're just dead out there.
Are you sure?
"Yes, sir."
Unmoving.
Then we've got him.
Go to red alert.
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
What did you say?
!
Our squadrons are all assembled...
Huh?
Then what squadrons are those?
Did His Majesty send reinforcements?
Sion said he was putting me in charge of this!
There's no way he'd do that!
- Then...
- Don't tell me...
It's him?
That's impossible!
Crimson Fingered Claugh would ignore hostages and attack?
What do we do?
"If we lose after taking people hostage, we'll be executed!"
"No, we haven't lost yet..."
Let's kill the hostages.
I get it.
Roland doesn't think we're serious!
If we kill a hostage...
- Cease this!
- But...
You've all done well.
But this is it.
Let us release the hostages.
"But, Princess..."
I shall do all I can.
With my life alone!
You must not!
I cannot allow the Princess to die alone...
"I, too..."
"I shall accompany you, Princess!"
I guess you never leave here.
These savages and cowards only hunt the weak.
"Noah admits, 're dead meat."
"No, we are emperor penguins."
-With pride.
We looked into the eyes of the hungry but not surrender.
Even surrounded by walls of ice will not be defeated!
"That's how you talk, Noah!"
"We are courage, we are brave."
We are the glorious Empress nation.
"Erik, stay low."
-Mano?
-They are good.
"Gloria, behind you!"
"Get someone its size, coward."
"Do not worry, Princess."
I'll get you first.
While chilled before they become hard and rotten.
Boadicea.
This is my daughter!
What smart!
"The union of nations, This is what solidarity is."
"Well, now what?"
"Now, they managed a stay of execution."
Who are you?
-A idiot.
Thank you.
"Bo, you got it."
"Hello friends, you came."
Sure we have come.
Told Us.
-Where is Ramon?
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming
The most powerful man in the world.
"Ids, please."
Take a powder.
[laughing]
Tony.
Those are the outer security scanners.
Put them out of commission Permanently.
[static]
The scanning systems are malfunctioning.
"All right, let's run a maintenance check."
"Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right."
- Where to?
"- Andy's place, know it?"
"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.
Second and third?
- [man] fourth and market.
- That one.
- Hop in.
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you... [grunts]
- Don't worry.
- [tires screech]
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
[Alfred bleats]
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
- [Alfred bleats] - it has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
- What do you think?
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Come away
# All those years at the back of the queue
# Don't seem real
# All those dreams that were never on view
# We'll reveal
# All we felt that we didn't deserve
# Hand in hand we can summon the nerve
# To feel love
# And give love
# Till those dreams
# Come true
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Ah... #
Can I borrow your phone.
I have to make a call.
"Shit, someone's coming."
"Shit, they're shooting."
No ...
Henning ...
What are you ...
Henning?
Do not tell anyone.
"I'm not gay, you know?"
You heard something that seemed shots?
"No, not really."
I could not hear anything with the helmet.
We were wondering if Henning had not killed.
Four members of Ferrymen were murdered tonight.
"One of them was my informant,"
- Nothing?
The very time when you should have.
We call that dumb insolence.
"Bring the lamp closer, carpenter."
- There is a trace of worm.
- I thought you should know.
Nothing a little whitewash won't cure.
It might make its way to the midshipmen's berth.
You should look.
If you think it important.
Somebody being taught his manners?
"Overdoing it, isn't he?"
- That will do.
"- Aye, sir."
"All right, get up."
- What is he being punished for?
- Cutting his initials on the table.
- Where is this trouble you mentioned?
- Chapman!
All I see is a patch of uncoated timber.
Is that all?
"I thought you should see, sir."
- The wind's freshening.
- Why have you reversed my orders?
- Sir?
- I wanted the gallants set.
- But I find nothing.
- I judged...
"You judged, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
You judged?
- It's good seamanship.
- You're impertinent.
RB is very confident this time.
It's RB's habit to tell tall tales.
You should never underestimate your competitor.
Right?
I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order.
For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations..
..signs the next 10 years' agreement only with our company.
"Don't worry, sir."
We will try our best.
Not try.
Results.
Definitely.
You are working so hard.
It's very late.
Go to sleep.
Coming.
I will just finish this and come.
Okay?
Hey.
- Hey.
I will see you.
- Yeah.
The designs.
What is this?
Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well?
But have a look..
If our company starts working on the sketches made by you..
..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got.
Unbelievable!
Hey.
- Hey.
What happened?
"There's a podium, and has everything"
"Be careful, these stairs are no good"
"Open the door, Uncle Kwai"
Uncle Kwai
Coming
You are here
"Come in lt's so dark, why don't you turn on the light?"
I've got used to it
What?
You want to save money?
I can see without the light
"Don't tease me, sit..."
Sit...
This place is too small
You should sit here
Sit
This is...
Miss Man
Uncle Kwai
Uncle Kwai
"Please stay for dinner I don't have much to offer, but it's easy I'll buy some food from downstairs"
Good
"Uncle Kwai, no need to stand on ceremonies"
"Miss Man, how old are you?"
Twenty two
Have you got any brothers and sisters?
Four
Are they all in the Mainland?
Yes
You have great responsibilities
"Yes, come..."
"Let me tell you, she..."
"Linking, sir."
"Full-power acceleration from orbit, Mr. Scott."
"Full power, sir."
"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment,"
Mr. Sulu.
"Standing by to warp, sir."
Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command?
Not yet.
They may trace our beam.
Wait until we're well out of range.
"Can we know his range, Captain?"
We can take an educated guess-- at the point we entered their solar system.
Still no sign of pursuit.
"Instruments clear, sir."
Good.
May I take a moment to change?
"Yes, I think you might."
Turn in your glass slippers.
The ball is over.
"Gladly, Captain."
Hard to believe that it ever happened.
"Captain, we're about to warp."
Large body ahead.
Collision course.
"Hard to port, Mr. Sulu."
"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
Gothos!
Have we been going in circles?
No.
All instruments show on-course.
Gothos again.
Hard over.
"We stand in the shadows,"
"Protected by darkness,"
Hidden from light.
"So is it always,"
So shall it be.
Who comes before the gural nataz?
Stand and be recognized.
"Can we do without this, rennes?"
I've had a very bad day.
We're all anxious
"To hear from you, fabrice."
Maybe the great da veiga would like
To show his humiliation in private.
Rachel!
"You can't protect him forever, rennes."
Silence!
I bring bad news.
My courier has died from the wounds
He received fighting with the two thieves.
Then where are they now?
They're being tracked according
To standard protocol.
Where is the case?
Why haven't you sent a team
To cancel fox and bailey?
"I'm seeing to it, personally."
"Very good, fabrice."
But this council will not
Tolerate another failure.
I understand.
"So it is spoken,"
So shall it be.
Wait
What should I do?
Make yourself useful
Help those who need it
How?
You can ease their consciences
That's a tremendous power
We can't keep him for long
The generator is running low.
We have to evacuate
is he dead?
What do you think?
Did you shoot him?
Yeah
Good work
Right in the heart.
He died instantly
Tell me ifyou find anything odd
Like?
I don't know.
Just odd
"Can you go to your room, please?"
Go to your room
- Is it about the ghost?
"- Go to your room, please"
- The ghost has gone
- Where to?
Back where he came from
How do you know he won't come back?
Because now he knows we don't need him
The police will come and ask you questions
They will want to know if you knew the ghost
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved,"
Doesn't seem to believe in you.
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
[knob squeaks] [gas hissing]
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
[grunting] get back!
[goat bleats]
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
[goat bleats]
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
[gas continues to hiss]
"Now, Tony, those wine casks..."
Stack them...
Neatly.
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
- [goat bleats] - [gas hisses]
"[muscles] hey, got any more clues?"
No.
"- First, you can't drive."
- Why not?
You can't drive your car.
Let him get some fresh air.
You're so pretty.
The princess on the pea.
Little mouse.
But you want to sleep.
I can see how tired you are.
Yes my love.
Lullaby and goodnight
With roses bedight
With lilies o'er spread ls baby's wee bed
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
- Do you recognize that sound?
"- Yes, mistress."
You know how much I love to pull you up on your balls.
"Oh yes, mistress."
- Ease it a little?
"- As you wish, mistress."
Or do you beg me to pull harder?
"Harder, please, mistress."
- I can't hear your.
"- Harder, please, mistress."
- And?
"- Please, mistress."
That's better.
- After all.
"- Thank you, mistress."
"Forgive me, I don't stock new labels or small labels"
KK-Mix burnt out four years ago.
"And what an album, ""What's Life?"""
These songs don't sell.
And I won't annoy Mr Shekhar
Mr Om!
You...?
Hello...
You don't recognise me?
I remember you very well
Can I ever forget a pirate?
- That's just as well
"Market news is, no one's willing to distribute your label with KK-Mix"
But I can sell
"Until now, you only trusted gentlemen"
"For once, try out a scoundrel"
"I will, if you stop pirating music"
Stipulating terms?
Even in distress?
That makes me feel like agreeing
"Okay, God be my witness."
No more piracy
How are you Papa?
Fine
Shopping?
Not really
Where's Jai?
At work
In the junkyard?
Are you cooking?
Just trying
Just look at the way she looks.
"The trouble is, officially the problem doesn't exist."
-
- What does one do?
-
- One acquires a frat detector.
Something that burns on a low light.
A little yellow flame which turns green the moment the frats appear.
That's one.
"There, madam."
I'll open the door for you.
Thank you!
"Do call again for frat oil, won't you?"
"""Quaint""?"
"What does she mean, ""quaint""?"
I'll give her qu--quaint!
"This may be old--fashioned, but it's functional."
-
- This here is an annexe to my wallet.
-
- How did you sell them lamps?
"Don't worry about that, Granville."
That's too advanced for you.
-
"- Oh, my God, what's that?"
-
"- Oh, me horse collapsed."
I'm not surprised!
"Oh, dear."
Hardly the thing for a quiet evening out with the one you love.
-
- What?
It's not so loud.
Come over
Top up Ah Cheung's stakes

You're so weak
Do you need your mother to pamper you?
"Damn you, what the hell do you know?"
Don't come over
Watch him for me
"What do I know, I placed a big bet on you"
Stop...
Can you fight?
If you can go up and fight
Right...
Why not?
Can I bet on myself?
Of course
"You'll be the red side, the odd is one to five"
"Alright, I'll bet on myself"
Bet on me...
"I'll surely win, bet on me"
All for red
Bet on red...it's sure win
Bet on red
You don't know?
He doesn't know.
Well!
"But surely,"
This is very important evidence.
"I mean, mrs."
Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve
"Of her perpetrator, right?"
"All right, tell me, where is it?"
Where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably
At the crime scene?
We've been unable to locate it.
It disappeared...
"Just poof, hmm?"
"I mean, evidence that could prove"
That someone other than my client
Murdered victoria enright.
Yes.
So you wouldn't mind if they searched your house
"For that cuff link, would you?"
You're not gonna find it there.
Why?
Did you hide it somewhere else?
That's not what I meant.
No.
What you meant...
"Was to be judge and jury,"
Hiding evidence that would vindicate my client.
And you know what?
You very nearly succeeded.
Thank you.
So...

"He knows, doctor."
He has reasoned it out.
Yes.
- Yes.
"- What is it, Spock?"
"An invention, doctor."
"First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal."
What's he doing?
"Diamonds, the hardest known substance."
"Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles."
What force?
"Recall your basic chemistry, doctor."
- Gunpowder.
"- Captain, let us be reasonable."
You have lost.
Admit it to yourself.
Stop running.
Coal.
Can he do it?
"If he has the time, doctor."
If he has the time.
No.
"No, I won't kill you."
Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.
"No, I won't kill him!"
Do you hear?
You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else.
You're a Metron?
"Does my appearance surprise you, captain?"
Didn't mean much
We were hungry but we could not be fed
Radio blasting
Silly little love songs
We only listened for the beat
Taking our chances
Out there on the mean streets
Hiding in the shadows from the heat
From the heat
We weren't lovers
Just brave strangers
As we fought and we tumbled through the night
We were players
Not arrangers
And we jammed till the dawn's early light
Swimming in the big lake
Taking it easy
Taking any comfort we could find
Didn't need the real truth
Didn't need the meaning
Straight ahead ignoring every sign
Every sign

Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."

"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.

"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:
"I feel like Falling in love and touch me over here, touch over there."
Ju:
Exactly.
That's the feeling.
So 1st place Infinite- Destiny!
Ju:
"In our MV Reaction, when I saw the video and listen to this song, I..."
Jana:
Fell in love.
Ju:
I did.
"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.
"I'm now 5% Inspirit, because I'm still a V.I.P , Shawol..."
Jana:
Is that for real?
Ju:
I said 5%!
A bit in my heart!
Jana:

"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."
( dials phones )
Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Who is this?
North Shore Clinic.
"Uh, this is the police."
"Will you check something for me, please?"
I'd like to know if you've given a smallpox vaccination to a Gus Priamos recently.
"Uh, Priamos."
P-R-I-A-M-O-S.
This morning?
The General is your father?
"Yes, your future fatherinlaw."
"Let's go, your uncle is eager to see you."
Your Royal Highness.
No formality.
Kneel.
Arise.
"Thank you, your Highness."
You're the Emperor?
I'm the Emperor of Zhennan.
And you're his uncle?
He's told me that... he's worried about you being angry at him.
"So please don't beat him, okay?"
"Miss Mu is very honest, and interesting."
I was going to punish him with the cane.
"But since you've pleaded for him, then it's forgotten."
Yu.
Hurry and thank Miss Mu.
Yes.
"Thank you for your plea, Miss Mu."
Time for your family reunion?
Yes.
"Goodbye, your Highness."
"Mother, let me drink to you."
I can't drink.
And you know that.
"Mother, this calls for a celebration,"
"Come on, Miss Mu toast to you too."
"Come on, let's have a drink."
We're a family from now on.
"Baifeng, have a sip."
"""The woman has a red mole on her left wrist."
"Can you pass me a spoon, soul roll brother never would?"
"Lights up, please."
"Come on, now."
"Damn, directorio."
What it do?
You must be on them red devils.
Y'all know what a red devil is?
"I'm not going to tell you, either."
"But I know my uncle used to take them, then fall asleep at the light."
BETH HOYT:
All right.
"Hi, guy guys."
"Man, um, here, we, this is, need these props."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, thank you."
BETH HOYT:
"These aren't full, though."
"So you guys, what we're doing, we've got some [INAUDlBLE]."
I'll give you this one.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Cheers.
BETH HOYT:
Not that it matters if you have.
"OK, we're here with [INAUDlBLE] ""Real Housewives of New York City"" critic Julia Klausner, and rock star Ted Leo."
"Ted, have you ever watched ""Real Housewives?"""
TED LEO:
I have.
BETH HOYT:
"Oh, good."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You went to high--
"You went to high school with Camille Grammer, didn't you?"
She can carry the whole show.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
*Missing school fund discovered.* *After a recent probe...*
"Now, there's our anchor."
"Hi, Russ."
(boy) Out of the way.
Quit shoving!
Editorial!
"Yes, the Patman does it again."
"What's it feel like to be a loser, Egg-wad?"
There's no justice!
"Yes, I got anchor!"
Yes!
I got the Fashion Forecast.
Taste finally arrives at Sweet Valley High.
(girl) I know.
She's gonna be great.
"(boy) Oh, well..."
*(boy #2)* OK...
"So, Russ, looks like we'll be working some long hours together."
It'll be my pleasure.
"Well, that's a start."
Jessica and Lila got on and I didn't?
There must be some mistake.
Maybe you should talk to Mr. Collins.
"OK, news team, come get your story assignments."
Go on.
I will.
Go get your assignment.
I'll be fine.
"You did an exceptional job, Jessica."
Go!
Father.
"Canglong, are you an animal?"
Lingerh.
Mother.
Shut up.
"If I get angry,"
I'll eat up all your hearts.
Canglong.
We're guests here.
How could you be so rude to Miss Zhong?
Down.
Wake up.
Where are we?
Caught by the Yellow Robe Man and brought here.
Right.
"You've sucked up the Red Python's blood, and you're endowed with ""Red Dragon Soul""."
Climb up and look around.
"Maybe you can break the top, and we can escape."
I'll try.
The cover is very strong.
I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
Do you remember what he looked like?
About 35.
Dark.
Nice-looking.
"Uh, thanks."
Thanks very much.
A boat would be too slow.
Check out the airlines.
Right.
One of them has a booking for Gus Priamos.
Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.
We've got no pictures of Priamos.
You've got pictures of Kimble.
( dramatic theme playing )
I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.
What do you care?
"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."
And he's going to be late.
And you're on your way to Greece.
You're on your way to Greece.
Yeah.
But he thinks it's you.
"Hey, Johnny."
We're here.
"You know what to do, Gus."
You betcha.
( tense theme playing )
That's not it!
Don't you know me?
In that extremely degraded place!
Ah!
I don't know.
I feel leery!
I feel leery!
Hey!
Doesn't my body smell?
Huh?
"Hey, Baek Go Dong!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Try to smell it."
"Ah, hyung-nim!"
Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim
left for the practice room.
He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Donatacci?
TED LEO:
Yeah.
Donatacci.
That's right.
BETH HOYT:
"OK, you guys."
I've watched plenty myself.
"One thing I've learned, I mean, you guys can back me up on this is that bitches be crazy, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
In general.
BETH HOYT:
Yep.
"So we're going to play in general, Bitches Be Crazy."
"OK, I'm going to give you guys a quote from either ""Real"
"Housewives of New York City"" ""Girl, Interrupted,"" the"
Winona Ryder movie about women in an insane asylum.
You have to guess which crazy bitch said what.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
BETH HOYT:
"Julia and Ted, you use your paddle to show us which one you think the quote is from."
"And you get a point for each one you get correct, and you drinks for each one you get wrong."
I'm just going to be drinking throughout.
TED LEO:
OK.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That makes me more comfortable.
BETH HOYT:
That's what we're looking for.
OK.
Type in a new card for Elizabeth.
"You got it. *the superintendent of schools,*"
*this money* *will now be redirected*
*to Sweet Valley High* *Activities Committee...*
Great.
"You're up next, Bruce."
(mutters) Bruce.
And that's all the news you need to know.
"Till next time, Sweet Valley."
"And now, with his... unique take on Sweet Valley,"
Bruce Patman.
"Thank you, Jess..."
"*I mean, Elizabeth.*"
Where's his card?
It's coming right up.
"*Hello, fellow Gladiators.*"
"*And as if you didn't know,* *I'm Bruce Patman,*"
*and this is* *the Patman perspective...*
(giggling)
I'm really sorry.
This has to be done.
What did Collins say?
I have to talk to the principal.
Can't say you don't deserve it.
"Hey, nice move back there."
You really got me.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?"
I'm impressed.
You're a nightmare.
*But I say there's nothing wrong* *with having money.* (Patty) Winston!
*I love the way money feels.* *I love the way money smells.*
I love what money does for me.
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.
My goal is to fall unconscious six times and be a Robocop!
Ouch!
That really hurts!
A Robocop!
You're Robocop!
"Dad, Dal-rae's killing your son!"
Dal-rae?
"He deserved it, right?"
Of course.
Take her away Young-hoon!
Don't come back here again!
How can he be so filthy!
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
[whimsical music]
man:
Whoo!
[boy crying]
[cheers and applause]
[helicopter whirring]

man:
Do the jerk.
Please do the jerk.
"By the end, I'm gonna try to get the commander to do the jerk. man #2:"
Aah! man:
Why you always got to stick your tongue out?
Punch Eason in the face right now. man #3:
"Oh, my God! man:"
That's the Rebel Alliance.
And there's the Empire.
Masood:
Hi.
This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
- Let's break up.
"-Why, Sook-hyun?"
-We've made it this far.
Just...
- This card is maxed out.
Find a better woman.
Can you put these back on the shelves?
Sook-hyun!
There's no better woman for me.
Don't do this...
Cut it out and get lost!
I'm sorry
Attention please.
"Guardians for patient Kwak, please come to the ER."
Attention please.
"Guardians for patient Kwak, please come to the ER."
Will you go in and see Mom?
Don't worry.
They said she's fine.
SMS from Lee Jin Woo
Meet me at the Sky Lounge today.
"Hello, Hello."
"Jin-woo, if you're off duty, then act like it."
Forget this and go start a fire in your girlfriend's heart
Okay?
See you.
"Hey, be careful!"
Where is it?
Please let me find it.
The gap in performance at elementary schools is rising.
"Now, today's weather forecast."
"Due to the high atmospheric pressure from the southwest, the heat wave..."
What are you doing?
BETH HOYT:
I am demonstrating some different ways to sit.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
"Reporter Han, search the portals more."
Reporter Song!
"Reporter Song, check if anything has come up in the gallery."
Yes &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;[ in French ]
Did you understand?
"If I don't give orders at the office, nothing works here."
Excuse me.
This is a non-smoking section.
Yes.
What?
What?
What!!!
Why?
Why?
What is this?  &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take 1's Won Kang Hwi is Gay...
"What to do, Ga Ryeong?"
Yes.
Hello?
Hello.
"No, he isn't here."
"I'm sorry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
What's this?
Is the broadcast still not over?
It looks like I have to leave even without saying bye.
"What time is the flight? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Announcement. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Boarding Korean Air TK009,  which was scheduled to leave at 13:50, will be delayed due to sudden problems with the plane."
What?
Why problems with the plane?
Omo!
Omo!
What is this about Won Kang Hwi?
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.
None
Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."

Huh?

"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
Whoa.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That's a funny combination.
TED LEO:
"I know, I know John would jerk me off."
"We know this is a thing, so."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
[INAUDlBLE].
BETH HOYT:
Tom might do it no hands style.
I feel like Tom would be like-- or something would happen.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"He would give you a reverse happy ending, remember?"
"He was like, oh, this masseuse, masseurs were like, accusing him of first of all, coining the term reverse happy ending."
"Which doesn't, it didn't exist until he came along with it."
TED LEO:
"I love imagining that in like, a Vinny Barbarino voice, that he'd be like, come on, man."
I'll jerk you off.
That's good.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"I would marry him because he would never touch me, and I could do what I wanted to do."
BETH HOYT:
Right.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"I would uh, kill Charlie Sheen, and uh, fuck Tom Cruise."
Why not?
TED LEO:
Sure.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
"You'd be into it, even though--"
BETH HOYT:
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.
"Sir, I came for visit."
"Hi Dal-rae, welcome!"
"Hey, what's up?"
This is Ji-hwan's dad.
"I'm MOON Young-hoon, Ji-hwan's classmate."
"Ah, so you're Young-hoon..."
"Sir, bought some soju and squid for you."
How many?
The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?
"No sir, not really."
You're cringing.

- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
Jackie!
My dog has bitten me.
My dog has bitten me.
Yes!
"- Sir, Pasha murdered two men and escaped."
What?
Pasha!
- Pasha escaped?
Joseph!
"- Yes, man."
Don't worry.
We've come to receive you.
Now you'll reach Mr. Daver in Singapore.
Your fake passport is ready.
"I'd suggest, it's not good to delay Radha's marriage now."
But there should be a nice match for her.
What about Mr. Prem Prakash's son?
He's little close in our relations.
But the boy is really nice.
"Even if we keep refusing the alliances, Jackie... ...will not come out of the jail for 2 years."
And it's difficult for us to let Radha... ...remain unmarried for 2 more years.
Its an absolutely lost case.
Gone.
"Oh, yes."
I forgot.
Your old friend has sent a letter.
From Singapore.
- Singapore?
He's Mr. Jimmy Thapa.
"Oh, Jimmy!"
He was my college friend.
Last year he was stuck with some custom problem... ...and I had helped him solve it.
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
They're Granddad's teeth.
Granddad's teeth.
"So, the sex gods are twins."
- C'est magnifique.
- Marvy.
- But they're not identical.
"- Obviously, Jas."
They're two years above us.
Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.
London!
I knew they were cosmopolitan.
Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.
You lot are so sweet.
I got mostly eights for everything.
"- So did I. - Me, too."
"Hey, who gave me a four for my nose?"
And look.
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?
- All girls here can.
- Can you show me?
- All right.
- Can you teach me?
"I can teach you something, too."
- Want me to teach you telepathy?
- What now?
"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!
- Try to make him do stuff.
- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.
- Dolt.
"- I swear, that wasn't me."
He did that on his own.
- There's something in there!
- Smells like a wolf.
Or a badger.
- Have you ever smelled a badger?
- A hundred times!
Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.
Master!
Said you gotta do both.
A National is only two weeks away and you're 3 kg over.
Pick up the speed!
Another weight loss?
Don't get me started.
Go get me some water.
Ji-hwan...
"You're losing weight to avoid facing Young-hoon, right?"
Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.
Gave me one cigarette.
"Sir, cigarette."
"Hey, why are you thundering like that?"
Could you not remember me all these days?
"Anyway, now that you came, stay here for some time."
The both of us can play together.
"Ah, semi-retired."
"You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
One can never be...
Too careful.
"Oh, um, hey, um."
Sorry.
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna go."
"Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
"Elena, I am..."
I'm sorry.
"Please, it... it's ok."
"Ah, it's not ok, Elena."
"I mean, this is not even my place."
It's... it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family...
It's your family's place.
"The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too."
"We needed you, and..."
And you stayed.
Sp thank you for that.
I'm a guy from Busan.
I'm doing as I please.
"Then someday, won't Ha Ni realize the potential Bong Joon Gu has?"
When are the So Pal Bak noodles coming out?
Oh!
Hi!
Did you get home safely?
Yesterday?
"Ah yes, of course!"
I did get home safely.
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.
"But, it seems like you did worry about me."
"Anyways, it was fun."
It was like we were shooting a movie.
"""Gangsters and Hae Rin"""
I'm glad that you got home safely.
Let's go inside.
Look at this.
"Wonderful perfection, a goddess."
You sure did take a lot of pictures.
"Wow, look at this."
"She looks pretty, right?"
"So, what happened yesterday?"
"You did have a date, right?"
What date?
We just ate and left right after.
"Ah, I should have paid for the food."
"Ah, what is that?!"
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!
You should have confessed.
Confession...
I did plan on doing it.
Why are you doing this?
Damn it!...
Damn it!...Damn it!
Damn ..
"Dalyan, I don't know how my son is."
Maybe he's dying.
I have to look into Mahir's eyes and ask for forgiveness...
Don't deprive me of this!
Don't deprive me of this!
"Thank you, my brother."
Come on.
Now stab me...
Then go to bed.
They will find me alone. as i don't want to bring any trouble to you.
"Hello, Kemal."
Why didn't you tell me that Mahir got shot?
I called you but you weren't there.
And how is he now?
"He's in the hospital, unconscious."
Who did it?
Did they arrest anyone?
No Abi.
No one got arrested.
"Ok, Ok."
Look Kibrit.
How much do you make out of rooster fights?
Is it enough?
I always find a way to make money.
"I should find a new way for you to make money, Kibrit."
You're right.
But all the ways are taken.
It's a heavy traffic.
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."
- Go on read it.
- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."
"Please, if you wand to get well, my dear."
I am sorry.
I know I upset you so much.
I am sorry.
"- It's okay, canım."
- I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay.
Okay.
Barış did what is expected from him.
"When he felt cornered, he pulled a victim out of his hat."
- How did you know I'd be here?
- Your assistant told me.
"Melda, we need to talk."
"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.
- Go - I won't go..
What are you are going to do?
Narin..
Narin...
Narin???
"You went to Serdar, didn't you Narin??"
I know you went to Serdar!
"You won't sit at home, waiting for me!"
"What is there that you can't find here, I don't know!!!"
Good evening.
- Welcome...
- Thank you
Hello?
"Where are you, Narin?"
It is late.
I should go.
Let me drop you off.
"No, don't trouble yourself."
I can go by myself.
It is late.
It won't do to go by yourself this late.
"Go, my daughter."
"I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo."
"At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue..."
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!
When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!
"You're a bad man with no chance, you can't even touch me"
"I got four more years (two terms) in the White House, just trust me"
I hoped you saved your best rhymes for the second half
"Cause right now, I'm 47% through kicking your ass!"
[Mitt Romney]
"Whatever, that 40% thing got you real mad"
"What, did it remind you how many decent parents you had?"
[Barack Obama]
"Uh, look, I respect all religions, uh, but it might get crazy"
"If the White House has a first, second, and a third lady!"
[Mitt Romney]
Ha!
"Don't bring up wives, man!"
What are you doing?
You got hitched to the female version of Patrick Ewing!
[Barack Obama]
"Uhhhhhhh, let me be clear, uh, don't get it twisted"
We'll see how pretty your face is after my fist has kissed it
[Mitt Romney]
Ahhuuhhaa...You're a stuttering communist
[Barack Obama]
Oh yeah?
Well you're stupid
[Mitt Romney]
You're stupid!
[Barack Obama]
Nuh-uh!
[Mitt Romney]
EERRGGG!
[Barack Obama]
EEEERRRRR!
[Eagle]
I think.. you have gone mad.
"Go and find a big stone. okay, sir!"
Why are you all staring at me?
Go and search for a big stone! come on!
Hey!
Who are you?
"Aren""t you ashamed to steal! shoes thief! come on!"
Hey! shoes thief!
What is going on?
Beware if you touched our shoes!
I am sorry.
"I need stone, not shoes."
I need stone!
Why?
Whose skull do you want to break?
"I am not mad that I will break somebody""s skull!"
No need to give justifications!
I have heard about many thieves!
But today I am seeing a fashionable thief!
That too shoes thief!
"Ma""am, talk respectfully!"
"Maybe you don""t know who I am!"
You talk politely!
"lf you talked too much, I will hand you over to the police!"
What do guys nowadays think of themselves?
This is their business!
First BA.
"And when they don""t find a job, they start stealing shoes!"
Nab him!
Hand him over to the police!
Police!
Police!
Anthony Gonsalves.
Did I really make this?
I don't believe it.
I can't believe that I made this?
The way it has landed I am completely sure you've made it.
What did you say?
- That's why professor.. ..only you can tell me how I can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.
- You gave me.
"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"""I love you."""
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.
- I see.
Thrice.
'The first time..'
"'I love you, Kamla.'"
'I want to marry you.'
- There.
Have you buried the gold here?
"You will be buried here, sheikh."
Why was the bullet fired?
I think something is fishy!
Remember.. in front of me you had killed my mother.
"I won""t spare you, sheikh!"
"I won""t spare you!"
As per our information lran lnterpol had raided the place. sheikh Padar was killed.
And Tiger singh fled.
"lnformer Yasmin is in lran police""s custody."
Yasmin says that Tiger will surely go to Alaska to meet shebiro.

Where is the gold?
Gold?
- Gold!
He has the gold.
We will equally share the gold.
Now Tiger is going to come.
Take this.
"Lipstick bomb. open this, apply it and then close it."
Then put it in his pocket.
"He will die after one minute. okay, boss."
Hello!
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.
Sit over here.
"Stop playing around, dad."
Wait a sec Young-hoon.
Will be with you shortly.
"Thought you were hurt, look well to me."
My sincere apology for being well.
Are these even washed?
Should've never come here!
"Well, Ji-hwan says you will wash them again, for sure and told me to soak them and hang."
And those... socks need to be sewed.
I'll let you pass just for today.
Are these rags or socks?
Shit!
I guess you're a writer.
Yeah.
A novel.
"Oh, I see."
Why do you look at me like that?
Do I look that handsome to you?
"Yes, you're handsome."
Kissing my ass?
So young yet corrupted already!
Um...
Did you want to tell me something?
Have a seat.
Okay.
I consider Dal-rae like a daughter
How long have you been a couple?
It's been about three months.
You two can't be serious then.
Huh?
Are you close to Ji-hwan?
Again you taunted me!
Duty is duty!
Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town?
"Friend, this is a small town."
But many activities are carried out here!
I will explain to you when l am free.
I will leave now.
"Listen.. don""t forget your friend for the sake of your duty!"
"All the best! - see you! sir, he is chief lnspector of customs."
Diwan Dinanath.
"Mr. Dinanath, how are you, sir?"
Fine.
Thank you.
How are you?
Fine.
Thank you.
I have heard a lot about you from lG.
Thanks.
I was waiting for you only. - come.
I have to go for my duty.
And you have come from a long journey.
You must be tired.
Rest for now.
Have dinner with me in the evening.
And we will discuss the matter there.
"Thank you, sir."
I am lucky that I got the chance to have home made dinner.
Pleasure is mine.
- Thank you.
"Thank you so much. - see you tonight, Mr. Diwan!"
Bye!
Rao.
"Really, Jess, you should find a better class of guy, someone like Todd."
"He's dependable, trustworthy, loyal..."
That's not a boyfriend.
That's a Boy Scout.
News show?
"What's the scoop, Mr. Collins?"
The school's installing a new in-class video system.
"As of next week, Oracle goes broadcast."
Cool.
Lame.
What a great opportunity.
I'm signing up now.
Hello.
Can I help you?
You already have.
Russ Franklin.
I'm the video consultant for the news show.
"Oh, you're working on this?"
Mm-hmm.
"Jessica Wakefield,"
Sweet Valley's next news anchor.
Mind if I check out some of your... equipment?
"Film major at Valley College, huh?"
Creative men really turn me on.
Must be a really tough program.
"Yeah, it's... murder."
We have to watch five movies a day.
They actually expect us to pay attention.
Brutal.
This is the nerve center of our operation.
From here I can hook in and put your face in every classroom in the school.
Really?
Tha-Tha-Tha-- That would be-- That would be great sometime.
- How about tomorrow ?
"- Well, I have ballet practice."
Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards ?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it ?
"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
"Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you."
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.
Fuck me !
There's gonna be an Eastern European chick naked in your house.
And you're not gonna do anything about that ?
Fine.
I feel all right.
( ferry whistle blows )
We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
2307.5 times one... is just that!
2307.5 times one!
Ah.. is there anyone here? heeeeeelp!
"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.
10.
- 13.
10.
- 11.
"10, that's it."
10.
A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
You took a lot of risk for us till now.
You just go.
How can we leave you like that?
"Yes, we will also come with you."
You go from here.
- Listen to me.
They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."
Why dont you pick up the cell?
- It is your cell phone.
What?
My phone?
Hello?
Who is it?
I am unable to listen.
"Tayaru, is that you?"
We are coming.
He calls himself God.
I can see him.
He can see you.
"My name's Krishna, your new neighbour."
Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.
- Advice.
Anyone who thinks of me.
Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.
But...l always get there on time.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.
"Ever since Sylvester picked up those two letters, ...bad things take place one after the other."
Weird things that no one can explain!
They just happen...
Click!
Just like that.
Sylvester
"Moon, it's your pager."
"I've dehited $3,000 into your account."
"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!
I don't live here!
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?
Sync and corrected by Rafael UPD www.addic7ed.com/
Please help us!
Help us!
I don't want to die!
Stop!
"Young Master, why are you here again?"
"It will make things difficult for us, if it's said that such a thing happened on our ship."
Stop this immediately.
I had no intention of throwing them in either.
I just wanted to see someone's reaction.
What a waste.
You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.
Now it's Yongmun?
What if he recognizes Gil Dong?
This is getting complicated.
Still there's not too many of them to fight.
Go Add.
Don't you feel anything?
You've been quiet.
Scared?
"Come on, Add."
Mom.
I miss you.
I want to see you at the cemetery next time.
"Hey, why did you stop?"
Did you see a ghost?
"No, I'll take Dow to her mom's cemetery."
Huh?
You're going to a cemetery?
We've just escaped from one.
And we're going to a ghost city.
Are you crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you climb up?
"Aren""t you ashamed?"
Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? show me your baskets!
Hey!
You want to seize our baskets!
The basket contains fishes and not gold!
I know you all very well!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
"What are you doing? constable, what are you doing?"
Are you mad?
Yes!
You have spoiled the fishes!
Now who will buy these fishes?
"Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. ..to check whether gold is hidden in it or not!"
Why are you after our fishes?
Go and check the fishes in the oceans!
Fine!
I am leaving!
I am leaving!
"Why are you screaming? seema, why are you running away from me?"
My friends have told me so many things about you.. ..that now I am afraid of you.

And what about my money?

I had told you to bring gold and not fish!
"Papa, you can""t eat gold!"
You can eat fish!
"And Pryor, the man I really wanted was you."
That's very flattering.
Maybe.
"But unless you want him to die in your place, you better get that money."
"Well, I'll-- I'll have to think about it."
"Well, don't you take long."
I'll call back and don't you call the police.
You're being watched.
Hello?
Hello?
Did you recognize that voice?
Was that anybody you knew?
"No, I don't think so."
Was that him again?
Yes.
He's got Jordan.
Apparently I was number one on his shopping list but he made a mistake.
"Are those the pictures, Mrs. Pryor?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, this one."
( dramatic theme playing )
You know this guy?
No.
I don't think so.
Do you?

"You communists spend half your lives trying to prove God doesn't exist and when things go wrong, you call his name."
But he won't hear you because you're on the wrong side.
"Dad, please don't hurt me."
I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.
You're just a subversive piece of shit.
We're here to educate you people.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
"Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor."
"Miss Calm Cat,"
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
"Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow."
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"""Seung Jo ah"" &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; How did I end up here? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date."
"JlN Dal-rae, from Youngbyun, Yaksan!"
"Dad, you named me, so don't forget it."
Okay?
"Dad, you're losing weight."
"Good morning! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's Ji-hwan, a friend from neighborhood.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was out exercising, brought these for you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stopped his mental age around ten.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How pitiful, so I play with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Dal-rae! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's Young-hoon, my boyfriend.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good looking, huh?"
"Master of Taekwondo as well.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Always finishing in 1st place.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Took some time, but finally found myself the one.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
Fine!
I am dead for you!
"But don""t instigate my son!"
Who are you to separate me from my son? son?
Whose son?
"A criminal""s son?"
"A smuggler""s son?"
Take your son!
I hate him! seema!
You can hate me as much as you want!
"But don""t abuse my son."
Nobody is born evil in this world.
"People""s circumstances make them evil."
"20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family."
You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. stop!
Think before you do anything!
I have thought about it!
"Let""s inform the police!"
How will we reach to the police? smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse!
Have you also joined hands with them?
You may think so.
Traitors!
"Today because of people like you.. ..the country""s state is bad!"
Patriot! sheela!
You! - shekhar!
What happened to you?
- Father!
Who has done this to you?
Traitors!
Raman has joined hands with the smugglers!
Today I saw him.. and he did this to me!
"I won""t spare him!"
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
I need to go.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Eom!
What is this money for?
Here is today's weather forecast.
Heavy clouds and showers are expected tonight.
How was it?
Was it okay?
Too slow.
It'll be night and raining by the time you finish.
"And smile, won't you?"
"Good, good."
Su-eun!
Let's do it again.
I can't hear you.
"Once more, please?"
I'm your only sister!
"So you're clumsy, aren't you?"
"You're a lousy artist, but your face is well-drawn."
I didn't know we had such a cutie in our park.
Oh?
This...
How did you know it was mine?
"Is there any other artist around here, dummy?"
It's all smudged.
Tell me it's a very important painting for you...
You could've just thrown it out.
But thanks anyway.
Damn!
You punk!
"I was going to be generous since you're cute, but..."
"Well, I'll let you off this time Today is your lucky day."
I am at home.
Welcome.
Thank you.
"Mustafa, this girl is very beautiful, too."
But...
There is pain in her eyes.
Have you burned this girl?
She burned you?
"No, I don't believe that..."
"These eyes have learned to get burned,  they don't know how to burn."
"These looks are not the ones that burn,  they are the ones that get burned."
Narin?!
I'm here...
"Narin, where are you?"
"This is my fate, Yasar..."
To look at Mustafa from a distance.
"I won't be able to be beside him until I die, but..."
I will always look at my husband from a distance...
Like this...
I will always look at my husband.
You haven't been eating...
They said so...
You should eat...
Think of your child...
Narin...
Where have you been?
"Where have you been, Narin?"
"I have been in the hell that you put me, Mustafa... (Singing in Kurdish)"
You are a rose
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
You are a rose
Do you know what lemons called in Warangal?
What are they called?
- They are called Lemons.
That is what is called extra speech.
Pour 2 litres.
- Ok.
"My boy, where is the club for playing cards?"
Search!
There is nothing you cannot find by searching.
I did not like your face.
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.
Is it sixty-eight?
I have sixty.
Keep the change.
Ah!
He gave 8 rupees less and asking me to keep the change?!
Ah!
What a son in law!
He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.
Leave the matter.
All these days she supported him.
Now you are doing that?
He left us at home with out any care and.. .. now we dont know in which club or .. ..under which tree he is playing cards.
I am here!
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
Why can't we do that?
Speak up
Can't we not hear it?
No， she must tell me why
My mammy said a man getting intimate with a girl before marriage may desert her some day
Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily
What now?
Go down for the wedding night
Okay
Go now
"Sister, now the 1st thing is to take a bath"
Hurry up
Why are you wearing a hat?
Higher
Open up， Mimi， the groom's here

"Go home, it's going to rain."
You'll get drenched.
It's an earthquake.
Swamiji Rain?
Rain?
- Rain?
My hand's paining.
I won't be able to write my exam tomorrow.
I'll slap you.
I'll make you hold the pen in your mouth and write your paper.
You're scolding him.
But what about you?
- What did I do?
What?
The festivities were left incomplete.
You've to admit that there's God.
You spread the rumour.. ..and immediately there was an earthquake.
- Remember.
- What earthquake?
Even the utensils didn't budge.
Papa.
I think they took your announcement too seriously.
This news just came in from parts of the country.. ..that the idol of Sri Krishna's eating butter.
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.
"Priest, offer the Lord some buttermilk."
"People are offering cheese, cottage-cheese.. ..butter, buttermilk to the idol of Krishna."
"- Oh, God!"
The rumour has spread so far.
"Please, eat it."
This is low-cholesterol cheese.
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.

Wait.

I'll never get reincarnated
Where's Robert?
I'm Robert.
Robert is me
Lisa， please help me so I may get reincarnated
Never

Don't! lf you touch me I may be sent down to hell
What?
Sorry， I can't help you
I'll find someone else then.
Bye
Never.
Get hold of him
Get hold of him
Get hold of him.
Don't let him get away
Follow him
Landal， are you all right?
It's all because of you
Had you yielded to me， he wouldn't have got you involved
I....
Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."
"- Your parents aren't here, are they?"
- No.
My hours are between 4:30 and 5:30 before they get back from work.
Any musical requests?
The right tune creates the right vibe.
Coldplay?
50 Cent?
Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."
We're going to do a standard one first.
"Wow, you're a natural."
- Really?
- Not too firm or toothy.
- That's very common with beginners.
- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.
The boy leads and the girl always fits in.
"In his things we found fishing lines, hooks and lures!"
What do you think he was going to do with all that?
I think we've all had quite enough.
I have therefore decided to expel Inochkin.
I'm done.
"""No exit without permission."""
- Kostya!
Kostya!
- Come back to visit!
- Come back to visit!
- Comrade Dynin?
- That's my name.
- Comrade Dynin.
"- What ""comrade Dynin?"""
- It's not fair.
I think...
- You think too much.
- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!
- You're all flustered about this Inochkin.
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
"Alright, woohoo!"
"Go, Rarity!"
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
"Beautiful, beautiful dresses!"
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
"You're not a laughingstock, Rarity..."
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Just to feel better about yourselves
Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank
What?
"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
Someone's coming!
So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.
Jin-woo...
"If you don't show up, we're through."
We apologizes to customers that the fire alarm has begun.
Please evacuate to the...
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.
Hey!
Hey!
My wish is your command!
Stand back everyone!
Nothing here to see!
The rest are for you Okay?
Damn you!
Landal， what are you doing?
He said...
No， he taught me to play the piano， but I failed
I'll take my leave
Lisa， he...
I forgot to say goodbye to you
Thank you.
Come and drink soup some other day
Outrageous!
I'll win her over for sure
Landal， what are you doing the whole night?
Go and see a doctor tomorrow
What're you doing?
I told you to my underpants but you're watching the landscape
Appear before me when I count up to three 1， 2， 3
Sister wants you to go down to have dinner
Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.
"Then, we're all going out"
I have stuff to do at home I'm sorry
No exceptions this time
That was strong
I have to do the laundry and feed my dog
"That can all wait, can't it?"
My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal
"Then, let it go crazy"
I'll be there in spirit Sorry
"No, you'll be there in person!"
"If it isn't your parents' funeral, be there"
"- She'll never come - This time, she will"
- Bet $100?
- Sure
That's fascist
Fascist?
Me?
I just wanna take the whole crew out!
That doesn't make any sense What's with you?
I don't want to go
You have to
- No - Why?
Not everyone likes to drink
Then don't!
Drink Coke instead!
How can I drink Coke with beer in front of me?
Looking good
"Okay, fine"
I'll go
But I act out when I'm drunk
"Me, too"
I can drink 7 bottles of Soju
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?
What is that?
- (Finebros) I don't know.
"- Do I go straight? - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, God!"
- (headphones clatter) - (high-pitched static)
- (pulsating echo) - (footsteps crunching)
- (claps) - (Finebros laugh)
My fault.
Messed up the microphone.
- At least I got one.
- (Finebros chuckle)
"I was about to quit, too, man. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!"
What the (bleep)?
(high-pitched static)
"Am I going the wrong way, you guys?"
"I'm, like, shaking right now."
"I don't know if you can see it, but I'm kind of shaking."
I'm not liking Slender Man.
"I haven't even seen him, but I already don't like him."
Why does it have to be so dark?
Do an interpretive dance with an accordion.
"And the best of you, the most worthy..."
"Tell me, friends, who do we call the most worthy?"
- Those with a good discipline.
"- Good, who else?"
- Who leave nothing on their plates.
- Who sleep during nap time.
- Who gather grass for rabbits.
- Very good.
"And so, the most worthy ones will be allowed... ...to join the circle of champions wearing masquerade costumes."
- Is showing magic tricks a talent?
- A talent.
"- Okay, I can show the ""flying queen"" card trick."
"- Good stuff, good stuff."
Only no cards.
"Kids, everything goes: magic tricks, art installations, pantomime..."
It's all good.
"Eat, eat."
- Mitrofanova!
"So, are the rumours true?"
- And Comrade Mitrofanov is coming as well!
"- My daddy is coming, too!"
"- You eat, eat."
Don't you know the rule?
No?
"All right, children, let's remind him the rule."
All together now.
- When I'm at my plate  all talks can wait.
- Nap time!
"- For them, but not for us."
"- Come on, come on."
"- Hey, guys."

"Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?"
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.
"Okay, come..."
We have a lot to tell each other.
"Wait, wait..."
"Uhm, well..."
... could you turn your back to me?
- Why?
- Just do it will you?

"What is required of you, my friends?"
- Dis-cip-line!
- I expressly forbade swimming to the island.
But Inochkin ignored the rules and did it anyway.
- They all probably have whooping-cough there!
- No they don't!
"- Quiet, third troop."
"- Try to be more like the second troop, will you?"
Who can guarantee now that Inochkin isn't infected?
Who?
"And it's not the first infraction from him, either!"
On his first day here he started fighting with sticks!
And after him everyone started doing it.
Even girls!
"At night, under his blanket, he lit a flashlight and started reading a book!"
"And everyone else started, too!"
And today he swam to the island!

This marriage can't take place.
Never...
Jimmy!

Gotcha

components are.
"Its components are minus one,"
two.
Good.
That's this guy.
Now I have to take a combination.
What combination shall I take?
"Why not the right combination, what"
the hell?
Okay.
So the combination I'm going
to take is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.
So the right combination is to take
x as one of those and two of these.
It's because we already know that
"that's the right x and y, so why not take the correct"
combination here and see it happen?
"Okay, so how do I picture this"
linear combination?
So I start with this vector that's

There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."

Throat lozenge
"A throat lozenge (it is commonly called a cough drop) is a small pill that slowly breaks in a person's mouth. It breaks because it touches the spit in their mouth and dissolves. When it dissolves, medication inside the lozenge will go inside their body. The medication is sometimes for pain relief, stopping coughs, making your mouth more wet, stopping painful throats, or for other things. They were made for the first time in 1000 BC by Egypt's 20th Dynasty as candies that stop painful throats. They commonly use the drugs benzocaine, menthol, or the plant oil from eucalyptus trees. They sometimes use dextromethorphan to stop coughs and in the 1800s they used morphine and heroin for the same reason."

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."

"In geometry, the diameter of a circle is a line from one side directly to the opposite side through the centre. It can also be defined as the longest chord of a circle. The same explanations can be also used to describe the diameter in a sphere."
"The letter ""d"" or the symbol ⌀ are often used as a symbol for the diameter. The diameter's length is often called the diameter itself."
"The diameter's length is twice the radius, and therefore the relationship between the diameter's length and radius can be shown with the equations:"

Frogs as pets
"Frogs have become a popular exotic pet. They can be kept in basic conditions, compared to reptiles. They are not expensive and their food is easily purchased. Common pet frogs includes ranids, hylids, bufonids, leptodactylids, and dendrobatids."
"Pet frogs can be fed a lot of different live foods. These include crickets, rodents and fish. Small pet frogs will only eat crickets, fruit flies, springtails and other small arthropods. Medium-sized pet frogs can be fed larger crickets, mealworms, butterworms, silkworms, grasshoppers and small fish. Large pet frogs like ""Ceratophrys"" can be fed small fish, other frogs, reptiles, and small mammals such as mice or rats."
"Amphibians of all sizes would need different terrariums. Tree frogs like to climb and can escape if a pet owner does not add a top cover for their tanks. Semi-aquatic amphibians need both land and water divided in the tank. Tropical frogs would need mist and high humidity in their terrariums. All water for amphibians must be dechlorinated. The chlorine can kill amphibians, and may be in tap water. Many amphibians are popular exotic pets and are found in some pet stores."

"About 20% of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks. They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from ."
"Despite the huge numbers, there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera. Some species are known to use the neurotoxin ""tetrodotoxin"" to subdue their prey."
"Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been described from China, and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia."
These animals are usually considered a type of protostome.
Pepper spray
"Pepper spray (also called OC spray, from Oleoresin capsicum) is a spray used for self-defence, by spraying it into an attacker's face. It makes eyes water and causes intense pain, sometimes even leading to temporary blindness. Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. When someone is sprayed with pepper spray, their eyes will close and they will have difficulty breathing, a runny nose, and cough. The stronger the spray is, the longer the effects last, but the average full effect lasts around thirty to forty-five minutes, with longer effects lasting for hours. Pepper spray is mostly used by police forces for riot control, but in some countries people can use it for self-defence."
"The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, a chemical found in capsicums, chillis and other members of the pepper family."
Pepper spray usually comes in canisters and can be sprayed up to twenty-five metres.

"The short-tailed albatross or Steller's albatross (""Phoebastria albatrus"") is a large seabird from the North Pacific. With a wingspan of up to , it is the largest of the Albatrosses of the northern hemisphere. While breeding occurs in large colonies, the adult birds prefer a solitary life. It is a good flyer. 1949, almost all birds were thought to be extinct. When a few were re-discovered in 1951, they were protected. Since then, their numbers have increased, so that in 2022, they are no longer seen as ""endangered"", but as ""vulnerable"". Short-tailed albatrosses feed on cephalopods, fish, and crustaceans. They are oportunists, and will also feed on the organic waste ships throw overboard."
"Although related to the other North Pacific albatrosses, it also exhibits behavioural and morphological links to the albatrosses of the Southern Ocean. It was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from skins collected by Georg Wilhelm Steller (after whom its other common name is derived). Once common, it was brought to the edge of extinction by the trade in feathers, but with protection efforts underway since the 1950s, the species is in the process of recovering with an increasing population trend. Its breeding range, however, remains small.It is a part of the albatross family."

"In 1904, Lorentz showed that electrical and magnetic fields can be modified into each other through the Lorentz transformations."
"In 1905, Einstein published his article introducing special relativity, ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"", in ""Annalen der Physik"". In this article, he presented the postulates of relativity, derived the Lorentz transformations from them, and (unaware of Lorentz's 1904 article) also showed how the Lorentz Transformations affect electric and magnetic fields."
"Later in 1905, Einstein published another article presenting ""E"" = ""mc""2."
"In 1908, Max Planck endorsed Einstein's theory and named it ""relativity"". In that same year, Hermann Minkowski gave a famous speech on ""Space and Time"" in which he showed that relativity is self-consistent and further developed the theory. These events forced the physics community to take relativity seriously. Relativity came to be more and more accepted after that."
"In 1912, Einstein and Lorentz were nominated for the Nobel prize in physics due to their pioneering work on relativity. Unfortunately, relativity was so controversial then, and remained controversial for such a long time that a Nobel prize was never awarded for it."

However, an isomer of icosane, ""n""-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature."
Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.
Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
"The compound is found in the highest concentrations in plants such as Mexican ageratum, licorice, and the Bayrum tree."

.мкд
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
Yeah.
"I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,"
"And, uh,"
"I, I, I'm not a morning person"
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news.
"I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work"
and then at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
right.
"Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,"
huh-uh.
No
"But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know."
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
"But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then."
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet."
"So, you never know,"
it might this time.
That's right.
"Okay, Tony."
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"Yes,"
I am familiar with that.
"I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it."
"And we bought it from someone who was in it,"
"but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm not sure what happened,"
"but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years."
"Oh, no."
"I, I, I found a lot of things,"
"but,"
"I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia."
"Oh, my,"
yeah.
"Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois."
"Oh, do they have one?"
"Yes,"
they do.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Well, I learned something already"
Yeah.
"Well, let's see,"
"the three questions are what, uh,"
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
"Oh, yeah,"
"well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college"
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
"Oh, the wood chuck song"
And I still can to this date.
"And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song"
Yeah.
"Yep,"
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
"Oh, bless your heart."
"Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all."
"Oh, yeah,"
any time I got bored
"Oh, okay,"
"but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?"
No.
No.
"And Jaws,"
but I think everybody can.
Okay.
"I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky"
"because I,"
"if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,"
"but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,"
Yeah.
so
Yeah.
"I played uh, concertos and other stuff"
"but,"
"I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,"
"so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,"
"but anyway,"
Yeah.
"but I enjoy it, though."
"I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit"
Yeah.
"and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think."
"They call late,"
"now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or"
"Oh, they do already."
"See, that's"
I would be so mad
"Well,"
"and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too."
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
"Don't answer your phone, Hello."
"The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello."
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
"I don't know,"
"I think like things that, that"
"I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically."
"Oh, yeah."
That drives me up a wall.
Are you and your roommate a similar size.
"No,"
"see, we're not,"
"and, uh."
And she still goes through your clothes?
"Yeah,"
"she'll take all my shirts and stuff,"
"American Express does that, by the way."
"Oh, they do?"
"Yeah,"
"I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them."
"Well, sure it is."
"And that is an invasion of privacy,"
you're right.
That's right.
"Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere"
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever."
"Exactly,"
"magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing"
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
"But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,"
"you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,"
"so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling."
"Yeah,"
that's right.
"So, I don't know."
"What, what do you, where are you from?"
"Oh, I'm from Texas."
"Oh, okay,"
"well so,"
"yeah,"
"we live in the Dallas area, Richardson."
"Oh, we're in Plano."
Okay
"Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out of state,"
It's not getting any better.
"Yeah,"
I can't even hear what you're
"Oh, okay."
"Oh jeez,"
it's gone.
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,"
"but every time I have this phone is a little weird,"
I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
"Well, I don't know,"
there was
"well, whatever it was, there was a second there"
"I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"
"but, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I was beating on the phone going,"
Can you hear me.
"Yeah,"
I guess I was having a hard time there too.
"I thought it sounded,"
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work."
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
"yeah,"
"I mean, that's a heck of a"
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,"
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil."
"Yeah,"
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes."
Uh-huh.
She likes to really get into her pumpkins
"and see how many she can grow. corn, potatoes,"
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them."
Oh.
Boy.
Yeah
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
"Yeah,"
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog"
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter.
He said it was a good jolt.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques."
Um.
I don't think they're always necessary.
"If you put enough patience into,"
"Yeah,"
just be consistent and diligent with it
Uh-huh.
"and, um,"
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?"
Yeah
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months."
Somebody just told me that
Yeah.
because of the leukemia?
"Yeah,"
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up."
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
Wow.
"So,"
I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
Really.
"I mean, we're all grown,"
"all her kids are grown,"
and we have our own families
Uh-huh.
"and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?"
"Yeah,"
get out of my cabinets.
"Like, what are you doing?"
Don't you have your own house to dig through?
That's great.
"Yeah,"
"so, I guess, privacy is really,"
"and at the work place, I suppose,"
"oh, well, actually yes."
"I can say definitely, privacy at the work place."
Uh-huh.
I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
See.
Yeah.
"because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,"
"and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way."
"You could tell,"
"you know you put your stuff where it's,"
Yeah.
"That would drive, that would, that"
"It would drive, it drove me batty for a while."
Really.
"Yeah,"
"well, I worked a second shift"
Our local schools have adult education in the evening
Oh.
"uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance."
I'm an artist.
"Oh, okay."
And I'm very handy
"and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually."
That's great.
"What, what type of art do you focus on?"
I have a Master's degree
"and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,"
but I'm really interested in the crafts.
Huh.
I make stain glass.
I've done some silver jewelry making
"and I kind of,"
"once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else"
Yeah.

= = = Thomas Shorts = = =
"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

He was consecrated as bishop in Christ Church, New Orleans, on November 7, 1866, by Presiding Bishop John Henry Hopkins, as well as Bishops William Mercer Green, Richard Hooker Wilmer (his cousin), and Charles Todd Quintard. During his episcopate, Bishop Wilmer grew the diocese, despite financial, flooding, and political troubles. During his first eight years, the number of congregations, church buildings, and communicants in the diocese more than doubled. Wilmer died suddenly of apoplexy in New Orleans on December 2, 1878. He was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland."

Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."
"The distinction with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do not conform to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers."

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

= = = Bunge Church = = =
"Bunge Church () is a medieval church in Bunge on the Swedish island of Gotland. The church seen today was largely built during the 14th century and is in a High Gothic style typical for churches on Gotland. Inside, the church is richly decorated with medieval frescos, including depictions of medieval knights whose significance remain contested. Bunge Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden)."
"Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows."
"The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with frescos depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The frescos and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an ""Ordensburg"" (albeit on a small scale)."
The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
"The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building."
"The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with frescos executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion. A single remaining painted glass window remains, a baptismal font from the 13th century and an oddity: a mite box in stone, which is signed by the stonemason in runes, ""Lafrans made this stone""."

= = = Samuel Richardson (Baptist) = = =
"Samuel Richardson (fl. 1646) was an English layman and religious controversialist of the 1640s and 1650s, of Baptist views."
"From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping."
"Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of ""Lord Protector"", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate."
"Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect."
"Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: ""We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough"", Richardson notes."
"Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God’s work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by “faith” simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of “interest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ”."
"Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification:"
"“[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ…yet these are no means of our salvation.”"
"Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism."
Richardson wrote:
"To Richardson have also been ascribed tentatively ""An exact and full Relation of all the Proceedings between the Cavaliers and the Northamptonshire Forces at Banbury"", January 1643–4, signed R. S.; ""The King's March with the Scots, and a List of the 3 Lords, … that submit to the Parliament upon the surrender of Newark"", London, May 1646; and ""Oxford agreed to be surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax"", London, June 1646."

"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

= = = Der Philosophische Arzt = = =
"Der Philosophische Arzt is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician and philosopher to the Russian Empress, Catherine II."
"The first edition of ""Der Philosophische Arzt"" was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770. It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author. The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources. A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a Catholic region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation. This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, Prince Heinrich von Bibra, maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so."

= = = Syöksy-class motor torpedo boat = = =
"The ""Syöksy""-class motor torpedo boats () was a series of four British Thornycroft type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland."
"In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. ""Nuoli"" had the ace of hearts, ""Vinha"" the ace of clubs, ""Syöksy"" the ace of diamonds, and ""Raju"" the ace of spades."
"On 6 July 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead ""Syöksy"" dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond."
"On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. ""Vinha"" was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while ""Syöksy"" made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it."
"On 1 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. ""Syöksy"" torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS ""Meero"", 1,866 tons)."
"On 22 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" sank the Soviet minehunter ""T-41"" (""Kirov"") east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with ""Vinha""."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Nuoli"" participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from ""Sisu"" that sank the target."
"""Syöksy"", ""Vinha"" and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. ""Syöksy"" managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank."
= = = Microsoft Network Monitor = = =
"Microsoft Network Monitor is a deprecated packet analyzer. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ""Bloodhound"") was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team."
Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).
"The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger."
"Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ""Bloodhound"")."
"On May 20, 2013, the President of the United States Barack Obama released a statement that the Administration ""supports"" passage of S. 954 and ""looks forward to working with the Congress to address the important concerns"
"described below prior to final passage."" The announcement listed several reasons that the President supported the bill: elimination of the direct payments system; consolidation and streamlining of conservation assistance; and the inclusion of funding for bioenergy programs. The statement criticized the bill for not adopting all of the Administration's previous proposals for achieving crop insurance and commodity program savings and objected to any cuts at all to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)."
"Senator Debbie Stabenow argued in favor of the bill because it both reduced the deficit and supported ""16 million people who depend on agriculture for their jobs""."
The bill was opposed by groups focusing on hunger due to its reduction in spending on food stamps. It was also criticized by groups such as the Heritage Foundation for including a system of crop insurance that were less about helping farmers in the event of a true disaster and more of an income support system.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized the bill for containing a catfish inspection program that he believes duplicates one that is already conducted by the Food and Drug Administration.

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.
"It was invented by the nineteenth-century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who studied theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine."
"The straight-line linkage confines the point ""P"" – the midpoint on the link ""L"" – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (""L"", ""L"", ""L"", and ""L"" are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point ""P"" deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are"
"Point P is in the middle of ""L"". This relationship assures that the link ""L"" lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel."
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:
"It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,"
"and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point ""P""."
"The motion of the linkage can be constrained to an input angle that may be changed through velocities, forces, etc. The input angles can be either link ""L"" with the horizontal or link ""L"" with the horizontal. Regardless of the input angle, it is possible to compute the motion of two end-points for link ""L"" that we will name A and B, and the middle point P."

"General Sir Arthur James Lyon Fremantle (11 November 1835 – 25 September 1901) was a British Army officer and a notable British witness to the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Whilst holding the rank of ""Captain and Lieutenant Colonel"" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist."
"Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon. He was called ""Arthur"" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829."
"After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army."
"The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS ""Sumter"", pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the ""Sumter"" was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS ""Alabama"". Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas."
"Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface:"

"12 pentagrams and 20 rhombic clusters are necessary. However, this construction replaces the crossing pentagonal faces of the dodecadodecahedron with non-crossing sets of rhombi, so it does not produce the same internal structure."
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common), and with the great dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common)."

"The truncated small stellated dodecahedron looks like a dodecahedron on the surface, but it has 24 faces: 12 pentagons from the truncated vertices and 12 overlapping as (truncated pentagrams). The truncation of the dodecadodecahedron itself is not uniform and attempting to make it uniform results in a degenerate polyhedron (that looks like a small rhombidodecahedron with {10/2} polygons filling up the dodecahedral set of holes), but it has a uniform quasitruncation, the truncated dodecadodecahedron."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-4 pentagonal tiling, by distorting the pentagrams back into regular pentagons. As such, it is topologically a regular polyhedron of index two:"

= = = Ribbon category = = =
"In mathematics, a ribbon category, also called a tortile category, is a particular type of braided monoidal category."
"A monoidal category formula_1 is, loosely speaking, a category equipped with a notion resembling the tensor product (of vector spaces, say). That is, for any two objects formula_2, there is an object formula_3. The assignment formula_4 is supposed to be functorial and needs to require a number of further properties such as a unit object 1 and an associativity isomorphism. Such a category is called braided if there are isomorphisms"
"A braided monoidal category is called a ribbon category if the category is left rigid and has a family of ""twists"". The former means that for each object formula_6 there is another object (called the left dual), formula_7, with maps"
such that the compositions
"equals the identity of formula_7, and similarly with formula_6. The twists are maps"
such that
"To be a ribbon category, the duals have to be compatible with the braiding and the twists in a certain way."
"An example is the category of projective modules over a commutative ring. In this category, the monoidal structure is the tensor product, the dual object is the dual in the sense of (linear) algebra, which is again projective. The twists in this case are the identity maps.
