"You co , you could be a social worker or something."
"Alright , I'll be a social worker."
Okay.

What's your name then?
"Er, my name is erm  Mr  ."
Are you homeless or
"No, she's a social worker."
No I'm not homeless I'm  gonna try and help you are
You're going to try and help us then are you?
"If I can, yeah."
What do you think it is that causes homelessness?
"Well, we've just had a discussion about this in the hall."
Oh right!
No.
Erm  a lot of things.
"Have you, have you encountered many  problems with homelessness?"
Are you
A lot of problems.
"Is that, is that your erm main area?"
Not finished now.
I want to do it.
"Well I'll he look it's difficult to get the last bit out of soup cups, I'll help you."
You do it then.
Here you are.
I'll tip
"wait a minute look, you've got some on the table, you don't want your sleeve in that."
I don't that bit there.
You don't want that piece?
Right let's sling it on the garage roof for the birds.
Here you are stuggies Wo!
For the birds.
I hit it.
Right from the back door.
D'ya think
It's the
I'm brilliant?
I give it the birds.
"Er, wait a minute."
D'ya want a
I think you brilliant.
You think I'm brilliant?
That's good.
Do you want something else to eat?
I do.
Well sit back at the table please.
Don't get off your chair until you've finished.
I sit there.
Let's see  what I've got
I want
Let's see what I
No
And you say they're nothing to do with Mark
No.
?
It's unbelievable isn't it?
Isn't it Yeah.
Unless it's Smith in Cypriot or something .
Don't know.
Don't think she's Cypriot.
None of them sound Cypriot but
So what's his wife teach then?
English.
We have him for history and her for English.
And her for English?
Yo!
Yeah.
Mm.
"She's the one we did our Geoffrey Chaucer project, project with."
I always feel guilty passing Mike's house.
"We really should sort of take him to football, don't you?"
But
they are.
I don't think he's I don't think he's interested as you is he really?
"No, nowhere near."
But  he's probably not there.
"He's probably at a party or something like that, or"
Yeah.
"I don't think he's got any lack of things to do, has he?"
Really?
No.
He never seems to have any homework to do though.
"all those Christmas trees in that lorry, look."
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't know why?
Unless it's Euro or international  and then it's in metres.
"What are you refer , what are you referring to that one, that, what does that"
That's for loading containers?
That's what you ship in .
Yeah that's for international you see.
Oh right.
It's a different one.
I didn't realize I was
No.
international.
No.
It's not the same.
That's what containers do don't they?
They seal containers and export it to different er  ratio.
"But the cubic idea is the same, but it's six point six  cu , kilos per cubic foot."
So a metre would be  about three  it's a cubic metre.
We'll work on that one.
"Gotta be nine ,"
Nine.
nine
Nine.
cubic metres in a
metres
yard.
"About the same sa , in ten."
Mm.
It's about the same.
What I can't understand is
Not a ton.
"is why we mix, why we mix the measures."
Okay.
First.
Can I see the other one?
That you won't let me see!
No!
Why not!
I said not!
Great!
"So if I wrote a letter  and wouldn't let you see it, how would you feel?"
I wouldn't feel anything cos I'm not really bothered!
What if it's about you as well?
Well if you write something about me  you write something about me!
"And if I don't let you see it, I'm dead?"
Yeah.
You're clever!
"Very, very clever!"
Well you think you are!
"Well, if you think, you think!"
Do you know that's ?
Is it?
Well  I've not too bothered  if you found everything.
No.
Who?
As long as you got on well.
Really get into rather than I wouldn't take all that much notice of it.
Would you?
No.
"It's funny, in a bit, in a way."
Yeah.
Yo yo it was sort of like  he got  he got hit on the  got run over
Knocked down.
Oh!
That just proves what you already know.
"Right dad, I'll show you something else."
No.
I was going to do more
"But I wa I want to show you something, that's all."
Go on then.
"Nine, fifty six  square root."
Er
Who taught you that?
"Well, I lis no one."
It's Mrs  said to Mark
Just a minute.
"he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong."
He pressed square root instead of equals .
Yes.
And so you've discovered
Eh!
"the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine."
But do you know what square root means?
What?
Well the square root of a number
Yes.
is the number which if multiplied by itself
Yes.
gives you back the number you started with.
"Take, for , the easiest one is  four."
The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Right.
What do I press?
"Four  four, square root  and it gives you two."
Because two times two  gives you four.
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
"Yeah, I just press this one."
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
"Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six."
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
"What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be."
"Don't, don't press the button."
Six.
Er er
"What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?"
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
"I don six, six."
It's three.
No.
we'll only be briefing the interview staff
That's right.
and accounts staff.
Yeah.
So we're only talking about half a dozen
Well  I think it's slightly more.
Well eight or ten or something isn't it?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks .
"Yeah you're talking about a dozen people, something like that aren't you?"
I mean for that er
Well if necessary we can bring them into here.
Yeah.
Half a dozen and half a dozen
Yeah.
"That's, I can't see that being a problem, that should be okay ."
Have you briefed  before?
Yeah.
Well Mike comes out.
Mike shows his face doesn't he?
Well he did for the Wigan one.
I did it for the erm Ormskirk one
Yeah.
That was okay wasn't it?
We did that in two shifts didn't we?
Two days.
Yeah.
Two mornings.
We had a hell of a lot of staff though didn't we?
"That was a, we did that in the conference room downstairs."
Mm.
They won again!
Oh Swindon slipped again.
"They should have won that, against Grimsby."
"That is so unlucky, Ian."
Will they be home by now?
"Eight o'clock, they're hoping to get home."
Er yeah I bet
Four nil .
Still.
Poor kids.
Oh I feel sorry for them.
Yeah.
You get used to it if you support Palace but
Shut it!
"I was just gonna say, what games have we lost?"
"We are getting used to it, I mean there was a coup , a sea , last season we had"
Five one you lost not long ago!
"Yeah but I mean  last season we hardly, Paulie and I hardly ever used to come home having lost."
Now we're starting to get used to it.
Now you  lot.
"What have we lost at home, Paulie, this season?"
Come on.
A lot.
Arsenal.
Yes.
Man United.
Is that all?
Oh and you lost
No hang on.
That's the two we've seen.
Have we lost any others?
"Oh well we can't complain then, only two."
Good boy.
Look at this house.
Luxembourg there.
Oh that's nice isn't it?
Yeah.
Is that in the same village?
Yeah.
You can go the coach route can't you?
We wondered round the streets just taking photos.
You can go the coach route can't you?
"Yeah well  we was, we was gonna go down the west coast  go and see Rome and then down from there."
Yeah.
But the weather was terrible.
"I was driving through what, eighteen inches of water."
Yeah  when you go through Switzerland.
Yeah.
It seems to be following you.
Yeah well Switzerland weren't too bad cos the road surfaces are pretty good.
Yeah.
But in Italy there's no drainage.
Ooh.
"but on, on a motorway  brand new motorway, no lines"
Yeah.
"no white lines, nothing."
No?
about eighteen inches of water.
Right?
Cor!
And the cars are just  straight on.
"You know,"
Went round taking  photos of old and the new.
See this is the new stuff that's going up.
Three times three.
I don't know the answer!
Well look  three  three  and three.
So how many have you got?
Ten.
No!
Plonker !
You've got nine.
I'm just going
Anyway
to check.
"So, there you are."
"It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half."
Which isn't quite right.
"Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time."
That gets very difficult.
Right.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
"Right, I'll show you."
Ten  square root  is
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Right.
Eh eh.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You don't really need that information do you?
Well dad!
"So what, what, what sort of information do you need?"
Tt.
Counting information.
Nobody.
I think I have not.
You haven't Paul?
I don't think so.
It's the  of the company and fax it.
I'll look in mine tomorrow.
You think you have?
See
if I don't know by now
see how you do.
"We won't, it's just"
a very casual sale.
Well I'm not.
"Just think, use your options."
"This is so , you know so many days"
Yes.
Yeah.
Just use different options.
Alright?
Better put your name at the top of the page as well.
We'll go through the answers anyway.
"Instead of just spouting at me, I'd just like you all to engage brain with ."
"Do you do, I've got one wrong."
"Alright, just  make some notes  and stuff that you've got already."
Right.
I got lost .
What happens in  is you do have the people in that area  in the first few weeks .

"Is that it, I don't want the veggies, grapes, pears, iceberg, toms, cress, I think that's the lot ."
Do you want a bag?.
"Well it wouldn't come amiss, though"

I've already dropped .
You want to drop the tomatoes.

You take the bag I'll take the money .

Of course I don't give them any money!
"Bearing in mind that you're rich enough to live in Surrey, and some people can't even afford a roof over their head don't you think you have a moral obligation towards these people?"

Graphs.
important thing about graphs.
Erm.
Are they ?
"If there was an exam question which said sketch a graph of, where would the marks be found?"
What would you get marks for?
The axes.
"Okay, X and Y."
The  points
Which parti particular points?
Points given for  like co-ordinates.
"Erm let's , if they say sketch a graph,"
Right.
I they wouldn't give you any points.
Erm  directions.
Or shape of the line.
"Okay, general shape."
What would be the interesting parts of the shape?
Where it crosses through the X and Y axes.
"Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point?"
Erm
.
Just checking
it was on at a reasonable volume.
Erm  end   or  anything else that might be interesting .
Mm.
Where it cross the X and Y erm
What's  where are the interesting points on that?
Er er er   there  .
"Okay and these are, these are fairly interesting as well."
Just .

Yeah.
"Then he came in  er   sort of  right at the end said, well look, I'm so cheesed off with you lot"

"She said, look  let me know, how much it's going to cost me to get rid of this, because I've had enough!"
And we've only just bought it !
Well
So er
"June , last year."

"Where I mean our, invariably our in involvement is much greater than the Q S."
Naturally.
"And many of my staff in s in not just  but one or two others, see this as the tail wagging the dog if you like where somebody says, you will do so and so, or you know, I'm telling you you'll do this."
Now it's how you read that into that procedure.
That's the problem with it.
There's no problem I
I understand that.
"mean that, you know, why?"
Why should the Q S estimate all our work?
Mm.
The there is no real good reason
Why he shouldn't.
why he shouldn't other than the fact that  keeping
In fact there's a
up to date.
There's a very good reason why he
Could he do that?
should.
Perhaps.
Is he doing that now?
No.
No.
No.
Not yet.
No.

Accidents on site.
Bridge office report.

We should all have received a report from Roger about one or two accidents that have occurred on sites.

I haven't seen that.
Haven't you?
Team brief items here we are.
There we are.
Haven't you?
"Tt, tt, tt, tt, tt, tt"
They were sent down on time I think weren't they?
You did.
It was a very good report.
Oh.
Well.
Just cos they came down doesn't make the  bit of
Here we are.
It was dated the fifteenth of April nineteen ninety three.
Erm and erm one was at Norfolk Park viaduct.
"A mobile access platform tipped over, and a steel erector was injured during its recovery."
We briefly mentioned that one last time if you remember.

Putting your scarf across the car like that.

"What's all this, why does Meltis always have that stand of eighty, eighty years?"
But we don't even measure yet .
"I, I've yet, I've got a, a major job on my hands to reeducate people and bring in systems for much more accurate measurement of our work."
It's a very difficult job to measure is M and E.
Mm.
Well a lot of them are just
because
lump sums aren't they?
Well I mean a lot of it can't be measured you know?
Mm.
Mm.
"Hundreds of miles of, of cables"
Cables
on a site
Trunking
for example.
Yeah.
You know we we are not geared
S s
up to measure yet properly.
And we need to be.
Right.
So I'm saying we're wa way off what the procedures are currently saying.
A and all I'm saying is that and I rest my case
Mm.
is that
If we came to be audited
"procedures should be  what is happening, not what our aspirations are."
No.
I'm sorry.
Particularly when they're long way .
No.
"But, but when you're measuring something"
It hasn't actually happened.
Yes.
"You're, you're implementing a procedure here that doesn't exist, is what Jim's saying."
You're implementing a procedure
Within B E S.
which says you're gonna do this
Right?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No.
It doesn't say that.
This procedure should say you do this.
That's what we're doing at the moment.
Right.
he's quite right in saying
book is an instruction.
Yeah.
And Jim's
"quite right in saying, it does not happen."
But it's not the first time that a procedure's
Finished.
come out early.
So you've implemented a procedure for wh which you haven't set up you haven't even looked at the resource information
but can be briefed
We are introducing a procedure.
Yes.
And in order to c come in and say
like that?
No.
why don't you do this?
"And I could say well I, I've never done this."
"I can't do this, and Q S is not geared up to do it."
"turn that handle, see you later then"

"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .

You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
"If you 'd sassed her back , I 'd have thought she deserved it and would n't have blamed you a mite , but I would n't have bothered coming to talk to you either ."
"Well , well well !"
"Poor child , do n't cry ."
You just pick up and go home .
I 'll make it all right with Tom .
"You 're pretty near played out yourself , I can see that ."
"But a summer in Fir Cottage , with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery , will soon make another girl of you ."
Do n't you dare to thank me .
It 's a privilege to be able to do something for Mary Carvell 's girls .
I just loved Mary . ''
"The upshot of the whole matter was that Marcella and Patty went , two days later , to Dalesboro , where Miss Draper gave them a hearty welcome to Fir Cottage -- a quaint , delightful little house circled by big Scotch firs and overgrown with vines ."
Never were such delightful weeks as those that followed .
Patty came rapidly back to health and strength .
"As for Marcella , Miss Draper 's prophecy was also fulfilled ; she soon looked and felt like another girl ."
"The dismal years of drudgery behind her were forgotten like a dream , and she lived wholly in the beautiful present , in the walks and drives , the flowers and grass slopes , and in the pleasant household duties which she shared with Miss Draper ."
"`` I love housework , '' she exclaimed one September day ."
`` I do n't like the thought of going back to the store a bit . ''
"`` Well , you 're not going back , '' calmly said Miss Draper , who had a habit of arranging other people 's business for them that might have been disconcerting had it not been for her keen insight and hearty good sense ."
`` You 're going to stay here with me -- you and Patty .
"I do n't propose to die of lonesomeness losing you , and I need somebody to help me about the house ."
I 've thought it all out .
"You are to call me Aunt Josephine , and Patty is to go to school ."
"I had this scheme in mind from the first , but I thought I 'd wait to see how we got along living in the same house , and how you liked it here , before I spoke out ."
"No , you need n't thank me this time either ."
I 'm doing this every bit as much for my sake as yours .
"Well , that 's all settled ."
"Patty wo n't object , bless her rosy cheeks ! ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"said Marcella , with eyes shining through her tears ."
"`` I 'm so happy , dear Miss Draper -- I mean Aunt Josephine ."
I 'll love to stay here -- and I will thank you . ''
`` Fudge ! ''
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
`` He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day .
"She did not look very happy , but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances . ''"
"`` Anyhow , '' thought Rilla , `` I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys ."
How Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid 's part in it ! ''
But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station .
"The dawn was white as a pearl , clear as a diamond ."
Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted .
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at Ingleside .
Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his .
Rilla choked suddenly .
It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flat-featured .
It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
"All that mattered was that rapt , sacrificial look in her eyes -- that ever-burning , sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front ."
"Rilla walked away , realising that she must not spy on such a moment ."
"She went down to the end of the platform where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting , looking at each other ."
Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly : `` Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land ?
Is it a pose ?
Or a fixed idea ? ''
"Whereat Dog Monday , laconically : `` I have a tryst to keep . ''"
When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda .
"`` Well , he 's gone , '' said Miranda , `` and he may never come back -- but I 'm his wife , and I 'm going to be worthy of him ."
I 'm going home . ''
`` Do n't you think you had better come with me now ? ''
asked Rilla doubtfully .
Nobody knew yet how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter .
`` No .
"If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father , '' said Miranda daringly ."
`` A soldier 's wife ca n't be a coward .
"Come on , Wilfy ."
I 'll go straight home and meet the worst . ''
"There was nothing very dreadful to face , however ."
"Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda -- also , that there was such a thing as a separation allowance ."
"Emily , who had said nothing , now spoke harshly ."
"`` Lynde is right , Mr. Douglas ."
You have no right to risk your life for a stranger .
"My advice is to go to the village for help , and Lynde and I will make a fire and watch here ."
That is all that can be expected of you or us . ''
Alan paid no heed to Emily .
Very tenderly he loosened Lynde 's hold on his arm and looked into her quivering face .
"`` You know it is my duty , Lynde , '' he said gently ."
"`` If anything can be done for that poor man , I am the only one who can do it ."
"I will come back safe , please God ."
"Be brave , dear . ''"
"Lynde , with a little moan of resignation , turned away ."
Old Emily looked on with a face of grim disapproval as Alan waded out into the surf that boiled and swirled around him in a mad whirl of foam .
"The shower of sleet had again slackened , and the wreck half a mile away , with its solitary figure , was dearly visible ."
"Alan beckoned to the man to jump overboard and swim ashore , enforcing his appeal by gestures that commanded haste before the next shower should come ."
For a few moments it seemed as if the seaman did not understand or lacked the courage or power to obey .
The next minute he had dropped from the rigging on the crest of a mighty wave and was being borne onward to the shore .
"Speedily the backwater was reached and the man , sucked down by the swirl of the wave , threw up his arms and disappeared ."
"Alan dashed in , groping , swimming ; it seemed an eternity before his hand clutched the drowning man and wrenched him from the undertow ."
"And , with the seaman in his arms , he staggered back through the foam and dropped his burden on the sand at Lynde 's feet ."
"Alan was reeling from exhaustion and chilled to the marrow , but he thought only of the man he had rescued ."
"The latter was unconscious and , as Alan bent over him , he heard Lynde give a choking little cry ."
"`` He is living still , '' said Alan ."
`` We must get him up to the house as soon as possible .
How shall we manage it ? ''
"`` Lynde and I can go and bring the Captain 's mattress down , '' said Emily ."
Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could .
`` Then you and I can carry him up to the house . ''
"`` That will be best , '' said Alan ."
`` Go quickly . ''
He did not look at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face .
She cast one glance at the prostrate man and followed Emily .
"Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !"
"He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! ''"
"`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . ''"
"` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver ."
"`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
"I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''"
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
"I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel ."
"Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard ."
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
"They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets ."
"Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts ."
But that 's not the course I lay .
"I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion ."
"I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest ."
"Time enough too , says you ."
"Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea ."
And how did I begin ?
"Before the mast , like you ! ''"
"`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ?"
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
"`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? ''"
asked Silver derisively .
"`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion ."
"`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor ."
But my old missis has it all by now .
"And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me ."
"I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . ''"
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
asked the other .
"`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it ."
"But I have a way with me , I have ."
"Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house ."
This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . ''
"They took up the old archer , and carried him between them into his house , where he had dwelt alone ."
"And there they laid him on the floor , out of regard for the mattress , and sought , as best they might , to straighten and compose his limbs ."
Appleyard 's house was clean and bare .
"There was a bed , with a blue cover , a cupboard , a great chest , a pair of joint-stools , a hinged table in the chimney corner , and hung upon the wall the old soldier 's armoury of bows and defensive armour ."
Hatch began to look about him curiously .
"`` Nick had money , '' he said ."
`` He may have had three score pounds put by .
I would I could light upo n't !
"When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him ."
"See , now , this chest ."
I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein .
"He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer ."
Now may God rest his spirit !
"Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he 's on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . ''"
"`` Come , Hatch , '' said Dick , `` respect his stone-blind eyes ."
Would ye rob the man before his body ?
"Nay , he would walk ! ''"
"Hatch made several signs of the cross ; but by this time his natural complexion had returned , and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose ."
"It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded , and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall , portly , ruddy , black-eyed man of near fifty , in a surplice and black robe ."
"`` Appleyard '' -- the newcomer was saying , as he entered ; but he stopped dead ."
`` Ave Maria ! ''
he cried .
`` Saints be our shield !
What cheer is this ? ''
"`` Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , '' answered Hatch , with perfect cheerfulness ."
"`` Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates ."
Ay !
"there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . ''"
"Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool , and sat down upon it , sick and white ."
`` This is a judgment !
"`` Oh , I did n't mean to deceive you !"
I never thought of such a thing .
"When you asked me to write to you I wanted to , but I did n't know what to write about to a stranger ."
"I just could n't write you about my life here , not because it was hard , but it was so ugly and empty ."
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live -- the life I did live in imagination .
"And when once I had begun , I had to keep it up ."
"I found it so fascinating , too !"
Those letters made that other life seem real to me .
I never expected to meet you .
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me .
"Oh , please go away and forgive me if you can !"
I know I can never make you understand how it came about . ''
Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her .
It was worse than she had even thought it would be .
"He was so handsome , so manly , so earnest-eyed !"
"Oh , what a friend to lose !"
John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her .
"There was a great tenderness in his face , mingled with a little kindly , friendly amusement ."
"`` Please do n't distress yourself so , Sidney , '' he said , unconsciously using her Christian name ."
`` I think I do understand .
I 'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for .
"After all , those letters were true -- or , rather , there was truth in them ."
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life . ''
"Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him , a little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe ."
This young man was certainly good at understanding .
`` You -- you 'll forgive me then ? ''
she stammered .
"`` Yes , if there is anything to forgive ."
"And for my own part , I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were ."
"If I had come here and found you what I expected , living in such a home as I expected , I never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters have been the things most eagerly looked forward to ."
"I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you , and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning , and that would have been all ."
"`` But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl , much like my sisters at home , except that she is a great deal cleverer ."
I must not even come here any more .
You understand that ? ''
`` Yes . ''
There was an unconscious revelation in the girl 's mournful eyes as she turned them on Alan .
It thrilled him to the core of his being .
She loved him .
"If it were not for that empty marriage form , he could win her , but the knowledge was only an added mocking torment ."
Alan had not known a man could endure such misery and live .
A score of wild questions rushed to his lips but he crushed them back for Lynde 's sake and held out his hand .
"`` Good-bye , dear , '' he said almost steadily , daring to say no more lest he should say too much ."
"`` Good-bye , '' Lynde answered faintly ."
When he had gone she flung herself down on the moss by the spring and lay there in an utter abandonment of misery and desolation .
Pain and indignation struggled for mastery in Alan 's stormy soul as he walked homeward .
So this was Captain Anthony 's doings !
He had sacrificed his daughter to some crime of his dubious past .
Alan never dreamed of blaming Lynde for having kept her marriage a secret ; he put the blame where it belonged -- on the Captain 's shoulders .
Captain Anthony had never warned him by so much as a hint that Lynde was not free to be won .
It had all probably seemed a good joke to him .
Alan thought the furtive amusement he had so often detected in the Captain 's eyes was explained now .
He found Elder Trewin in his study when he got home .
The good Elder 's face was stern and anxious ; he had called on a distasteful errand -- to tell the young minister of the scandal his intimacy with the Four Winds people was making in the congregation and remonstrate with him concerning it .
"Alan listened absently , with none of the resentment he would have felt at the interference a day previously ."
A man does not mind a pin-prick when a limb is being wrenched away .
"`` I can promise you that my objectionable calls at Four Winds will cease , '' he said sarcastically , when the Elder had finished ."
"Elder Trewin got himself away , feeling snubbed but relieved ."
"`` Took it purty quiet , '' he reflected ."
`` Do n't believe there was much in the yarns after all .
Isabel King started them and probably she exaggerated a lot .
I suppose he 's had some notion like as not of bringing the Captain over to the church .
"But that 's foolish , for he 'd never manage it , and meanwhile was giving occasion for gossip ."
It 's just as well to stop it .
"He 's a good pastor and he works hard -- too hard , mebbe ."
They then quarrelled ; the cause of the quarrel was insignificant ; with anyone else than Eugene a reconciliation would soon have been effected .
But Eugene never was friendly with your father from that time .
I think he was jealous of old Grandfather 's affection ; thought the old man loved your father best .
"And then , as I have said , he was very eccentric and stubborn ."
"Well , your father went away to college and graduated , and then -- we were married ."
Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying me .
He wanted him to marry somebody else .
He told him he would disinherit him if he married me .
I did not know this until we were married .
But Grandfather Page kept his word .
"He sent for a lawyer and had a new will made , leaving everything to Eugene ."
"I think , nay , I am sure , that he would have relented in time , but he died the very next week ; they found him dead in his bed one morning , so Eugene got everything ; and that is all there is of the story , Dorinda . ''"
`` And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since ? ''
"`` Yes , ever since ."
"So you see , Dorinda dear , that I can not ask any favours of Uncle Eugene . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , '' said Dorinda understandingly ."
"We kept thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home , dining off potatoes on Thanksgiving !"
But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied .
When Kate and I were washing the dishes she came out quite beamingly .
"`` Well , my dears , I must admit that you made a very good job of the dinner , indeed ."
The turkey was done to perfection .
"As for the mince pies -- well , of course Miranda Mary made them , but she must have had extra good luck with them , for they were excellent and heated to just the right degree ."
"You did n't give anything to the McGinnis dog , I hope ? ''"
"`` No , we did n't give him anything , '' said Kate ."
Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis .
When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out of the house and went home .
Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we had n't robbed them of their dinner .
But we had to tell them the whole story before we even took off our hats .
"`` There is a special Providence for children and idiots , '' said Laura gently ."
We did n't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or both .
There are some things better left in obscurity .
I 'd have probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously .
"If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . ''"
"`` Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , '' I added ; `` the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . ''"
"`` They 'll have a hot run , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Jack ashore , you know ."
It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round-shot .
Carpet bowls !
My lady 's maid could n't miss .
"Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . ''"
"In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process ."
"We were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees ."
The gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes .
"The ebb-tide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants ."
The one source of danger was the gun .
"`` If I durst , '' said the captain , `` I 'd stop and pick off another man . ''"
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot .
"They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and I could see him trying to crawl away ."
`` Ready ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Hold ! ''
"cried the captain , quick as an echo ."
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water .
The report fell in at the same instant of time .
"This was the first that Jim heard , the sound of the squire 's shot not having reached him ."
"Where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster ."
"At any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet ."
"The other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling ."
So far there was no great harm .
"No lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety ."
"But there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service ."
"Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct ."
"As for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost ."
The other three had gone down with the boat .
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the outer edge, took a ""header"" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this wonderful story in a few words: ""This cat on September 23, 1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."""
A Brave Queen
"Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea."
"Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two daughters whom she loved very much."
"Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed."
"Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the foes of their beautiful queen."
"They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them."
The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous enemies of Boadicea and her people.
"In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat them cruelly."
"This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered together, they fell upon the Romans."
"There were so many of them, and they were so fierce, that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships."
"But there were many more Romans in other parts of Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni."
"The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves, but many of their brave men had been slain and others were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to win a victory over their strong foes."
"Before the battle, Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind, stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove to and fro, so that all might see them."
"And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen."
"They did fight long and bravely, until most of them were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten, she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel Romans."
King Alfred and the Cakes
"Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest."
"Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen."
"Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work."
"At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task."
"When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. ""You are an idle fellow,"" cried she angrily. ""You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them."""
"While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home. He knew King Alfred. ""Hush, wife!"" cried he. ""It is our noble lord the king!"""
"When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and she begged Alfred to forgive her."
"The king smiled, and said: ""I will gladly forgive you for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for spoiling your supper."""
"Not Angles, but Angels"
"In old days the people of England were not all free, as they are now."
"Sometimes young men, and women, and little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard for their masters."
"Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have them as their servants."
"Once he was hard pressed for means, as he was trying to run a farm, and running a farm costs money: so he went to a bank to borrow. He hated to do it, because he had no special inducements to offer a bank or to make it hilariously loan him money."
"""How much did you think you would need, Mr. Webster?"" asked the President, cutting off some coupons as he spoke and making paper dolls of them."
"""Well, I could get along very well,"" said Webster, in that deep, resinous voice of his, ""if I could have two thousand dollars."""
"""Well, you remember,"" said the banker, ""do you not, that you have two thousand dollars here, that you deposited five years ago, after you had dined with the Governor of North Carolina?"""
"""No, I had forgotten about that,"" said Webster. ""Give me a blank check without unnecessary delay."""
We may learn from this that Mr. Webster was not a careful man in the matter of detail.
"His speech on the two-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was a good thing, and found its way into the press of the time."
"His speech at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, and his eulogy of Adams and Jefferson, were beautiful and thrilling."
"Daniel Webster had a very large brain, and used to loan his hat to brother Senators now and then when their heads were paining them, provided he did not want it himself."
"His reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in 1830, was regarded as one of his ablest parliamentary efforts. Hayne attacked New England, and first advanced the doctrine of nullification, which was even more dangerous than secession, Jefferson Davis in 1860 denying that he had ever advocated or favored such a doctrine."
"Webster spoke extempore, and people sent out for their lunch rather than go away in the midst of his remarks."
"Webster married twice, but did not let that make any difference with his duty to his country."
"He tried to farm it some, but did not amass a large sum, owing to his heavy losses in trying year after year to grow Saratoga potatoes for the Boston market."
"No American, foreign or domestic, ever made a greater name for himself than Daniel Webster, but he was not so good a penman as Noah; Noah was the better pen-writer."
"Noah Webster also had the better command of language of the two. Those who have read his great work entitled ""Webster's Elementary Spelling-Book, or, How One Word Led to Another,"" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never lacked for a word by which to express himself."
He was a brainy man and a good speller.
One by one our eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon Bonaparte is no more; and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away.
This has been a severe winter on Red Shirt; and I have to guard against the night air a good deal myself.
"It would ill become me, at this late date, to criticise Mr. Webster's work, a work that is now, I may say, in nearly every home and school-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr."
Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.
"I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks egotistical in me; but, although Noah's book is larger than mine, and has more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through."
"He has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour, perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer stepped down to 47° below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald married the girl or not. Mr. Webster did not seem to care how the affair turned out."
"Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He doesn't keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing, who secured one of my books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he seemed chained to the spot; and if you can't believe a convict who is entirely out of politics, whom, in the name of George Washington, can you trust?"
"Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, though a little inclined, perhaps, to be wordy. I have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike."
"This shows great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome."
"I had heard so much of Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is cold, methodical, dry, and dispassionate in the extreme, and one cannot help comparing it with the works of James Fenimore Cooper and Horace."
"As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of whiling away an idle hour. No one should travel without Mr. Webster's tale. Those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. He kept them off with this tale."
"It is a good book, as I say, to take up for a moment, or to read on the train, or to hold the door open on a hot day. I would never take a long railroad ride without it, eyether. I would as soon forget my bottle of cough-medicine."
"Mr. Webster's Speller had an immense sale. Ten years ago he had sold forty million copies. And yet it had this same defect. It was cold, dull, disconnected, and verbose. There was only one good thing in the book, and that was a little literary gem regarding a boy who broke in and stole the apples of a total stranger. The story was so good that I have often wondered whom Mr. Webster got to write it for him."
"The old man, it seems, at first told the boy that he had better come down, as there was a draught in the tree; but the young sass-box apple-sass-box, I presume told him to avaunt."
"Cornwallis in this Virginia and Southern trip destroyed ten million dollars' worth of property, and then fortified himself at Yorktown."
"Washington decided to besiege Yorktown, and, making a feint to fool Clinton, set out for that place, visiting Mount Vernon en route after an absence of six and a half years, though only stopping two days."
"Washington was a soldier in the true sense, and, when a lad, was given a little hatchet by his father. George cut down some cherry-trees with this, in order to get the cherries without climbing the trees. One day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down, and spoke of it to the lad."
"""Yes,"" said George, ""I did it with my little hatchet; but I would rather cut down a thousand cherry-trees and tell the truth about it than be punished for it."""
"""Well said, my brave boy!"" exclaimed the happy father as he emptied George's toy bank into his pocket in payment for the trees. ""You took the words right out of my mouth."""
"In speaking of the siege of Yorktown, the historian says, ""The most hearty good will prevailed."" What more could you expect of a siege than that?"
"Cornwallis capitulated October 19. It was the most artistic capitulation he had ever given. The troops were arranged in two lines facing each other, British and American with their allies the French under Rochambeau."
"People came from all over the country who had heard of Cornwallis and his wonderful genius as a capitulator. They came for miles, and brought their lunches with them; but the general, who felt an unnecessary pique towards Washington, refused to take part in the exercises himself, claiming that by the advice of his physicians he would have to remain in his tent, as they feared that he had over-capitulated himself already."
"He therefore sent his sword by General O'Hara, and Washington turned it over to Lincoln, who had been obliged to surrender to the English at Charleston."
"The news reached Philadelphia in the night, and when the watchman cried, ""Past two o'clock, and Cornwallis is taken!"" the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics, for they regarded the war as virtually ended. The old door-keeper of Congress died of delight. Thanks were returned to Almighty God, and George Washington's nomination was a sure thing."
"England decided that whoever counselled war any further was a public enemy, and Lord North, then prime minister, when he heard of the surrender of Cornwallis through a New York paper, exclaimed, ""Oh, God!"
"it is all over!"""
"Washington now showed his sagacity in quelling the fears of the soldiers regarding their back pay. He was invited to become king, but, having had no practice, and fearing that he might run against a coup d'état or faux pas, he declined, and spoke kindly against taking violent measures."
"In 1783, September 3, a treaty of peace was signed in Paris, and Washington, delivering the most successful farewell address ever penned, retired to Mount Vernon, where he began at once to enrich his farm with the suggestions he had received during his absence, and to calmly take up the life that had been interrupted by the tedious and disagreeable war."
"The country was free and independent, but, oh, how ignorant it was about the science of government! The author does not wish to be personal when he states that the country at that time did not know enough about affairs to carry water for a circus elephant."
"It was heavily in debt, with no power to raise money. New England refused to pay her poll-tax, and a party named Shays directed his hired man to overturn the government; but a felon broke out on his thumb, and before he could put it down the crisis was averted and the country saved."
CHAPTER XIX.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
"It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon to the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation."
"Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. He was asked at all the towns to build there, and 'most everybody wanted him ""to come and make their house his home."" When he got to the ferry he was not pushed off into the water by commuters, but lived to reach the Old Federal Hall, where he was sworn in."
"In 1791 the seat of government was removed to Philadelphia, where it remained for ten years, after which the United States took advantage of the Homestead Act and located on a tract of land ten miles square, known as the District of Columbia. In 1846 that part of the District lying on the Virginia side of the Potomac was ceded back to the State."
"President Washington did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office-seekers. He could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. He could remain in the forest back of his house until Martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post-office at Pigback had gone, and then he could return."
"How times have changed with the growth of the republic! Now Pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to Hogback, and the President avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in, to leave the swarm of jobless applicants who come to pester him to death for appointments."
The historian begs leave to say here that the usefulness of the President for the good of his country and the consideration of greater questions will some day be reduced to very little unless he may be able to avoid this effort to please voters who overestimate their greatness.
"It is said that Washington had no library, which accounted for his originality. He was a vestryman in the Episcopal Church; and to see his tall and graceful form as he moved about from pew to pew collecting pence for Home Missions, was a lovely sight."
As a boy he was well behaved and a careful student.
"At one time he was given a hatchet by his father, which"
But what has the historian to do with this morbid wandering in search of truth?
"Whiskey will not make a poet, nor poker a great pleader. And yet I have seen poets who relied on the potency of their breath, and lawyers who knew more of the habits of a bobtail flush than they ever did of the statutes in such case made and provided."
"George Washington was always ready. If you wanted a man to be first in war, you could call on George. If you desired an adult who would be first baseman in time of peace, Mr. Washington could be telephoned at any hour of the day or night. If you needed a man to be first in the hearts of his countrymen, George's post-office address was at once secured."
"Though he was a great man, he was once a poor boy. How often you hear that in America! Here it is a positive disadvantage to be born wealthy."
And yet sometimes I wish they had experimented a little that way on me.
"I do not ask now to be born rich, of course, because it is too late; but it seems to me that, with my natural good sense and keen insight into human nature, I could have struggled along under the burdens and cares of wealth with great success. I do not care to die wealthy, but if I could have been born wealthy it seems to me I would have been tickled almost to death."
"I love to believe that true greatness is not accidental. To think and to say that greatness is a lottery, is pernicious. Man may be wrong sometimes in his judgment of others, both individually and in the aggregate, but he who gets ready to be a great man will surely find the opportunity."
"You will wonder whom I got to write this sentiment for me, but you will never find out."
"In conclusion, let me say that George Washington was successful for three reasons. One was that he never shook the confidence of his friends. Another was that he had a strong will without being a mule."
Some people cannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue donkey.
"Another reason why Washington is loved and honored to-day is that he died before we had a chance to get tired of him. This is greatly superior to the method adopted by many modern statesmen, who wait till their constituency weary of them, and then reluctantly pass away."
CHAPTER XIII.
CONTRASTS WITH THE PRESENT DAY.
"Here it may be well to speak briefly of the contrast between the usages and customs of the period preceding the Revolution, and the present day."
"Some of these customs and regulations have improved with the lapse of time, others undoubtedly have not."
"Two millions of people constituted the entire number of whites, while away to the westward the red brother extended indefinitely. Religiously they were Protestants, and essentially they were ""a God-fearing people."""
"Taught to obey a power they were afraid of, they naturally turned with delight to the service of a God whose genius in the erection of a boundless and successful hell challenged their admiration and esteem."
"So, too, their own executions of Divine laws were successful as they gave pain, and the most beautiful features of Christianity, namely, love and charity, according to history, were not cultivated very much."
"There were in New England at one time twelve offences punishable with death, and in Virginia seventeen. This would indicate that the death-penalty is getting unpopular very fast, and that in the contiguous future humane people will wonder why murder should have called for murder, in this brainy, charitable, and occult age, in which man seems almost able to pry open the future and catch a glimpse of Destiny underneath the great tent that has heretofore held him off by means of death's prohibitory rates."
In Hartford people had to get up when the town watchman rang his bell.
"The affairs of the family, and private matters too numerous to mention, were regulated by the selectmen. The catalogues of Harvard and Yale were regulated according to the standing of the family as per record in the old country, and not as per bust measurement and merit, as it is to-day."
"Scolding women, however, were gagged and tied to their front doors, so that the populace could bite its thumb at them, and hired girls received fifty dollars a year, with the understanding that they were not to have over two days out each week, except Sunday and the days they had to go and see their ""sick sisters."""
"Some cloth-weaving was indulged in, and homespun was the principal material used for clothing. Mrs. Washington had sixteen spinning-wheels in her house. Her husband often wore homespun while at home, and on rainy days sometimes placed a pair of home-made trousers of the barn-door variety in the Presidential chair."
"Money was very scarce, and ammunition very valuable. In 1635 musket-balls passed for farthings, and to see a New England peasant making change with the red brother at thirty yards was a common and delightful scene."
"The first press was set up in Cambridge in 1639, with the statement that it ""had come to stay."" Books printed in those days were mostly sermons filled with the most comfortable assurance that the man who let loose his intellect and allowed it to disbelieve some very difficult things would be essentially  well, I hate to say right here in a book what would happen to him."
"The first daily paper, called The Federal Orrery, was issued three hundred years after Columbus discovered America. It was not popular, and killed off the news-boys who tried to call it on the streets: so it perished."
"There was a public library in New York, from which books were loaned at fourpence ha'penny per week. New York thus became very early the seat of learning, and soon afterwards began to abuse the site where Chicago now stands."
"Travel was slow, the people went on horseback or afoot, and when they could go by boat it was regarded as a success. Wagons finally made the trip from New York to Philadelphia in the wild time of forty-eight hours, and the line was called The Flying Dutchman, or some other euphonious name. Benjamin Franklin, whose biography occurs in Chapter XV., was then Postmaster-General."
"He was the first bald-headed man of any prominence in the history of America. He and his daughter Sally took a trip in a chaise, looking over the entire system, and going to all offices. Nothing pleased the Postmaster-General like quietly slipping into a place like Sandy Bottom and catching the postmaster reading over the postal cards and committing them to memory."
"[She holds up her bare arms, with a motion of flight.]"

suddenly]  Play me something.

make me feel just an attractive female.  I wanted somebody like that.
"[Letting her hands rest on the notes]  All the same, I'm glad not to"
be ugly.
MALISE.  Thank God for beauty!
PAYNTER.  [Opening the door]  Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton.
MALISE.  Who are they?
CLARE.  [Rising]  She's my chief pal.  He was in the Navy.

"dark hair and a quick eye.  He, one of those clean-shaven naval"
"men of good presence who have retired from the sea, but not from"
their susceptibility.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Kissing CLARE, and taking in both MALISE and her"
husband's look at CLARE]  We've only come for a minute.

[They greet.]

CLARE.  [Shaking her head]  Reggie lives on his pay.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [With one of her quick looks]  That was Mr. Malise,"
then?
"FULLARTON.  [Coming towards them]  I say, Mrs. Dedmond, you wouldn't"
"sing me that little song you sang the other night,  [He hums]  ""If I"
"might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day""?  Remember?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  ""The falling dew,"" Edward.  We simply must go,"
Clare.  Good-night.  [She kisses her.]
FULLARTON.  [Taking half-cover between his wife and CLARE]  It suits
you down to the ground-that dress.
CLARE.  Good-night.
"HUNTINGDON sees them out.  Left alone CLARE clenches her hands,"

"In 1796 (leap year) the numbers in the table of months, so far as"
"concerns all dates between Feb. 28 and Sept. 22, will have to be"
"_reduced by one_, owing to the intercalation of Feb. 29, which is not"
compensated for until the end of the republican year.
The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans
"reckoned An VIII as a leap year, though it is not one in the Gregorian"
"Calendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding"
years began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the
"numbers of all days from Vendémiaire 1, An IX (Sept. 23, 1800), to"
"Nivôse 10, An XIV (Dec. 31, 1805), inclusive, will have to be"
"_increased by one_, except only in the next leap year between Ventôse"
"9, An XII, and Vendémiaire 1, An XIII (Feb. 28-Sept, 23, 1804), when"
the two Revolutionary aberrations happen to neutralize each other.

The Jewish converts who at first composed the church had a rich heritage
"of song in the Book of Psalms. This was their hymnbook, used in the"
Temple worship and in the home and probably also in the synagogue
"services. The use of the Psalms, carried over from the Jewish service,"
forms to this day an important element in Christian worship.
"Besides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn"
the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use
"of _Hallelujah_ as a part of the people’s praise, adding, in the course"
"of time, the _Gloria Patri_, the _Sanctus_, the _Te Deum_, and other"
canticles.

"Gyp played.  Twice he nodded; once he tapped his fingers on his teeth,"

"down beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:"
"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"
"Trop sympathique!  The back-bone, the back-bone--we shall improve that."
"Now, four hours a day for six weeks--and we shall have something again."""
Gyp said softly:
"""I have a baby, Monsieur Harmost."""
Monsieur Harmost bounded.
"""What!  That is a tragedy!""  Gyp shook her head.  ""You like it?  A baby!"
"Does it not squall?"""
"""Very little."""
"""Mon Dieu!  Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever.  That is"
"something.  Now, what can you do with this baby?  Could you get rid of it"
"a little?  This is serious.  This is a talent in danger. A fiddler, and a"

"sensibility, stroked her hand."

"here.' And again she tried to shut the door, but I prevented her."
'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod

'Whose house is that?' I asked him.

The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of
"Safety,' he said dryly. 'His brother is prefect of this ward. But here"
is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'

"columns of smoke close together, and you ought to know what that means.”"
“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”
"“It may be Jimmie,” Jack suggested."
"“It’s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,” Frank said. “If it’s Jimmie,"
"he’s really in trouble, and if it’s the messenger boy, he’s doing it to"
get more of us into his clutches.”
"“Then we’d better go well armed and ready for any kind of a reception,”"
Jack advised. “No knowing what we’ll find.”
“What’ll we do with Gilroy?” asked Frank.
"“Aw, let him sleep,” advised Harry."
"“Sure, let him sleep,” Jack put in. “He’ll be all right ’till we get"
back. No one will molest the camp in daytime.”
"“Seems to me that we ought to leave someone here,” Frank said."
"“All right, you can stay if you want to!” Jack declared. “Harry and I"
are going down there to see what the trouble is about.”
"“Aw, come on, Frank!” Harry urged. “There won’t anything happen to"
"Gilroy! He may have a bad dream, but that’s about all.”"
“How far do you suppose that signal is from here?” asked Frank.
"“Not more than half a mile,” Harry explained."

two hours ago.”
"“Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma’am?” said Mrs. McCool, with intense"
admiration. “You do be a wonder for rentin’ rooms of that kind. And did
"ye tell him, then?” she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with"
mystery.
"“Rooms,” said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, “are furnished for to"
"rent. I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.”"
"“’Tis right ye are, ma’am; ’tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have"
"the rale sense for business, ma’am. There be many people will rayjict"
the rentin’ of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin’

"“As you say, we has our living to be making,” remarked Mrs. Purdy."
"“Yis, ma’am; ’tis true. ’Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay"

"killin’ herself wid the gas—a swate little face she had, Mrs. Purdy,"

"“She’d a-been called handsome, as you say,” said Mrs. Purdy, assenting"
"but critical, “but for that mole she had a-growin’ by her left eyebrow."
"Do fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.”"
THE BRIEF DÉBUT OF TILDY
"""Awake, Alice?"" Norton asked brightly."
"""Awake again,"" she said unhappily. ""For.... What is it? The ninth day?"""
"""Eighth,"" he said. ""Can't go on much longer."""
"""I hope not."""
"""You look all in,"" he said softly. He sat down on the edge of the"
"divan, beside her, and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. ""Take it"
"easy, m'lady. They're really scouring space for us. We'll be all right."
"You'll see."""
*       *       *       *       *
Unexpectedly he bent and kissed her chastely on the forehead. Alice
"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"
"closer. Every lonely hour means that it can't be many more, because"
"they've covered all the places where we weren't. Follow me, Alice?"""
She shook her head unhappily.
"He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He staggered"
"backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the light"
came on.
"""Yuri Andreevich, so this is where you are. What are you doing here?"""
"It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child again,"
caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?
"""I'm--I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I couldn't"
"sleep."""
"""Don't lie to me."" Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows gathered into the"
"skeptical furrow Yuri knew so well. ""You're up to something, another of"
"your tricks."""
Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?
"""_Moi otyets_, why are you here? You should be getting your sleep."""
"""I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you might be in"
"here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were planning"
"something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is."""
Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.
"No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be ironclad."
"""It's better if you don't know."""
"""As you wish,"" the old man sighed. ""But if you do something foolish . ."
"."""
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"
"puckalow that case and foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a"
"tablecloth as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."""
When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your
"name Sapristi?"""
"""Nom de Dieu----"" began the Frenchman, but Jones waved his hand with"
dignity.
"""Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you got anythin' in the way of"
"a marlinspike or a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"""
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that
"isn't possible. Oh, Lois, there is surely nothing worse than helpless"
"remorse!"""
The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked
"it. I failed him."""
"""Have you really failed him?"""
"""Lois, I don't know--I am beginning to believe not. But it is too"
late. I meant to clear away the rubbish--and build. But there is no
"time."""
"""You have done your best."""
never accepts my invitations.  I cannot tell why.  I don't fancy he
"considers me his friend."""
"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"
"think she said, was Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf.  Who is he?"""
"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"
eyes.
"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"
"admit that your suggestion is correct."""
"""And what is the object of his sudden visit to Paris?"""
"""I cannot make out,"" she replied in a more confidential tone.  ""As I"
"tell you, de Wolkenstein introduced him, but, as m'sieur knows, I am"
"very quick to detect a face that I have once seen, and I recognised him"
"in an instant."""
"They shoved their one ""Dutchman"" forward, and after some interchange"
"of utter un-intelligibilities, listened to by every one with bated"
"breath, Hermann turned round."
"""I not versteh, captain.  I denk him ein French."""
"The Frenchman was joined by two or three more, and then by a dozen."
"""Why, they're all French,"" said the disgusted crowd.  ""What's"
"Frenchmen doin' on any island of ours?"""
"And until the sea went down, which it did sufficiently to allow them"
"to get ashore at about ten o'clock, they discussed the question as to"
whether the Crozets were English or not.  It was settled by old
Mackenzie.
"""All islands as don't belong to any one belongs to us,"" he said; ""it"
"was arranged so by Disraeli."""
"They got ashore with some risk, and were greeted by the Frenchman in"
the most amiable way.
"""Poor beggars!"" said the crew; ""it must be 'ard on a soft lot of"
things like them to be on a des'late hisland.  Ain't it a wonder
"Froggies ever goes to sea?  But does they belong 'ere, or was they"
"piled hup same's hus?"""
Hart found himself alongside a Frenchman with a long red Liberty cap
"on, and a big pair of ear-rings in his ears."

"""All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha."""
"She came over and stood beside him. ""I don't believe this."""
"""Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?"""
"She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and bent down"
"to test the water. ""Feels wet."" She glanced back. ""So what the heck. I"
"could use it."""
"""I'm ready."" He kicked off his tabi and walked on out."
"She pulled off his _yukata_, then picked up one of the pails and began"

stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.
"""They know how to live. Here, let me."" He picked up a second sponge and"
"began scrubbing her back in turn. ""How does it feel?"""
"""Maybe this is heaven."""
"""Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've got a"
"feeling the fun is just beginning."""
"He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as she gingerly"
climbed down into the wooden tub.

"her. ""This has got to be Japan, but where?"""

"""So that's where he's gone?"" he said. ""Well, let him stay there, for all I"

The manufacturer cracked jokes to the very end. Of course he was a little
"depressed by the farewells, too, but he had to keep his family's courage"
"up. His wife stood holding one of his arms with both hands, and the"
children clung to his other arm.
"""I can't salute you,"" the manufacturer said to us, smiling. ""I'm not"
"allowed to say good-bye."""
"The children rejoiced at this and cried, ""No, he can't have his arm back;"
"Mummy, you hold him tight, too!"""
"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"
"""I don't borrow."""
"""Ingeborg!"" said he, pretending playfully to whimper."
"""What is it?"""
"""Nothing. Can't I say 'Ingeborg' to my own wife?"""
"""I'm not your own wife,"" she said, getting up."
"""Pish! We were man and wife last night. It says so in the visitors' book."""
"She was silent at this. Yes, last night they had been man and wife; that"
"was to save getting two rooms, and travel economically. But she had been"
very foolish to agree to it.
"""'Miss Torsen,' then?"" he whimpered."
"And to put an end to the game, she paid for both of them and took her"
knapsack on her back.
They walked again. At the next stop she paid for them both without
"discussion--for the evening meal, for bed and breakfast. It grew to be a"
habit. They walked on once more. They reached the end of the valley by the
"sea, and here she revolted again."
"""Go away--go on by yourself; I don't want you in my room any more!"""
The old argument no longer held good. When he repeated that they saved
"money by it, she replied that she for her part required no more than one"
"room, and was quite able to pay for it. He joked again, whimpered,"
"""Ingeborg!"" and left her. He was beaten, and his back was bent."
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
"""I damned sure intend to try."" He met his father's steely gaze."
"""So did you do it?"" Andrei Androv examined him, his ancient face ashen"
"beneath his mane of white hair. ""Did you manage to sabotage the AI"
"module?"""
"He caught himself laughing out loud. Whatever else, his father was no"
fool. He'd been a Russian too long to believe anything he heard or half
of what he saw. Intrigue was a way of life for him.
"""Let's go. They'll come looking for us soon. This is the wrong place to"
"be found."""
"""You're right."""
"""Go back to the West Quadrant. Listen to a string quartet."" He opened"
"the port and waited for his father to step out. Then he followed,"
"closing it behind them. ""There's no reason for you to be involved."
"Heads are going to roll, but why should yours be one of them?"""
"Andrei Petrovich Androv moved lightly up the metal stair, the spring in"
his step belying his age. At the top he paused and turned back.
"""You're acting out of principle, aren't you, Yuri? For once in your"
"life."""
"""I guess you could say that."" He smiled, then moved on up the steps."
"""Someday, the Russian people will thank you."""
"""Someday. Though I may not live to see it."""
"""Want to give you a little tip, too. They want you upstairs. A"
"commendation. Not generally known, though. And you deserve it. You'll be"
"called up tomorrow."""
"""You never know the day or the hour."""
"The laugh came again. ""You're humor is priceless, old man."""
"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"
"you."""
"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"
"you quote me, I'll deny it."""
"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.
"""Nothing important, Doctor Maynard."""
"""Sit down. Will you have a cigarette?"""
"""No, thank you. I just wanted to ask you about a transfer."""
"""A transfer!"" This was amazing. ""Aren't you happy at Park Hill?"""
"""I've been very happy."""
"Maynard went swiftly through a card file on his desk. ""You have--let's"
"see--five more months of internship. Then--"""
"""Then I'd planned to enter private practice. But something personal has"
"come up and I think a change is for the best."""
"""I'm certainly sorry to hear that."""
"""One of the men I graduated with went to a hospital in a small Minnesota"
town. We've corresponded and he's given me a pretty clear picture--a
"nice town, a need for doctors and physicians--"""
"""But we need them here in the East, too."""
"""I realize that, and I'm making the move with some regret. But, frankly,"
New York City no longer appeals to me. I think perhaps a small hospital
"is more suited to my temperament."""
"""I'm certainly sorry to hear this, Corson. But I won't try to dissuade"
"you. Normally, I might bring a little more personal pressure to bear,"
"but I sense that your mind is made up. We're sorry to see you go, but"
"the best of luck to you."""
"""I think I _tried_ to fight."""
"""Of course, you did. The disgrace was mine. I acted like a child. I"
should have realized that something extraordinary had happened. But I
"nursed my miserable little ego like a three-year-old."""
"""How could you know? My cruelty to you--"""
"""Don't talk like that! I knew about the ninth android, and I met the"
tenth one in front of your apartment that second morning. I should have
"associated. Brent Taber did, otherwise we might both be dead."""
"""It's all over now. It doesn't make any difference."""
"""No, it doesn't make any difference."""
"She looked at him in silence for several moments. ""You've changed,"
"Frank."""
"""Yes, I guess I have. I guess we all grow up eventually. We all face"
"reality and live with it."""
"""Frank--I think I'm going to cry."""
He could not turn his eyes in her direction. He looked straight ahead
"but his voice was soft. ""Go ahead, Rhoda. I understand."""
"They were silent for a time, then Rhoda began to cry quietly into her"
handkerchief. After a while even that sound was stilled.
He turned to look at her. She was standing beside the bed. He almost
"reached out and took her hand, but drew his own back at the last minute."
"Hark forrard, hark forrard, tantivy!"""
ACT I
The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"
"wall.  PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her head, with an"
expression of concern.
PAYNTER.  Where's she gone?
"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?
"BURNEY.  Oh!  Quiet, of course."
"Captured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of"
taking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in
"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"
Captain Morgan in one of the prizes.
"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."

"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.

"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"

"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"

"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"

"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
“I fled.
“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.
"before these, or will you see me alone?'"
"'Your spy, that cat there,' my lady answered, carried away by her"
"temper, 'may go! The women will stay.'"
"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"
hound!'
"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady
"Margaret’s son has gone on the stage.... Gerty, do you know who that"
"dark creature is? with the Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the"
"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"

“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."
"Mrs. Marchmont arrived, accompanied by an old man who evidently was her"
"to record,--Cleopatras of cats, whom age could not wither, and whose"
"infinite variety custom could not stale,--and there was the approaching"
marriage of Arachne with a duke to report. And he told her of his
"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"
of tragedy. It was in the nature of a shock to him when Stella's maid
entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”
"“Of course,” said John. “Do you think it 's so damned easy?”"
"“You had better be quick, if you 're coming back to town with me. I'm"
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."

"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back

"NONDRE, PEDRO."
"Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution"
it was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the
"scaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and"
had to be hanged a second time.
"NORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"Served under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman"
"was left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the"
"isthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon ""sent forth to sea two boats to"
"exercise piracy."" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish"
"merchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety"
"into the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a"
"valuable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the"
garrison was in sore need.
"NORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL."
"Born in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of"
"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""

"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"

The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"

"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""
"""Start at the beginning--when you were arrested."""

THE HARBOR MASTER
_By Theodore Goodridge Roberts_
"Author of ""Comrades of the Trails,"" ""Rayton: A Backwoods Mystery,"""
etc.

Goss. Net $1.25; postpaid $1.40_
The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."
Sailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba
his teeth.
"""Are you going with us?"" Boyd inquired."
"""Sure."""
"""See here. Is life one long succession of surprise parties with you?"""
"""Why, I've figgered on this right along."""
"""But the ship is jammed now. There is no room."""
"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"
"telling you, and I'm going to put this deal through, now that I've got"
"it started."" With a half-embarrassed laugh and a complete change of"
"manner, he laid his hand upon Boyd's shoulder, saying: ""Pal, I ain't"
"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.
"""Of course you can come along, old man,"" he responded, heartily. ""We're"
"glad to have you."""
To one who has never witnessed the spring sailing of a Northern
"cannery-tender, the event is well worth seeing; it is one of the"
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"

Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"his coat. He stopped laughing then, by calculated degrees."
"""Sit down--sit down!"" said he wheezily. ""What's your hurry? You haven't"
told me yet what those few 'trifling formalities' are. And how am I to
"know whether--"""
"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."

"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."
"""I don't believe I will,"" Slyne declared, inwardly elated over the"
"winning of that somewhat risky move. ""You don't deserve another chance."

the age of 23.
"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.
"Tried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be ""not guilty."""
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"

"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""

Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.

"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she

the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"

"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.
"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""
"noticed it when I was over."""
"""Is it meant to imply independent means?"""
"""I dare say that idea may be dormant under it somewhere. My wife says"
"the girls like it."""
"""Then your wife, Perry, is a traitor to her sex to make such"
"confessions. Besides, they didn't in my time."""
"""Come, you know, you're a forlorn bachelor. What can you know about it?"""
"""Bachelors, Perry, are the men who know. Which gathers most knowledge"
"from a vivisection, the attentive student or the writhing frog?"""
"""The operator, most of all."""
"""Doubtless."""
"""And that's the woman. Therefore, Oakapple, you're wrong and my wife's"
"right."""
"""The deuce!"" said the Chief Justice. ""I wonder how I ever got any"
"briefs."""
"In the afternoon, when these idlers had one and all set out for the"
"Legislative Assembly, some to work, others still to idle, Mr. Kilshaw"
felt interest enough in the fate of his late henchman to drop in at the
"police office on his way to the same destination. He was well known, and"
no one objected to his walking in and making for the door of the
Superintendent's room. An officer to whom he spoke told him that Ned
"Evans was in custody, and that it was rumoured that some startling"
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
right under the window of his sitting-room. An Indian voice greeted
"him, ""Don' shoot; me killi him."""
"""Who in h---- are you?"" swore Searles, at a present."
"""Don' shoot, me Ahhæta--all same Sharp-Nose--don' shoot--me killi him."""
"""Killi who? Who have you killed? Talk up quick!"""
"""Me killi him. You come--you see."""
By this time the crowd drew in with questions and eager to help. A
"sergeant arrived with a lantern, and the guard laid rude hands on the"
"Crow scout, Sharp-Nose, who was well known. He was standing over the"
"prostrate figure, and continued to reiterate, ""Me killi him."""
"The lantern quickly disclosed the man on the ground to be John Ermine,"
"late scout and fugitive from justice, shot through the heart and dead,"
with his blanket and rifle on the ground beside him. As he looked
"through the window, he had been stalked and killed by the fool whom he"
"would not allow to shake hands with Katherine Searles, and a few moments"
"later, when Sharp-Nose was brought into her presence, between two"
"soldiers, she recognized him when he said, ""Mabeso, now you shake"
"hands."""
"""Yes, I will shake hands with you, Sharp-Nose,"" and half to herself, as"
"she eyed her malevolent friend, she muttered, ""and he kept you to"
"remember me by."""
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little
kindness.
"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was
"forgotten. A maid, Stella's own maid, came in with a message. Miss"
"Stella's compliments, and were Mr. Risca and Mr. Herold having a good"
"supper? She herself was about to drink her egg beaten up in sherry, and"
would be glad if the gentlemen would take a glass of wine with her.
"The young men, accordingly, raised their glasses toward the ceiling and"
"drank to Stella, in the presence of the maid, and gave her appropriate"
messages to take back to her mistress.

days were over. Michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start
building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break
loose.
Wednesday 10:23 A.M.
"""_Polovena decyat_?"" She examined him with her dark eyes."
"""_Da_."" Novosty nodded. ""They will be here at ten-thirty. That is the"
"schedule."""
"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier
"this morning, nobody knew where the money would be taken, not even the"
"Japanese banker Nogami. Still, the instruments were negotiable, leaving"
the possibility of trouble if the timing went sour.
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
"""Why, you owe me twenty."""
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
"""Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's haggle about such a trifle."
What's it matter if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the whole
"bloomin' watch for you?"""
"""Go to hell,"" said Lampert sulkily."
And Simcox went below.
"""To be a sailor is to be a natural born fool,"" said Lampert,"
"addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large, ""and to be on"
"board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd, from the old man down"
"to the cook, is very trying.  It's very trying."""
"The wind took off a little later, but the weather was still thickish."
"""It's like lookin' through a haystack,"" grunted Lampert, ""but there,"
bar an island or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.  And if
"the skipper will crack on, and it a week since we saw the sun, it's"
"the owners' look out, not mine."""
"He spoke with a certain bitterness, as though he would really enjoy"
"being wrecked, in the trust that the _Potluck_ was not insured, and"
"that old Jones would get his certificate cancelled, or at least"
suspended.
"""'Twould give the old ass time to study foreign politics,"" sneered"
"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"

He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"
to Test Pilot Fayburn. A space egg had smashed through the cockpit
Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"
a madman. What had brought about the change? Was he still human or was
he now OUT OF THIS WORLD?
Only time would tell as he daringly laid siege to an important air base
and began using his frightening power to force men and women to serve
his evil purpose.

"seemed to come surging over him like a flood, leaving him speechless,"

As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”

"The tech thought a minute. ""We've never run this gear anywhere"
"but at Radiation, right at Mojave labs, on Earth. Our spacial"

Wilson picked up the interphone and barked a call.
"""Weston? Look, Hugh, can you get over here quick with a couple of your"
top astrogators? We've got a bunch of longhairs with a fancy infrawave
"detector and ranger, but the damned coordinates are set axially with"

He listened to Hugh Weston's reply.
"""Yeah,"" he said then. ""We know where the target is with respect to the"
"ship, but we don't know the spacial attitude of the ship with respect"

"As Wilson hung up the dome flickered, then went into a regular"
_flash-flash-flash_ until something else came unglued and the dome
"went blank. There was shouting and rather heart-felt cussing, and some"
running around again before the dome light came back.
A tech--not the one that had come up before--moved into place alongside
the commodore.
"""Mr. Wilson, sir,"" he said, ""I wonder if--er--That is, sir--er--"""
"""Too lively to be talked about,"" he said. ""I doubt if the regiment"
"isn't going to add itself to the general disaster."""
"""Oh, rot!"" was the young officer's forgetful lapse into disrespect."
"""The regiment will do for the beggars all right. They didn't expect us"
"so soon, I fancy. Just listen! I believe I've frightened them away"
"already. There isn't a sound."""
"Colonel Carmichael lifted his head. True enough, no living thing"
"seemed to move. A profound hush hung in the air, broken only by Mrs."
Cary's pitiful meanings.
"""Oh, Beatrice, Beatrice, where are you?"""
Geoffries turned his stained face to the Colonel's.
"""Beatrice! That's Miss Cary, isn't it? Anything happened to her?"""
Colonel Carmichael shrugged his shoulders with the impatience of a man
whose nerves are overstrained by anxiety.
"""I don't know--we've lost her,"" he said. ""We must do something at"
"once. Heaven alone knows what has happened."""
No one indeed knew what had happened--not even the lonely man who
"waited, revolver in hand, for the final encounter on whose issue hung"
the fortunes of them all.
"Only one knew, and that was Beatrice herself as she stood before the"
"shattered doorway of the Colonel's drawing-room, amidst the debris of"
"wrecked, shot-riddled furniture, face to face with Nehal Singh."
talk such damned bad French.”
Rippley went and touched him on the shoulder:
"“Blotte, old boy; you’re very queer to-night,” he said. “You make me"
feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.”
"Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned to them all:"
“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into
"solitude in the woods, alone with the good darkness round me. This is the"
last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"
"others and can endure only one's own, but because of their quality of"
"loftiness and religion. Strange how all things pass distantly, yet all is"
near; we sit in an omnipresence. It must be God. It must be ourselves as a
part of all things.
"What would my heart, where would I stray?"
Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.
"“DEAR MADELAINE,"
I am called home.
"I leave my rooms and all in them to your care, knowing that they will"
"be in good hands. I leave you also all the money I can spare, to keep"
you in decency and comfort until I return.
"I shall send, early in the day, for the large leather bag which you"
will find labelled and ready by the door.
NOLL.”
And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:
"“DEAR BABETTE,"
I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last
"night I found Madelaine at _The Golden Sun_. She was without home,"
"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"
no honest woman can live; she was without a bed. But her blood is
dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"
alone. She will babble all her news to you--it will be better for her
than babbling it to me.
Tell Horace not to go back to the haunts of his youth. The wine is
"If you reply that men and beasts are different, they will answer that in"
this point they do not recognise the difference. 'Poor beast! let him
live out his little life.' And they will give him grass and water till
he dies.
"This is the exception that I meant, but now, after I have written it, I"
am not so sure. Is it an exception?
CHAPTER XXI
ALL LIFE IS ONE
"'I heard a voice that cried,"
"""Balder the Beautiful"
"Is dead, is dead,"""
And through the misty air
Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
"forthcoming he would cut the throats of all his prisoners, many of them"
"the leading merchants of the town. While waiting for the Governor's reply,"
Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."
"RICHARDSON, NICHOLAS."
"One of Captain Quelch's crew. Taken out of the brigantine _Charles_, and"
tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.
"RIDGE, JOHN."
Of London.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"

"""You mean that you have forsaken Edith and returned to her?"" he"
"observed, raising his brows slightly in surprise."
"""No; don't put it in that way,"" I implored.  ""I have not yet forsaken"
"Edith."""
"He smiled, just a trifle superciliously, I thought."
"""And the Countess is also in possession of this mysterious secret--eh?"""
"""Of that I am not at all certain,"" I replied."
He sniffed in distinct suspicion that what I had told him was not the
"truth.  At the same instant, however, the Countess entered and demanded"
to know the condition of her child.
"""She is much better, madame,"" he answered.  ""Perfect quiet is, however,"
"necessary, and constant observation of the temperature.  To-morrow, or"
"the day after, you may, I think, see her."""
"""Not till then!"" she cried.  ""I cannot wait so long."""
"""But it is necessary.  Your daughter's life hangs upon a single thread."""
"She was silenced, for she saw that argument was useless."
A few minutes later Jean entered with a message from Trepard asking Dick
"and myself to consult with him.  We therefore left the Countess again,"
and passed along the corridor to the room in which my love of long ago
"""They're hostile, whatever they are,"" said Dex. ""Look out: that one's"
"pointing something at you!"""
"One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled"
"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
"""I do not interfere in the councils of the Gitano,"" she cried; ""I am"
"old, but not old enough to desire death!"""
"But more grim and lack-lustre than ever, the face of Sergeant Cardono"
"was turned upon her, and more starrily twinkled the sloe-like eyes"

"Rom are as an open book to me. If they are life, they are life because I"
"will it; if death, then I will the death!"""

"man who could both make that boast, and make it good!"""
She appeared to consider a moment.
"""Save one,"" she added, ""and he is dead!"""
"""How did he die?"" said the Sergeant, his tanned visage like a mask, but"
never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"

"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"trumpet brayed, though a host had scattered in search of a woman's"
face.
"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"

Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.

"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"
"I nodded ‘That will do’ to the twain, and dismissed them; and, they"
"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.
"I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention as I"
rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.
"""I recollect nothing,"" she declared."
"""But you surely remember how you were attacked?""  I urged."
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

the lover has slipped away.”
"“Yes, that is true.”"
"“It really is pretty; you seem to see the pallor of the saint’s face,"
"the circles under her eyes, the relaxation of all her muscles. Then the"
angel is a little joker who stands there smiling at the ecstasy of the
saint.”
"“Yes, that’s true,” said Kennedy; “it is all the more admirable for the"
"very reason that it is tender, sensual, and charming, all at once.”"
"“However, this sort of thing is not healthy,” murmured Cæsar, “this"
kind of vision depletes your life-force. One wants to find the same
"things represented in works of art that one ought to look for in life,"
even if they are not to be found in life.”

Kennedy. “Let us go along.”

for some part at least of what he and I have lost through your--your

A MASTERSTROKE
"Sallie sat down quickly in a cushioned chair, and lay back, trembling"
like a captured bird.
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"
"mere! Let them ride in quest of your lost one, ride like the wind!"""
Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""

THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a

that I was rather proud of those details. If our hostiles out there

they start chasing frightened householders down the streets of the

supposed to have built some ships to specifications stolen in England.
"When launched, they slid out into the bay and tipped over."""
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.

woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?
"Mino continued. ""Therefore I must now either take you into my"
"organization or . . ."" He paused. ""It's that simple. Which, I wonder,"
"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”
"In February, 1686, Ringrose with one hundred men took the town of Santiago"
"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"
"writes: ""My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was"
"necessitated to engage in it or starve."""
"The title of Ringrose's book, first published in 1685, is ""The Dangerous"
"Voyage and Bold Assaults of Captain Bartholomew Sharp and Others."""
Written by Mr. Basil Ringrose.
"Printed for William Crooke, 1685."
"ROACH, PETER."
"When Captain Quelch was captured with his crew, Roach escaped near the"
Cape by Snake Island. He was afterwards captured and thrown into the gaol
"at Salem. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston, and on June 30th,"
"1704, was hanged. At the place of execution Roach disappointed the"
"onlooking crowd, as, instead of the expected and hoped-for repentant"
"speech, ""he seemed little concerned, and said but little or nothing at"
"all."""
"ROB, ALEXANDER."
"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"
He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:
“A most extraordinary person--a most extraordinary _house_!... But I
"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"
"fact, Charlotte, it’s _rather_ thrilling, is it not?”"
to drift away from the standards of his youth in his desire for wealth
and social and scientific prestige. When an exposé of the methods
employed by him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the
"name of ""Weaver"" in the medical world is threatened, it is frustrated"
"through the efforts of the famous doctor's younger brother, Dr. Jim."
"The story is powerful and compelling, even if it uncovers the problems"
and temptations of a physician's career. Perhaps the most important
"character, not even excepting Dr. Weaver and Dr. Jim, is ""The Girl,"""
who plays such an important part in the lives of both men.

THE HILL OF VENUS
_By Nathan Gallizier_

"Lucifer,"" etc."

"name is Villiers. Mr. Alwyn is my guest,--but he is at present very"
"much occupied,--and unless your business is extremely urgent..."""
"""Certainly it is urgent""--said the lady decisively.. ""otherwise I"
"should not have come. And so you are NOT Mr. Alwyn! Well, I thought you"
"couldn't be! Now then, will you have the kindness to tell Mr. Alwyn I"
"am here?"""
"By this time Villiers had recovered his customary self-possession, and"
he met her commanding glance with a somewhat defiant coolness.
"""I am not aware to whom I have the honor of speaking,"" he said"
"frigidly. ""Perhaps you will oblige me with your name?"""
"""My name doesn't in the least matter,"" she replied calmly--""though I"
will tell you afterward if you wish. But you don't seem to understand
"I..._I_ am 'Tiger-Lily'!"""
The situation was becoming ludicrous. Villiers felt strongly disposed
to laugh.
"""I'm afraid I am very ignorant!""--he said, with a humorous sparkle in"
"his blue eyes,--""But really I am quite in the dark as to your meaning."
"Will you explain?"""
"The lady's nose grew deeper of tint, and the look she shot at him had"
quite a killing vindictiveness. With evident difficulty she forced a
smile.
"""Oh, you MUST have heard of me!""--she declared, with a ponderous"
"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
"The grace of her attitude, the intimacy of the scene, the pleasantness"
"of her greeting, made his task hateful."
"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.
"“Emmeline has discovered, Yvonne, that the man--”"
"He got no further. Yvonne rushed to him with a cry of pain, clung to his"
"arm, broke into wild words."
“Don’t say any more--don’t--don’t. Spare me--for pity’s sake. I did not
"eyes without spectacles, I recognized George Hamilton, and almost choked"
myself in smothering a cry.
"Frances turned to me, asking indignantly, ""Why did not you tell me?"""
"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
NOTE
"""The Honest Four-Shilling Piece"" (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E.,"
"p. 306, No. 59) stands for the idealization of childish simplicity"
"and honesty, which after much travail, and despite the ill-will of"
"the ""experienced,"" comes into its deserved own."
XIII
THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
"Jack Norton immensely, although he knew that chances of survival were"
"better with Norton's boorish, interfering presence than without. He was"
"bored, he was angry, he was above all resentful of the time wasted in"
this spacewreck business....
"An orderly tapped Commodore Wilson on the shoulder. ""Message from"
"Terra,"" he said."
"Wilson groaned and reached for the telephone beside his bunk. ""Wilson"
"here,"" he said. ""Go ahead!"""
"""Admiral Stone. Wilson, a new ship is on the way. I want you to get"
"into this thing fully, so I'm briefing you now."""
"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"
"that makes it tick. It's piled in with twine and baling wire, and when"
the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and
"""Attacked!"" she echoed in surprise.  ""No one attacked me."""
"""I did not mean that,"" I answered, rather puzzled at her quick protest."
"""I meant that you were probably aware of the symptoms which preceded"
"your unconsciousness."""
"""I felt a strange dizziness and a curious tightness in the throat and"
chest.  That is all I remember.  All became blank until I opened my eyes
"again and found myself lying here, with these two gentlemen standing at"
my side.  The duration of my unconsciousness did not appear to me longer
"than a few minutes."""
"""Then mademoiselle has no idea of the cause of her strange illness?"""
"inquired Deane in French.  ""None whatever, m'sieur."""
"""Tell us one fact,"" he urged.  ""During the time which elapsed between"
"your parting with M'sieur Ingram and your sudden unconsciousness, did"
"anyone enter the room?"""
"""No one; of that I am absolutely certain."""
"""How were you occupied during that time?"""
"""I was writing a letter."""
"""And before you rose did you feel the curious giddiness?"""
"""No, not until after I stood up.  I tried to shout and attract help, but"
"could not.  Then I reached to press the bell, but stumbled forward, and"
"the next instant I was lost in what seemed to be a dense fog."""
"""Curious!"" ejaculated Trepard, who stood by with folded arms, eagerly"
"_Thersites_ (also based, like Udall's play, on Plautus's _Miles"
"Gloriosus_), or _Calisto and Melibaea_ with its un-English names."
Perhaps that is why it had to wait fifteen years for a successor. Quite
possibly its spectators regarded it as merely a better Interlude than
"usual, without recognizing the precise qualities which made it different"
from _Johan Johan_.
Two quotations will be sufficient to illustrate the opposing characters.

"That ye may esteem him after his worthiness,"
"In these twenty towns, and seek them throughout,"
Is not the like stock whereon to graff a lout.
All the day long is he facing and craking[49]
Of his great acts in fighting and fray-making;
"But when Roister Doister is put to his proof,"
To keep the Queen's peace is more for his behoof.
"If any woman smile, or cast on him an eye,"
Up is he to the hard ears in love by and by:
"And in all the hot haste must she be his wife,"
"Else farewell his good days, and farewell his life!"

poignant twangs disappearing with an electronic click.
"""Are you finding the accommodations adequate?"""
The voice was coming from a speaker carefully integrated into the raw
cypress ceiling.
"""All things considered, we'd sooner be in Philadelphia."" Vance looked"
up.
"""I'm sorry to hear that,"" the voice continued. ""No expense has been"
"spared. My own personal quarters have been placed at your disposal."""
"""Mind telling me who's watching me bathe?"" Eva splashed a handful of"
water at the lens.
"""You have no secrets from me, Dr. Borodin. However, in the interest of"
propriety I have switched off the monitor for the bath. I'm afraid my
"people were somewhat overly zealous, installing one there in the first"
"place."" The voice chuckled. ""But I should think you'd know. I am CEO of"
"the Daedalus Corporation, an organization not unfamiliar to you."""
"""All right,"" she said, ""so where are we?"""
"""Why, you are in the corporation's Hokkaido facility. As my guests."
"Since you two have taken such an interest in this project, I thought it"
“Yes; that’s true. She is too much of a prize beauty.”
“That is the defect in the Yankee women; they have no character. The
"weight of tradition might be fatal to industry and modern life, but it"
is the one thing that creates the spirituality of the old countries.
"Beyond contradiction American women have intelligence, beauty, energy,"
"attractive flashes, but they lack that particular thing created by"
centuries: character. At times they have very charming impulses. Have
you heard the story about Prince Torlonia’s wife?”
“No.”
"“Well, Torlonia’s present wife was an American girl worth millions, who"
"came with letters to the prince. He took her about Rome, and at the end"
"of some days he said to her, supposing that the beautiful American had"
the intention of marrying: ‘I will introduce some young noblemen to
you’; and she answered: ‘Don’t introduce anybody to me; because you
please me more than anybody’; and she married him.”
“It was a pretty impulse.”
"“Yes, Americans do things like that on the spur of the moment. But if"
"you saw a Spanish woman behave that way, it would seem wrong to you.”"
Chattering amicably they came to the Piazza Esedra.
“Would you care to have lunch with me?” said Kennedy.
“Just what I was going to propose to you.”
“I eat alone.”
chorale melodies are found in the _Hymnary_ but use is made of
"a number of his harmonizations. See 539, 545, 556, 557, 564,"
566.
7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.

THE WHAT-SHALL-I-DO GIRL
"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated by Jessie Gillespie. Net $1.25;"
postpaid $1.40_
"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
man at my time of life! Do you realize that I am twice her age?”
"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"
"the whole of your life before you. Time, my dear boy, is a marvellous"

astonishing continent of Australia--”
John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.
"“I'm not going to the damned continent,” said he."
"""Well, here goes for food!"" he said, as though he were going to require"
all his energy for the task of eating.
Why had she written? There was nothing to prevent her speaking to him. He
"had, after all, been sitting on the doorstep when she emerged from her"
room and passed him. Had she foreseen that the good comedian could not
"contain himself, but would surely let a third person into the secret?"
"Why probe or question further? The actor did not eat much, but he looked"
"very happy. So the note must have said yes, must have been a promise;"
perhaps she would not tantalize him further.

"A few days later, they were going to leave. They would travel together,"
and that would be the end.
"I might have pitied them both, for though life is good, life is stern. One"
"result at any rate was accomplished. She had not sent for him in vain, nor"
had he come in vain.
That was the end of the act. But there were more acts to come--many more.
"She had lost much: having been ravished, she gave herself away; why be"
"niggardly now? And this is the destiny of her type, that they lose"
"increasingly much, retaining ever less; what need to hold back now? The"
ground has been completely shifted: from half-measures to the immolation
_Sale._

"Treasury or by the Lords of the Admiralty, subject in either case to"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."

"The following is the evidence given by Dr. J. C. Bose, C. S. I., C. I."

"volume XX, Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners:"
WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
"83, 627 (I) _Method of recruitment._--The first question on which I have"
been asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment. I
think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
"qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,"
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.
"19. The Captors shall, with all practicable Speed after the captured"
"Ship is brought into Port, bring Three or Four of the Principal Persons"
belonging to the captured Ship before the Judge of the Court or some

on the Standing Interrogatories.
"The Preparatory Examinations on the Standing Interrogatories shall, if"
"possible, be concluded within Five Days from the Commencement thereof."

"20. After the Return of the Monition, the Court shall, on Production of"
"the Preparatory Examinations and Ship Papers, proceed with all"
convenient Speed either to condemn or to release the captured Ship.
[Sidenote: Further Proof.]
"21. Where, on Production of the Preparatory Examinations and Ship"
"Papers, it appears to the Court doubtful whether the captured Ship is"
"good Prize or not, the Court may direct further Proof to be adduced,"
"either by Affidavit or by Examination of Witnesses, with or without"
"Pleadings, or by Production of further Documents; and on such further"
Proof being adduced the Court shall with all convenient Speed proceed to
Adjudication.
"[Sidenote: Custody, &c. of Ships of War.]"
"22. The foregoing Provisions, as far as they relate to the Custody of"
"the Ship, and to Examination on the Standing Interrogatories, shall not"
apply to Ships of War taken as Prize.

"outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And"
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the _huldres_
"disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the"
"wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,"
"and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."

A favorite jewel among the treasures of the underground world

"Eidsvold, told by an old peasant woman). Often appearing in"
"legend proper as the tarn-cap, it here finds a more humble place"
"in everyday life, neither ennobled by legendary dignity, nor"
diversified by the rich incident of fairy-tale. The entertaining
picture here afforded of its powers shows them all the more
clearly.

THE CHILD OF MARY
"Far, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple."
Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so
poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her
"the greater number of her clothes, hers was the heavier sack. Thus had"
they shifted their burdens; what burdens would they carry in the future?
"She was, after all, no longer a schoolmistress, and perhaps he was no"
longer with the theater or the films.
"I watched those two crossing rocky, mountainous ground, bare ground, with"
not a tree anywhere except a few stunted junipers; far away near the ridge
"murmured the little Reisa. Those two had put their possessions together,"
"were walking together; at the next halt they would be man and wife, and"
take only one room because it was cheaper.
"Suddenly I started up and, moved by some impulse of human sympathy--nay,"
"of duty--I wanted to run across to her, talk to her, say a word of"
"warning: ""Don't go on!"" I could have done it in a few minutes--a good"
"deed, a duty...."
They disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.
Her name was Ingeborg.

"And now I, too, must wander on again, for I am the last at the Tore Peak"
"farm. The season is wearing on, and this morning it snowed for the first"

"on one of the possible, and probable, lines of development of Croce's"
"philosophy; which, however, will not become actual until the historical"
"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently
"to recreate the life of which these are but the dead spoils, the"
"accumulated vestiges, by the same process by which history re-kindles"
"the old chronicles into new, contemporary life. That such a development"
"is implied in Croce's own theory of history can hardly be questioned,"
"though, when realized, it will undoubtedly react on more than one point"
of Croce's logic.

"""Nothing to report,"" announced Barracombe, as Aubyn relieved him as"
"officer of the watch. ""A jolly fine night. I shouldn't wonder if we"
"were favoured by a visit from a Zeppelin or two."""
"""A pretty jamb in the harbour,"" said Terence, giving a quick glance"
"at the maze of vessels. ""Fortunately, I hear, we've several seaplanes"
"at our disposal."""
Barracombe wished his relief good-night and descended the ladder to
retire to the seclusion of his cabin and sleep the sleep of
"exhaustion, for he had had a strenuous time before the cruiser left"
Devonport.
During the first hour nothing unusual occurred. The midshipman of the
"watch reported ""Rounds all correct, sir,"" to which Aubyn replied with"
"the stereotyped ""Very good."" Across the harbour came the faint hail"
of the Night Guard as the picquet boat studiously visited every
vessel within the limits of the breakwater.
The masthead light of the flagship began to blink. A signalman on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge snatched up a slate."
"""General call, sir,"" he announced."
"Deftly the man took down the message, then hurried to the chart-room"
to decipher the code.
"""Submarine E27 reports three hostile aeroplanes passing S.W. by W."
"Position eleven miles N.N.E. of North Goodwin."""
"The warning was a brief one, for hardly had the ship's company been"
hysteric desire to talk loudly and hide his chagrin; and he turned at
"the sound of Fosse’s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal."
"Fosse in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the"
discussion round about him:
"“In the arts,” he was saying, “woman does not, cannot, shine. She only"
exists--on sufferance. A woman’s province----”
Myre had strolled towards the voice:
"“I am flattered to find,” said he, “that Mr. Fosse has been reading me."
He is right. A woman’s province is to be beautiful; and if she write
at all she may write of the nursery--of the domesticities. A woman
has not the experiences of life--she writes only from intuition. She
cannot experience the emotions of a man--cannot describe all shades of
life--is too careful of her skirts to have been on the heights and in
the gutters----”
Lovegood coughed:
"“Never,” said he, with big deliberate voice--“never shall I again"
approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.”
Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:
"“A woman,” said he, “cannot be in the thrash and fume of life. She only"
peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the doings of the world.
She has not physical strength----”
Somebody coughed:
“Tra-la-lee!” said he--“opera--bouffe--bouffe--bouffe.”
With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during
the campaign.

"""Going to Havana?"""
"This, too, I admitted."
"""Well, there's a feller by the desk who missed the steamer, and he"
"hoped--er----"""
"""We'd take him over,"" Tommy supplied the halting words. ""Where is he?"""
"Turning, we easily distinguished the man by his timid glances in our"
direction.
"""Whiz-bang,"" Tommy whispered. ""What the deuce would you call it, Jack?"""
"Except for his age, that might have been sixty, he was most comical to"
"look upon--in stature short and round, suggesting kinship with a gnome."
"His head seemed too large for the body, yet this might have been because"
"it carried a plenteous shock of straw-colored hair, with mustache and"
"beard to match. He was attired in ""knickers"" and pleated jacket, that"
"looked as if he'd slept in them, and his fat legs were knock-kneed. On"
the floor about his feet lay almost every conceivable type and age of
"traveling bag, with the inevitable camera."
"""What's his name?"" Tommy asked, not that that would have made any"
difference if his passport were in order.
"""Registered as 'Monsieur Dragot, of Roumania,'"" the proprietor answered."
"""Roumania!"" Tommy looked at me. ""Let's go meet him, Jack."""
"Monsieur Dragot turned out to be the original singed cat, for assuredly"
he possessed more attractive qualities inside than were exteriorly
"suppose both of you will have to one of these days, when you get older;"
but I don't like to think of it.”
"“I don't believe I shall ever marry, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
“Why?”
Herold looked out to sea for a wistful instant. “Because one can't marry
"a dream, my dear.”"
"“I've married hundreds,” said Stella, softly."
"If they had been alone together, they would have talked dreams and"
"visions and starshine and moonshine, and their conversation would"
have been about as sensible and as satisfactory to each other and as
intelligible to a third party as that of a couple of elves sitting on
adjacent toadstools; but elves don't talk in the presence of a third
"party, even though he be John Risca and Great High Belovedest. And"
"Stellamaris, recognizing this instinctively, turned her eyes quickly to"
Risca.
"“And you, dear--will you ever marry?”"
"“Never, by Heaven!” cried John, with startling fervency."
Stella reached out both her hands to the two men who incorporated the
"all in all of her little life, and each man took a hand and kissed it."
"“I don't want to be horrid and selfish,” she said; “but if I lost either"
"of you, I think it would break my heart.”"
The men exchanged glances. John repeated his query: “Do you think it's
say that the woman only suffers in such cases; the man never.  Whether
that rule proves always true will be shown in this strange story of my
own love.
"She drew her hand away slowly, but forcibly, saying:"
"""You cannot love two women.  Already you have shown a preference for a"
"wife of your own people."""
"""It is all over between us,"" I protested.  ""Mine was a mere passing"
"fancy, engendered, I think, by the loneliness I suffered when I lost"
"you."""
"""Ah,"" (she smiled sadly), ""that is all very well!  A woman, when once"
"played false by the man she loves and trusts, is never the"
"same--_never_!"""
"""Then am I to understand, Yolande, that you refuse to pardon me, or to"
"accept my affection?"""
"""I have already pardoned you,"" she faltered; ""but to accept the love you"
"once withdrew from me without just reason is, I regret to say,"
"impossible."""
"""You speak coldly, as though you were refusing a mere invitation to"
"dinner, or something of no greater importance,"" I protested.  ""I offer"
"you my whole heart, my love--nay, my life;"" and I held her hand again,"
"looking straight into those wonderful eyes, now so calm, so serious,"
that my gaze wavered before them.
"Slowly she shook her head, and her trembling breast rose and fell again."

of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From

"questions you have, I would be--"""
"""Okay, how's this. What do you expect to get out of me?"""
"He laughed. ""Why nothing at all. Our reunion here is merely intended to"
serve as a tutorial. To remind you and others how upsetting I find
"intrusions into my affairs."""
"""Then how about starting off this 'tutorial' with a look at your new"
"plane?"" Vance glanced around. ""Guess I should call it _Daedalus_."""
"""_Daedalus I _and_ II. _There actually are two prototypes, although"
only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic regime.
"Yes, I expected the _Daedalus_ would intrigue you. You are a man of"
"insatiable intellectual appetite."""
"""I'm not sure that's necessarily a compliment."""
"""It wasn't necessarily meant to be. Sometimes curiosity needs to be"
"curbed. But if we can agree on certain matters, I shall enjoy providing"
"you a personal tour, to satisfy that curiosity. You are a man who can"
well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic
"coup."""
"The old boy's finally gone off the deep end, Vance told himself."

referring to the fact you've got them exactly where you want them. The

Not many minutes had passed after their perilous descent when a sphere
"of fire shot from the clouds, followed by a crash as if the earth had"
"been rent in twain, and the western tower of Astura was seen toppling"
into the sea.
"Bye and bye sea and land reflected a crimson glow, which steadily"
"increased, fanned by the gale, until it shone far out upon the sea."
"Astura was in flames, the funeral pyre of the Frangipani."

THE QUEST
"As the world grew gray with waking light, Francesco came from the"
woods and heard the noise of the sea in the hush that breathed in the
dawn. The storm had passed over the sea and a vast calm hung upon the
lips of the day. In the east a green streak shone above the hills. The
sky was still aglitter with sparse stars. An immensity of gloom
brooded over the sea.
"Gaunt, wounded, triumphant, Francesco rode up beneath the banners of"
"the dawn, eager yet fearful, inspired and strong of purpose. Wood and"
hill slept in a haze of mist. The birds were only beginning in the
"thickets, like the souls of children yet unborn, calling to eternity."
"Beyond in the cliffs, San Nicandro, wrapped round with night, stood"
silent and sombre athwart the west.

"With this urgency in mind, I suggested to Frances and Betty that I"
"cross to Calais alone, regardless of the weather, leaving them at Dover"
"till my return. But they would not be left behind, so we all set sail on"
a blustery morning and paid for our temerity with a day of suffering. In
"Calais we posted our letters, having learned that a messenger would leave"
"that same day for Paris, and two days later we returned to Dover."
"Our journey home was made in the rain, Bettina sleeping with her head on"
my shoulder a great part of the way. And I enjoyed the rain even more
than I had enjoyed the sunshine.
"We reached London nearly a week before the king's return, so that nothing"
was known of our journey at court.

"have involved the getting of money for the privy purse; that is, for the"
"king's personal use, for out of it the courtesans were fed and gambling"
debts were paid.

The United Fruit Company is by far the greatest agricultural enterprise
the world has ever known. Its fruit plantations constitute a farm half a
mile wide and more than seven hundred miles long. All of its farm lands
exceed in area the 1332 square miles which constitute the sovereign
"State of Rhode Island. On these farms are more than 25,000 head of live"
stock. This agricultural empire is traversed by nearly 1000 miles of
railroad. To carry the fruits from the plantations to the seaports there
are employed 100 locomotives and 3000 freight cars. An army of nearly
"40,000 men is employed in this new and mammoth industry. The republics"
of Central America were inland nations before the United Fruit Company
made gardens of the low Caribbean coast lands and created from the
"virgin wilderness such ports as Barrios, Cortez, Limon and Bocas del"
Toro.

of Don Ramon Garcia's house. I cannot see my namesake suffer. Tell him
that two thousand _duros_ is the price up till noon. After that it will
"have risen to four thousand, and by three of the afternoon, if the money"
be not paid into the treasury of the only absolute and Catholic
"sovereign (in the present instance my breeches pocket), I shall be"
reluctantly compelled to shoot one dozen of the leading citizens of the
township of Sarria. Let a strong guard accompany this young man till he
"returns from carrying his message."""

HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECT OF THE STORY.
WE are now coming to the most important part of the question of
"Story-Telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually"
"leading, and that is the Effects of these stories upon the child, apart"
"from the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would"
"in itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling. But, since I"
have urged upon teachers the extreme importance of giving so much time

picking up his hat and coat he walked slowly to the door. Here he halted

"it; however, even in some of the stories themselves, this explanation is"
used to clear certain difficulties; however opposed eternal love may be
"to one of the central doctrines of Buddhism, it seems to me that the"
very essence of this story is the belief that love does not die with the
"body, that it lives for ever and ever, through incarnation after"
incarnation. Such a story is the very cry of the agony of humanity.
"'Love is strong as death; many waters cannot quench love;' ay, and love"
"is stronger than death. Not any dogmas of any religion, not any"
"philosophy, nothing in this world, nothing in the next, shall prevent"
him who loves from the certainty of rejoining some time the soul he
loves.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE FOREST OF TIME
'The gate of that forest was Death.'
There was a great forest. It was full of giant trees that grew so high
and were so thick overhead that the sunshine could not get down below.
"And there were huge creepers that ran from tree to tree climbing there,"
"But now science has learned a new wisdom, to look only at what it can"
"see, to leave vain imaginings to children and idealists, certain always"
that the truth is inconceivably more beautiful than any dream.
"Science with us has gained her freedom, but the soul is still in bonds."
Only in Buddhism has this soul-freedom been partly gained. How beautiful
"this is, how full of great thoughts, how very different to the barren"
"materialism it has often been said to be, I have tried to show."
I believe myself that in this teaching of the laws of righteousness we
"have the grandest conception, the greatest wisdom, the world has known."
I believe that in accepting this conception we are opening to ourselves
"a new world of unimaginable progress, in justice, in charity, in"
"sympathy, and in love."
"I believe that as our minds, when freed from their bonds, have grown"
"more and more rapidly to heights of thought before undreamed of, to"
"truths eternal, to beauty inexpressible, so shall our souls, when freed,"
"as our minds now are, rise to sublimities of which now we have no"
conception.
"Let each man but open his eyes and see, and his own soul shall teach him"
marvellous things.

"satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blasé, twentieth"

the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the
"reader to feel, after finishing ""Spacehounds of IPC,"" that travel"

CHAPTER I
The IPV _Arcturus_ Sets Out for Mars
"A narrow football of steel, the Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ stood"
upright in her berth in the dock like an egg in its cup. A hundred feet
"across and a hundred and seventy feet deep was that gigantic bowl, its"
walls supported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock and
for a final check-up on directions.
They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically
sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at
"eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering"
such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their
"course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million"
miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander
Stone's night operator.
The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of
the solar system was on.
CHAPTER II
_The Pipe-like Men_
Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day
"(morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in"
space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance
"off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship,"
"which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling"
faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.
"Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no"
larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of
"Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its"
outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks.

"30. In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context, the following"
"wound communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from"
septicæmia mainly due to absorption from the surface of that membrane
(_Pleural septicæmia_).
"No. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt"
can exist that both rectum and bladder were perforated.
"(180*) _Injury to the cæcum and ascending colon._--Boer,"
"wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his"
back.
"_Entry_ (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1"
"inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; _exit_, in back,"
on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches
from that point.
Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
"was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent"
by train a distance of twenty-five miles.
When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
"follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,"
especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
"furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,"
"entirely thoracic, 30."
"Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and"
"motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial"
oedema and emphysema.
Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:
“I don’t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth’s work is a snap better
than Caroline Baddlesmere’s; and he’s prigged a lot of her ideas----”
"Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque literary"
"attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long fingers,"
"legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the thirties, and,"
"rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:"
"“My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that Caroline"
Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man’s humour--to say nothing of
that certain something of subtle atmosphere that is called genius....
You really ought not to give me the trouble of reiterating these simple
truths.... You compel me to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker
on a race-course----”
"He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering in"
Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte--Andrew in very much crushed and
"wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably shabby, Doome well"
groomed.
Bartholomew Doome laughed:
"“Yes,” said he, “yes, yes--I heard what Aubrey was saying; but Aubrey"
"is a poet, not a critic.”"
Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.
But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte. He smote
him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:
"that day, despite the fact that Big George, bruised, ragged, and torn,"
doubled his force of pickets and took personal charge of them.
"That night, under glaring headlines, the evening papers told the story,"
"reporting one fisherman fatally hurt, one striker dead of a gunshot"
"wound, and many others injured."
CHAPTER XVIII
WILLIS MARSH SPRINGS A TRAP
"The ensuing days were strenuous ones for the partners, working as they"
"did, with a crippled force and under constant guard. Riot was in the"
"air, and violence on every side. By the police, whose apathy"
disappeared only when an opportunity occurred of arresting the men they
"were supposed to protect, they were more handicapped than helped. The"
appearance of a fisherman at any point along the water-front became a
sure signal for strife.
"Day by day the feeling on both sides grew stronger, till the non-union"
"men were cemented together in a spirit of bitterest indignation, which"
materially lessened their zeal for work. Every act of violence
"intensified their rage. They armed themselves, in defiance of orders,"
"tossed restraint to the winds, and sought the slightest opportunity of"
wreaking vengeance upon their enemies. Nor were the rioters less
"determined. Authority, after all, is but a hollow shell, which, once"
"broken, is quickly disintegrated. Fierce engagements took place,"

"is in some ways 'before his time', notably in his rejection of the"
Morality abstractions.]
[Footnote 48: sweet.]
CHAPTER IV
RISE OF COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
"No great discernment is required to see that, after the appearance of"
"_Johan Johan_, all that was needed for the complete development of"
comedy was the invention of a well-contrived plot. For reasons already
"indicated, Interludes were naturally deficient in this respect. Nor were"
the Moralities and Bible Miracles much better: their length and
"comprehensive themes were against them. There were the Saint Plays, of"
which some still lingered upon the stage; these offered greater
"possibilities. But here, again, originality was limited; the"
"_dénouement_ was more or less a foregone conclusion. Clearly, one of two"
things was wanted: either a man of genius to perceive the need and to
"supply it, or the study of new models outside the field of English"
"drama. The man of genius was not then forthcoming, but by good fortune"
the models were stumbled upon.
"We say stumbled upon, because the absence of tentative predecessors and"
"of anything approaching an eager band of successors, suggests an"
unpreparedness for the discovery when it came. Thus _Calisto and
"Melibaea_ (1530), an imitation of a Spanish comedy of the same name,"
conveyed no meaning. And then sleep descended and brought entire
oblivion.
VIII
HOME ON LEAVE
"""I have several times expressed the thought that in our day the"
"feeling of patriotism is an unnatural, irrational, and harmful"
"feeling, and a cause of a great part of the ills from which mankind"
"is suffering; and that, consequently, this feeling should not be"
"cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the contrary, be"
"suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men."""
(TOLSTOY.)
A change had come over us all. Instead of long spells of dreary silence
"interrupted by outbursts of irritability, by grumbling and by violent"
"quarrels over nothing, there was animated conversations and sometimes"
"even gaiety. Our talk was all about one subject--not about peace, for we"
had abandoned all hope of peace and hardly ever thought of it--but about
"leave. We had been waiting for seventeen months when, without warning, a"
leave allotment was assigned to our unit. About half a dozen men were
going every day and no one knew whose turn would come next. We were full
"of intense excitement and glad expectation, but also of anxiety in case"
something should happen to stop our leave altogether.
I made up my mind to enjoy myself thoroughly. I would see parents and

ANTIMONII ET POTASSII TARTARS--ANTIMONY AND POTASSIUM TARTRATE--TARTAR
EMETIC
"DERIVATION.--Make a white paste with cream of tartar, antimony trioxide"
"and water. Set aside 24 hours, boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, transparent crystals of the rhombic system,"
"becoming opaque and white on exposure to the air, or a white granular"
"powder without odor and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable,"
"metallic taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5 gr.; pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1"
"gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ gr. As an emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1"
to 2 gr.
"ACTIONS.--Tartar emetic is a systemic and local emetic, a diaphoretic,"
cardiac and arterial sedative and a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a
"powerful waste producer and stimulates the secretions of the stomach,"
"intestines, salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large doses cause"
"nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic doses are followed by"
"vomiting (in animals that can vomit), serious blood purging, great"
"depression of the circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and"
death. Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.
the tincture of aconite with other colic mixture; in congestion of the
"bowels or liver, or in congestion of any part, small repeated doses are"
better than large ones. It is also advantageously used in lung
disorders.
AETHER--ETHER--PURE ETHER
"A liquid composed of about 96 per cent, by weight, of absolute ether or"
"ethyl oxide, and about 4 per cent of alcohol containing a little water."
DERIVATION.--Prepared by distillation of alcohol with sulphuric acid.
There are two steps in the production of ether; sulphorvinic acid and
water are formed in the first step. Sulphorvinic acid is then further
acted upon by alcohol. The distillate is freed from water by agitation
with calcium oxide and chloride and subjected to redistillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A transparent, colorless, mobile liquid, having a"
characteristic odor and a burning and sweetish taste. Ether is highly
"volatile and inflammable; its vapor, when mixed with air and ignited,"
"explodes violently. Miscible in all proportions with alcohol,"
"chloroform, benzine, benzol, fixed and volatile oils. Ether is a solvent"
"for fats, oils, alkaloids, resins, gutta percha and guncotton. Upon"
evaporation ether should have no residue. Ether vapor is heavier than
air and consequently etherization should never be done above a light or
fire.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 ms. to 1 dr."
and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on
"the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,"
with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of fæcal matter was
"visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal"
contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were
sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured
"in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the"
"belly, after washing with boiled water."
Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median
"basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected"
hypodermically.
"The patient did not rally, and died twelve hours after the"
operation.
"(167*) Wounded at Graspan. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), midway"
"between the umbilicus and pubes; _exit_, 1 inch to the left of"
the fifth lumbar spine. The patient was seen on the third day
"in the following condition: in great pain, expression extremely"
"anxious, vomiting constantly. Pulse 150 running, respirations"
"48. Temperature 100°, sweating freely. Great distension,"
"rigidity, and general tenderness of immobile abdomen. No"
improvement followed the administration of brandy and
"hypodermic injection of strychnine 1/30 grain, and operation"
was deemed hopeless.
In the evening the patient was apparently dying. Face blue and
"sunken and covered with sweat, eyes dull, speechless, pulse"
"imperceptible, restlessness extreme, bowels acting"
"involuntarily, no urine in bladder."
detachment. But for us it is a matter of life and death. Upon its issue
depends the question whether our grandchildren are to live in a happier
"world, or are to exterminate each other by scientific methods, leaving"
perhaps to negroes and Papuans the future destinies of mankind.
APPENDIX
THE CONWAY MEMORIAL LECTURESHIP
"At a general meeting of the South Place Ethical Society, held on October"
"22, 1908, it was resolved, after full discussion, that an effort should"
"be made to establish a series of lectures, to be printed and widely"
"circulated, as a permanent Memorial to Dr. Conway."
Moncure Conway’s untiring zeal for the emancipation of the human mind
"from the thraldom of obsolete or waning beliefs, his pleadings for"
sympathy with the oppressed and for a wider and profounder conception of
"human fraternity than the world has yet reached, claim, it is urged, an"
offering of gratitude more permanent than the eloquent obituary or
reverential service of mourning.
The range of the lectures (of which the thirteenth is published
herewith) must be regulated by the financial support accorded to the
scheme; but it is hoped that sufficient funds will be eventually
forthcoming for the endowment of periodical lectures by distinguished
"public men, to further the cause of social, political, and religious"
"freedom, with which Dr. Conway’s name must ever be associated."

He do that often?
Every time he feels old.
He's in trouble.
"No, he's not."
Are you crazy?
You nearly drowned.
"Hush, child."
Have you lost your senses?
Is that the way to speak to your grandfather in front of a stranger?

Tom Magnum.

Fine.
-This is a nice place.

"And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires."
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.
Ramone will paint you up right.
"Hey, anything you want!"
"- You know, like a flame job."
- No thanks...
Maybe ghost flames!
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?
"Oh, honey, look."
Von Dutch.
"OK, no."
"We're gonna be going now, OK?"
Ow!
"A little somethin' to remember us by, OK?"

PHILIP:
"All right, the good stuff."
"Philip, I've, er..."
I got something special for you.
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I just sort of assumed it.
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.
"Oh, God."
She can be such a pain in the ass.
"Anyway, here's to us."
Cheers.
Philip.
"Seems like it's just you and me left now, Norm, huh?"
"Oh, hey."
I forgot to tell you.
I saw this the other day.
Hmm?
"The guy you were supposed to do the journalism piece on, that snake?"
It seems he took his own life.
- Jesus.
- Who is it?
Who's that?
IKE:
What's he called?
PHILIP:
"Josh Fawn, the writer."
"I mean, I'm glad he's dead and all, but..."

Picking up the new car!
"You can`t wait, can you?"
"Hi there, Ed!"

Look at him.
He can`t wait.
"So, did you bring your trade-in?"
"Yes, a guy just took it away a few seconds ago."

We were afraid the new car hadn`t come in yet.

"A burger, fries and a Coke."
How is the lemon pudding?
-Homemade.
-l'll give it a shot.
-To go.
-You got it.
"Say, why is this called The Floyd Diner instead of Floyd's Diner?"
"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?
"Floyd, New York."
"Like Clyde, New Jersey."
Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
"After law school, I headed where?"
"Floyd, New York."

Gil-Ga...
Gil?
Gil Da Ran?
Da Ran...
Did your wedding get called off?
He said with his own lips that he wasn't my brother-in-law!
Is that why he's not answering my phone calls?
That's because...
Yoon Jae has a situation right now.
He even insulted me!
Stupid!
He pretended he didn't know me.
He totally dissed dad!
-That wasn't Yoon Jae who did that...!
-Then...
Then who is the person I saw earlier?
And who's the one that acted like he didn't know me?
That was Yoon Jae.
"It's over, it's over."
It's over.
Oh my!
"It's our son-in-law, Yoon Jae!"
Did you eat the dumplings?
Do you know what was inside those?
Huh?
Try to guess.
-Meat?
-No...
-Shrimp?
-No!
"Here, watch."
"It wriggles around, and when you catch it, it escapes."
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
-John.
"-Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"Tell me, does Mr. Bourne still drop in?"
"Not quite as often, but often."
"Let me know if he comes in, will you?"
"Oh, there you are, Alec."
-I thought you had to make a phone call.
"-I did, darling."
Nobody home.
I was just asking John about my compact.
"-You remember, I lost it last night."
"-No, I don't remember."
I think the reward will help.
"It's square and gold-ribbed, isn't it?"
That's it.
"Be an angel, John."
Do your best for me.
"Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"All right, darling, I'm all yours."
"-Good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
"Well, good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-John.
-A table?
"No, I'll go to the bar, John."
"Oh, Mr. Bourne, Miss Lorrison asked about you."
Isabel Lorrison?
I didn't know she was in town.
She's in the Candle Room with Mr. Dawning.
"[clears throat] Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt."
Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.

And so you have.
"[door opens, closes]"
Mr. Perkins will see you now.
[sighs]
- Fitzgerald.
- Mr. Perkins.
"There you are, my boy."
Have a seat.
[clears throat]
"Thank you for, uh..."
for seeing me.
"So, I've given it a read."
It's longer.
And quite different.
"Don't forget your hat this time, Mr. Fitzgerald."
"Oh, Miss Hunnicutt."

[laughing] [gasping]
"Oh, my Lord, will you look at that?"
"It's beautiful, Zelda."
I ain't never seen one like it.
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.
Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.
Hyo-jin.
Baby.
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
"Drop that, baby."
Don't cry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
Quick!

This is all the work of that Jap.
"Ever since we went to his house, my body's been in pain."
I'm burning up.
I'm seeing things.
A man's face comes out of the wall.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Okay.
"Hey, how about Diana Krall?"
"Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD."
Do you mind bringing it back to him?
Not at all.
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.
No problem.
"Hey, this is a cool, little CD player."
"Oh, thanks. lt was a gift from your-- lt was a gift."
Perfect.
is there anything else Charlie left behind?
Just me.
My brother's a fool.
No argument here.
-That is a very effective negligée.
-Thank you.
-Was it a gift?
-No.
"-As a matter of fact, I bought it myself."
"-Oh, good."
-How long ago?
-What?
"Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it."
"Alan, don't go there."
"Oh, I wasn't going anywhere."
It's just that--
-Nothing.
More kissing.
"-Okay, okay."
What exactly is bothering you?
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
- Dr Tremaine at the Meredith Hospital.
"We should talk to him, see if he remembers Crowley."
If he knows what happened to him.
The Meredith's not far from here.
Why don't you go?
Are you sure?
"Don't worry, I'll look after her."
(Rings bell)
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a Dr Tremaine.
I'm afraid Dr Tremaine no longer works here.
"- The hospital's being shut down, I'm sorry."
- I...
I...
"Sorry, Mr...?"
Croft.
Andrew Croft.
"Mr Croft, I'm Susan Gray."
I'm trying to trace one of his patients from the war.
"Are there any records, addresses, anything?"
- What name was it?
- A Malcolm Crowley.
"I think you'd better come inside, Mrs Gray."
Damn.
"You gain weight, Hill?"
"No, it was too much beer."
"Hey, puke on me, and I'll leave you right here."
All right.
Adams?
"Yo, Adams, come on, man."
Get up.
- I'll get some lemonade for you!
"- No, I don't want it!"
"Don't be silly, Mimì."
"Drink some, it'll do you good."
"- Here's a wet handkerchief, is that better?"
- Yes.
"I'm sorry if I made you mad, it's all my fault."
- Does your tummy hurt?
- A bit.
"- Does it really, really hurt?"
"- And if I give you a little kiss, will it still hurt?"
- I don't know.
"Shall we try, then?"
"Kids, come on, cut it out!"
Here's your lemonade.
"- No, I don't want it!"
- Come on.
- You don't want it?
- Don't be silly now.
- No!
"- Bonsoir, Monsieur!"
Excuse me...
- C'est complet!
"- Ah, no..."
- C'est complet.
Does a Mr. Raffaele D'Amore live here?
He has a moustache.
"Oui, il demeure ici, mais il n'est pas rentré."
- He's come in?
Now?
"- No, il n'est pas encore rentré."
"- Ah, he's not back yet."

"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
"Mm-hm, when's your curfew?"
I don't have one.
[CHUCKLES]
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
"Hmm, for how long?"
Couple of weeks.
[CHUCKLES]
Seriously?
"Yeah, we've got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."

Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.
Henry!
Hi!
Come in.
I want you to meet my parents.
I never smoked weed.
Marijuana.
Thank you for the clarification.
And I've never had a drink.
Filipino parents are very strict.
What time would you like me to bring your daughter home?
We haven't said she can go out with you yet.
"Uh, how do you two know each other?"
It's really coming along.
And cute too.
Give it a try.
"Testing, testing."
Hello.
"Argh, I don't believe it."

Are you crazy?
Her window's wide open!

-Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
"When I went to get the Thorazine I had him stay with her, and...."
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke is dead.
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God!"
"Yeah, I know."
Yes.

Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.

"I know, she told me."
"Um, Tracey's asleep."
She's in bed.
Already?
Is she okay?
What's wrong?
She waited for you to call all day.
She's drawing things I don't understand and waking up at night.
"No, she's not okay."
Is there anything I can do?
"Let's talk about this another time, okay?"
I'll tell her you called.
Okay.
Nathan.
Nathan!
Nathan.
"Listen, I came to apologize for this morning."
I was a little heavy-handed and I wanted to apologize.
I have something to show you not far from here.

I'm goin'!
Ooh.
I'm goin'!
"Hey, you guys... what do you say I propose a toast?"

You... really let yourself go.
"Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form?"
"No, I'm actually, uh, teaching my daughter some self-defense."
Holy...
"Holy shit, man."
I'm training my daughter too.
"Hey, what do you know?"
"Hey, look at her."
Look at her over there.
"Look, look, look."
Oh!
Amazing.
"Hey, she's pretty too, huh?"
"Like her old man, huh?"
"- Well, it's really nice seeing you, Bob."

You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.
"Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes."

Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.
It's not really enough to build a relationship on.
"Oh, we gotta talk."
- You gotta show me your tricks.
Please.
- I tried that.
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
"You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man."
"Oh, take a car wash, hippie."
"Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!"
Whoo!
That's your color!
"- Yellow, baby."
- Mmm.
You smokin' hot!
There he is.
"Oh, my gosh!"
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
- Doc?
Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.
"No, no, no, no, it's true!"
He's a real racing legend.
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Fabulous?
I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.
"I mean, have you ever seen him race?"
"No, but I wish I could have."
They say he was amazing!
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

Ready.
Aim.

"Michelle, did you like the song?"
You think it's going to be a hit?
Yes.
Should I let it play?
You should let it play.
"Well, there we have it, another vote."

The suit wasn't brown when I started.
"DALE: ""I'm fixing to feed these chickens."""
"I say, ""Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?"""
"Put that on daddy's plate, sweetheart."
"And he says, ""Ray Malcolm?"
Who wants to bet?
- $20 says he don't show.
- You're on.
Thank you.
"- Tie that up for me, will you?"
- Hardy!
I've been calling you for an hour.
You missed roll call.
Penderman's really pissed.
You look like shit.
Did you fall off the wagon?
You're a fucking mess.
I'm sick of taking shit for you.
- What do I put in the log?
- Will you get the stern line?
You're a real asshole.
How did I end up with you?
Hardy!
"Get some dry clothes on, Sacco."
I'll catch you on the next run.
"River Rescue 9221, this is base."
We have a 111 one mile south of Neville Island.

"- Hi, Jessie."
"- Hey, Mick."
Ben around?
No.
He went with Mom to the store.
Are you bored?
"Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid."
You can hang out here with me for a while if you want.
Are you sure?
You don't mind?
Tell you what.
I was thinking about going for a boat ride.
I could use a little muscle.
Sure!
I'm real strong.
Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you.
"'Cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser."
Ready?
Go!
I'll race ya!
"Jessie, why do you have to go away to school?"
JESSIE:
Because I'm a woman with a past.
I was a bad girl.
I got kicked out of my school here.
MIKEY:
What did you do?
Kill somebody?
-You quietly.
-You're boring.

"No, he is nobody."
I want to know what is love.
"Hey, Dude."

I want to show me ...
"-Ramon, get out."

What is it?
We are having a conversation family with Erik.
So you also zoam and I do not understand.
"-Friend, please."
-Let me handle this.
"No, no, no."
-Let me tell you something.
What is his best friend it can not meet the father and son.
"Hello, where are you."
"Hello, hello, hello."
"Look at him here, know cuddly."
The fact that wild as we can not be tamed.
-This place sucks!
"-Raul, do not be ridiculous."
"I will not be, I will return home to delelândia."
Erik?
"Knock, Knock!"
"Honey, I think he wants to be alone now."
We can not let it himself in a hole.
"-We take care of him, uncle."
-You can leave!
"He's in his crib, like you said."
"Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone."
He's not alone.
He has you.
"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.
"But... and if I'm gonna be a good father,"
I've gotta do what's best for him.
I can't fix you.
I can't... make you walk out the front door.
You have to do it yourself.
And I have to let you.

I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
"Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!"
"Wh-why, thank you!"
"Now, thank you all for your kind welcome!"
"-Say, what's that button do?"
-I'll show you.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
"Hey, Woody's got something like that."
His is a pull string.
-Only it's...
-Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

This is a quality sound system.
"Probably all copper wiring, huh?"
"So, where you from?"

Hong Kong?
"Well, no."

"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
You must return to him.
"-Father, I..."
I don't want to be parted from you.
"-No need to, my dear."
"Here, wear this."
It will keep us in mind of one another.
Remember to tell no one that you've seen me yet.
-Monitor?
-My dear Doctor.
-I can't thank you enough.
-There is no need.
"You, too, Tegan."
"You, too."
-Where are the others?
-Adric and Nyssa went to look for the Master.
What?
They should know better than that.
There's been enough unnecessary deaths as it is.
-What deaths?
-The murder of innocent Logopolitans.
And the murder of innocent Earth people.
-Earth people?
-Yes.
-Aunty Vanessa?
-Yes.
"I'm so sorry, Tegan."
I'm so sorry.
The Master is already at work on Logopolis.
I'm going to stop him if it's the last thing I do.
Nyssa!
-Did you find him?
-No.
- What?
- Fawlty!
"What are you talking about, you silly little man?"
What is going on here?
"I ask him for my room, and he tells me the manager's a Mr. Watt, aged 40."
No.
"No, no."
Faw-lty.
"""Faulty""?"
What's wrong with him?
"It's all right, Mrs. Richards."
He's from Barcelona.
The manager's from Barcelona?
"No, no, no."
He's from Swanage.
- And you're in 22.
- What?
You're in room 22.
"Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?"
"Very nice stay, Mr. Fawlty."
"Ah, glad you enjoyed it."
"Polly, would you get Mr. Firkin's bill, please?"
When will we see you again?
"Oh, not for a few weeks."
"You're not by any chance a betting man, Mr. Fawlty?"
"Er... well, I used to be."
Only there's a very nice little filly running at Exeter this afternoon.
- Really?
- Dragonfly.
Ah.
- Dragonfly?
- Yeah.
Got one.
I also have infinity!

Look at these guys.
They're killers.
You're the boss.
You should keep your word.
Don't talk crap.
"I won't pay him, even ifyou beg."
"Mr. Weng, let me keep my word and pay him what I promised."
Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.
Go to hell!
Ifyou hadn't worked for my father for so long...
I'd have kicked the shit out ofyou!
Who is he?

We've momentarily lost contact with Chopper Five.
"This is Warner Saunders, with Rescue in Action."
Squeeze the bag when I count to five.
"- One, two, three, four, five."
- Like this?
Yeah.
"One, two, three, four, five."
"One, two...."
We're gonna lose this.

"Mark, where are you?"
Where the hell's County?
- You told me to turn it off.

Keep bagging him.
Squeeze it like that.

What?
"Just do it, you little turd."
- I killed Jonesy.
"- And what, hey?"
"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.

It was my mother's.
"When I got my first job, I bought it from her."
"I was 21, 22."
Your notes say you had a Lancia Fulvia.
Yeah.
A fantastic car!
It WAS fantastic.
Fulvias are a pretty car.
What was it like?
Red and chrome.
Yeah?
"Coupe, two seater, black leather seats."
"Quite a difficult gear shift, actually."
It took a bit of driving.
Wooden steering wheel. 1973.
Beautiful things.
And now?
"I've got a Jaguar, actually!"

When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"

They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"I can't stay here, Henry."
I'm sorry.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(GROANING)
"Oh, shit."
(SNORTING) Ah!
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
"Alright, alright!"
- Griffin...
"Oh, my God!"
"- Hey, Sandy."
What happened?
I'll call 911.
"- No, no, no... don't."
"- OK, I'll get some ice."
"No I don't have time for that, just sit down."
- What?
Griff...
- Sandy just sit down.
Sit down.
I need money.
"I got into some trouble with some guys tonight, and, uh, they say that if I don't pay them tonight, I..."
- We have to call the police.
"- No, don't."
"Sandy, the police won't, just..."
It's better if...
I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.
- No...
"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"
"Sandy, I'm scared, I am scared,"
- and I am begging you for money...
- How much?
- A grand.
- $1000?
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.
[PLATES SHATTERING]
"Okay, gotta go."
"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates."
Maybe I'll see you there.
You're busy.
I shouldn't have called.
You called me.
"- Yup, good."
- Bye.
KEITH [ON TV]:
How...?
How do you work on it?
"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
I mean  pretend I'm her.
Amanda.
He's into me.
Awesome.
I knew it.
- Who's this now?
- Alex.
It's totally clear to me now.
He's Watts.
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
Ah...
Yeah.
- Wow.
- Huh?
You're amazing!
What are you doin'?
"Doc, wait!"
Giddup right in there!
"Come on, Rusty."
"Doc, hold it!"
"Seriously, your driving's incredible!"
- Wonderful.
"Now, go away."
"- Hey, I mean it."
You've still got it!
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.
"I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same."
We are not the same!
Understand?
"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
You people haven't heard the last of this.
-Good night.
-Night.
KELLY:
You okay?
There's an adversarial relationship between DA's and detectives.
I accept that.
But when I asked you to do the supplementals...
-... youmadeit personal.
-l did. I was out of line.
-lt got like old times. I won't let--
-You shouldn't.
I thought it's okay we work together.
"I thought-- lt's working out great, okay?"
Just seeing you around here...
"... takinganinterestinpeople,doing  your job. lt's great seeing you."
Seeing you smile.
Are you flirting with me?
"No, I was... ."
Can I get back to you on that?
"-Good night, guys."
KELLY:
"Night, lieutenant."
SlPOWlCZ:
"Hey, Laura."
LAURA:
Hey.
"Hey, John, listen, I got that gas problem fixed in my apartment."
-l'm having a visitor over.
-Have a great time.
"Oh, yeah."
lnteresting-looking dog you got there.
No.
(Clinking) Think!
Bob's been picking her up all week.
She's been humming stupid songs all around the house.
(Grunts) Last night she came home with green glitter in her hair.
Oh.
Stop it!
"That's right, Sue."
Mom's still in the play.
(Gasps)
What?
!
"You know, when you said lunch and bowling,"
I didn't realize you could do it all in one awesome place.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
"Hey, you're a pretty good bowler, too, you know?"
What did you end up with?
39.
39.
That's pretty good for a 7-year-old.
"No, I'm 10."
Oh.
"Well, you should be better then."
(Brakes squeal)
Okay.
Time for you to take the wheel.
(Shifts gears) What?
"Well, you gotta learn to drive some time, don't ya?"
"Um, don't I have to be 16?"
(Chuckles) Who says?
The state does.
I don't have a license.
Thank you.
-It sounds amazing.
-Thanks.
-I'll get the rest this week.
"-Yeah, no problem."
Good night.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's lan in the penthouse.
We need another bottle of Chateau Marmont.
Sorry.
Dom Perignon.
Cheers.
Thanks.
I think it's more comfortable inside.
I think it's one of the best records I've done.
I think it's the best record you've done too.
"I didn't say ""the best."""
"-She said the best, didn't she?"
"-I thought she said ""the last."""
You see?
You saved the best for last.
I know it's not the last.
"No, don't go."
Don't go.
-You should get some sleep.
"-No, we never sleep."
Why have you got your clothes on?
-What are you talking about?
-You look so much better with them off.
Come here.
We've been entertaining you for a while so why don't you entertain us?
"Oh, she's about the same, thanks."
She appreciated your sending over that custard.
"Oh, excuse me, please."
Excuse me.
-That one seems superior to the others.
-Does he?
-I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
-His mother's sick.
-Is he married?
-No.
-Is he a wolf?
"-Why, BIanche."
"-well, no, I don't think he would be."
-What does he do?
He's on the Precision Bench in the Spare Parts Department.
The plant that stanley travels for.
-Is that something much?
-No.
stanley's the only one in his crowd likely to get any work.
"Hey, BIanche, you're standing in the light."
Am I?
Gracious.
You ought to see their wives.
"Oh, I can imagine."
"Big, beefy things, I suppose."
-Do you know that one upstairs?
"-Oh, yes."
"well, one night...."
And the pIaster--!
"Hey, you hens!"
-Cut out that cackling in there.
-You can't hear us.
"Now, if you come back to this town,"
I'll know it.
And I'll get you.
Understand?
"(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, sir."
"Oh, I won't come back to this town, honest."
"As a matter of fact, I'm going home today."
Tout de suite.
"Here, let me..."
Let me show you.
"You see, here's my... my fare, $26.40, to Blitzen, Washington."
"Oh, man."
"Oh, be careful, bleeding."
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm going to get the very first train home.
"I swear, honest, so..."
"So, goodbye."
Au revoir.
Remember me to the little woman.
(TITTERING)
"(STUTTERING) Goodbye, man."
Nice...
Nice going.
Let's have the diamond.
Here you are.
"It's only bubblegum, stupid."
But it was in his pocket.
I thought...
"Oh, he's still got it on him."
"Well, you can get it back."
You know where he's going.
MAN 1 ON PA:
It's bedtime now.
Good night.
( door closes )
( rustling )
( inaudible whispering )
- She's so different.
- Well...
It's just the operation.
You think?
Yeah.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you'd had an operation like that?
I don't know.
She s not like our mom.
Play it again.
[woman] I'm giving you lots and lots of kisses.
( kissing)
I can't wait until I'm back.

Whoa.
Yikes.
Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."
- We came a really long way to visit.
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, that is so sweet and thoughtful."
It is.
Isn't it?
I'm fine.
"Grey, what are you doing?"
"If you sleep with me, you lunch with me."
New rule.
"You let interns sit with you at lunch, dr."
Sloan?
That is so cool.
"Oh, you want to go halfsies with me on that cookie?"
"Uh, what are you gonna trade me for it, huh?"
"You guys, they have Tater Tots!"
I have to go.
Mark.
Mrs. Shepherd.
- You've been avoiding me.
- What?
No.
You have that same guilty look on your face as you did when you were 10 years old.
And you put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave.
"I never pressed ""Start""."
What's going on?
I'm sleeping with her.
"Oh, Mark!"
Not again.
- How could you?
"- No, no."
"No, not Meredith."
"God, no."
Meredith's little sister.
Which one is she?
"The, uh, the... one with the juice box."
Are my new organs here yet?
"Mm, not yet."
- No.
"You're doing the right thing, man."
- Send a postcard?
- Sure.
Call me.
Fly's down.
Honey.
Michael's coming over.
- You told him I was here?
- He knew.
"Come on, Mom."
"Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know."
"I know it hurts like hell and I am sorry, I really am."
"But you know, two days ago you told me these things happen..."
"You and Daddy have been together 30 years, Mom."
We aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know.
I know.
"And I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?"
I'm not.
There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable.
He did an awful thing.
"It's not an awful thing, Mom."
It's an unforgivable thing.
Unforgivable?
What do you want?
- I just want to talk to you!
- Get out of here!
It's over!
- Jenna?
- You hear me?
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.
- Thank you.
"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?
"Okay, I'll talk to you later."
- Nothing.
- Me neither.
Tapia Park's just over the hill.
Let's check that out.
There it is.
- What's wrong?
"- Well, that baby food is poisoned."
L.A. 15-7 Mary 4.

Can't you see it's all wrong?
You're my girlfriend!
And you're my best friend.
"- Tony, I love her."
"- No, you don't."
"OK, maybe I don't."
He loves Cassie.
And you love me.
That works.
- We work.
- Why now?
It's too late.
"It's always been there, Michelle."
It just took a while.
I need you.
You can't have her.
It's wrong.
It's wrong.
That's all I'm trying to say.

My art coursework.
It's on the subject of emotion and you seem quite emotional.
So you can do it for me.

"Don't cry, Siu."

But we didn't even see them.
Are the seven Dragon Balls really even there?
"Mai, trust me."
They're on that ship.

Huh?

Let's get out of here.
"How'd you like that, you dumb shark?"

I thought I was going to die...
You two have done well.
Hey.
What're you doing?
Hey.
Climb this.
"You have my thanks, children."
What were you doing down there?
We're here for the Dra drama serial we're shooting.
Where're your cameras?

"Wait, hold it, Victor, hold it."
"Listen, can we just come in and take a quick look around."
Now you know the rules.
Nobody in there until 'til the ma gets here.
Not anymore.
You know why;
"Maybe you better not talk about it now, Doc."
Got to-- l'll tell you why.
Lutie.
I can say it now.
Lutie.
"Wouldn't let anybody speak her name, would you, Jim;"
But you gotta humor me.
"Last wish, you know."
All Lutie needed was a little help from you.
She had better coming than she got.
She never forgot her children.
She was all right.
And you sent her away twice.
Your fault.
"That's right, yours."
"People don't tell you that much, do they, Jim;"
Jim.
Jim.
You hear me;
"Yes, Doc. I hear you."
"You, you'll never change."
You still got that same look in your eyes.
"No, you'll never change."
The Doc.
"Out of his head, I guess, Jim."
"No, he was right."
Just right.
"He's gone, gentlemen."
"Colonel Brewton, I had no idea."

Hi.
Hi.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
You all right?
"I'm fine, Jason."
I'm watching the show.
"We do have to get back before sunrise, though."
Let's get a move on.
"I don't think that's a good idea, Jason."
"Come on, hon."
Let's go.
We're very close.
"Jason, I'm not going anywhere."
"It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go."
I love you.
But we cannot do this to each other anymore.
It's over.
It's over.
"Daddy, wait."
I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.
I'll go back to the other side.
No.
Then you...
"You,d be doing what I did."
Trying to be something that you're not.
You're 20.
Go be 20.
All right?
I will not lose you.
All right?
I cannot lose you.
You got me out here with Matthew Stafford's little brother.
That's all I can get on such short notice.

I'm taking a motherfucking Uber home.
I hate you right now.
You embarrassed me out there.

So you were friends with Dirk?

"Uh, yes, sir, in high school."

I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
Sit down.
"When did, uh-"
- When did Dirk pass?
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, uh-- First, drinking, then drugs."
And then too many drugs and--
He just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know."
"Dirk, he, uh-"
- He had his troubles.
What kind of troubles?
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money and, well, you know, kids, they can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
Mm-hm.
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the Jerk.
"-After what happened to his mother, he--"
-His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
-I'm sorry.
What should I do now?
Get work with the renovators.
Dad told me to ask for Jakki.
I'm Jakki.
"Jesse, Taisto's son."
Do you have any work for me?
What can you do?
-I'm not afraid of heights.
I used to be a firefighter.
Get overalls.
Really?
Yes.
This goes into your phone bill.
-Good.
My wife is sleeping right here.
- They usually do.
I'm not a marriage counselor.
"- I have an idea, you see..."
I've been thinking that...
Hello?
Are you role-playing again?
-I guess.
"You need a life, Jemina."
You're always doing homework or just dreaming.
I haven't done any homework in years.
Have sex with a nice boy.
There are condoms in my drawer.
"Moms don't talk like that, Mom."
And I'm not sleeping with anyone.
"It's pretty cool, Mom."
They court me like monkeys.

And let me do it for you baby.
I'll do it and you could hit me if I do it wrong.
Beg for it.
You asked for it.
Let me see your beautiful cock.

Come on.

"That green woman said she was dead, how can she be alive now?"
This technology has capacities and abilities beyond anything your puny human mind could possibly understand.
Try not to worry.
Isn't the creature still a danger?
It could reform.
"No, not in here."
Then you should be with Miss Clara.

"-Put it in my car, I'll take it home."
-All right.
It'd be an honor to hang this picture in my house.
"Tony, can you come down here, please?"
What's the matter?
-What happened?
-Your nephew.
Christopher did this?
He hit you?
What for?
-What's the difference?
-He was high.
"Little prick, I'm going to wring his fucking neck."
Where is he?

We're friends of Felix.
- Friends of Felix?

You want the keeper's cabin.
You'll have to follow the track through the woods about half a mile.
"Right, uh, thanks."
You'll have to walk.
The track's too rough for city cars.
"Oh, okay."
"""Welcome to the country, folks."""
- Is it just me or is this a bit spooky?
"- It's just you, pussy."
- What's that?
- Do it!
I-
- I got it written down out in the car.
"Okay, well, let's stop by the motel because I'd like to thank the kid."
"Now, that's unusual-- somebody who'd do something like that, something worth that much."
"Yeah, and we'll swing by and pick up Stu at the Bullfrog."
Yeah.

Still looking for a new shoe size?
I know all the jokes.
Cement C.
What I need now are the straight lines.
The police commissioner works for the mayor.
- What is your point?
- Trust me or fuck you.
Stand up.
I just need to see how many people that I'm talking to.
It's just me.
All right.
Eddie called me from Manhattan South.
The night before?
You'll be able to do it now.

"Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either."
"But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks."
"All right, I told you I'm buying him, and I am."
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
"- Quiet, quiet."
Whose money is this?
"Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss."
"The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us."
Come on.!
Mush.!
Mush.!
Ho!
Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on!
Get back there!
What'd you bring this baboon along for?

He'll learn to like him!
- Come on!
Let's go!
Mush!

Come on!
Get up there!
"Come on, gray boy!"
"Come on, Buck."

No baggage.
"No baggage, love that."
"No baggage, no babies."
Likey. (LAUGHING)
This is fun.
I'm having a fun time in this place.
"And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?"
WAYNE:
Katy!
It's impolite to talk about your money.
He's no slouch.
Okay.
Touche.
"Well, I'm about to begin your story."
"Where maybe one is ""too hard."""
"Maybe one is, um..."
- But in the end...
"- Yeah, you lost him."
He seems...
He seems nice.
Do you live...
Do you live in here?
"So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne?"
Ready to fall in Goldi-love?
Or Goldi-lust?
You won't be Goldi-laughin' when I break your Goldi-legs.
Dim the Goldi-lights?
Nights of your Goldi-life?
Use your Goldi-language.
Make her Goldi-laugh.
When did this happen?
When you were with her.
Christ.
Why didn't you beep me?
"Hey, John, you were in Milwaukee."
"Look, I've got a patroleo with her."
Who?
Crowe?
"Aw, Jesus, Tommy."
I told him to call me... if anything happens...
anything at all.
Let me ask you something.
"You believe her, don't you?"
"Yeah, sure, I believe her."
"Tommy, could you take over for Crowe through tonight... just till I get my head fucking straight here?"
"Good morning, Miss Brody."
Where's John?
He's working.
You'll be safe with me.
"Well, can you tell me when he'll be available?"
No.
No message.
Miss Brody!
It's Detective Ridgely.
Is everything all right?
Did you get my messages?
I've been calling you... and calling you.
Are you OK?
Where's Ridgely?
Ridgely?
What are you...
Do you have a death wish or something?
"Look, would you mind getting out of here?"
Not at all.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
"Oh, I'm..."
What is the matter with you?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
"I'm awfully sorry I dropped my suitcase, and I hope I didn't hurt you, mister."
"I'll put all my things back in the suitcase, and I'll get out of your way."
What is this?
(EXCLAIMING)
"Look out, conductors!"
It's the little boy!
Look out!
(SIGHING)
"Oh, geez."
He can't have gone far.
I've got to find him.
CONDUCTOR 1:
You've got to find him?
We've got to find him.
Half-fare!
CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.
"What's the matter, son?"
You're trembling.
I have very loose bones.
Are you lost?
"Come on, let's sit down."
Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.
No.
It's me... and the godfather of my son.
You're kidding.
"That's what Julia wants, too?"
Yeah.
What do you say?
Yeah!
You bet!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Renee!
Let me in.
Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
"What do you mean, ""no""?"
"Cliff, where is he?"
As...
"As soon as I heard the police coming in, I told him to get out."
I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.
- What are you on about?
- David's not like you.
He won't cope in prison.
Give him a chance to get away.
Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.
Grab your case.
Come on.
"I'm staying here, in case John comes back."
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead."
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.
It fucking knows.
It knows.
- It knows!
- It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
- Now open the door.
"- Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.
Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay."
Fuck.
Okay.
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."
Really?
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?
- There was an accident.
What did he do to her?
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
"For over a century, I have lived in secret."
Until now.
That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
I used to cry for you!
And I used to engross in yourthoughts!
Neither did I sleep nor did I remain awake!

- It's Ryan Gosling.
Come on.

"- I assure you, it's just fine and dandy."
"- He invited us, sweetheart."

I don't really wanna be wearing this.

"He said, ""Yeah, we're just rehearsing now."""
- Ohh.
"- Uh, um..."
- What are these?
- She doesn't know what they are.
Ha-ha-ha.
They're goldfish.
"I know what a goldfish is, but why do you have goldfish in your car?"
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
"- You did, but most of it's broken."
"Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine."
"Yeah, but it's broken."
"Hey, look at that."
I think it's working.
"- Oh, my God!"
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
"- Hey, we got the TV back!"
All right.
You guys are awesome.
I'm gonna make you so much jam.

Wait.

I buried it under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.
But that was a year ago.
The whole garden's changed since then.
"Ain't buying' it, Roger."
The sun's almost gone down and the race is over.
"If you don't get that money before they close this place, there's gonna be something else planted here."
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!
"Nine, 10, 11, 12..."
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!
This is ridiculous!
It's okay.
He can still win.
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!
"Come on, Magnum!"
- Come on!
"I did my best to stop them, Judge Travis."
"Now, I can see that, Litefoot."
stains:
"Come on, let's go, boys."
Stand him up.
"No, bring him on this mule."
"Come on, get him up there."
"Come on, get up there."
It's your last ride.
"There, boy."
That's it.
That's right.
You get to go see the Lord.
"All right, get the rope up over there."
Get up there.
All right.
[whistles]
"Hyah, hyah, hyah!"
Maybe you'd like to apologize for killing that white man.
[GUNSHOT]
"Hyah, hyah!"
[GLASS shattering ]
"Glad to see you, boys."
I know who you seven sons of bitches are.
You're not gonna get away with this.
"-Right this way, gentlemen."
"-Yes, ma'am."
I think I brought everything you asked for.
MAUDE:
"Oh, thank you, Mary."
MARY:
I just hope it's not too terrible for you in here.
Clark?
Roland?
Zendaya?
- Who?
"- It's Brooke, isn't it?"
[gasps]:
It's Brooke!
I've got all I need.
"But I, I didn't say anything."
"Hey, Emma."
We're finally here.
Face-to-face.
[somberly]:
To face.
I invited Amy to our after-work hang.
[breathily]:
Oh...
"Hi, Amy."
AMY:
Sorry we're late.
It was a crazy day at the office.
"I had to calculate the company's overtime, then I realized that was making me go overtime, and that I had to include that, too... ugh, my life!"
I could really use a drink.
"I'll go order two beers, Amy."
Maybe they'll give me a third one
I didn't ask for.
"Jack, help!"
Emma doesn't know this is a date.
How can that be?
You were so clear when you asked her out.
"I know, but she brought her friend Amy."
"Okay, don't panic."
"He's Mr. ABCD, he's good at playing deadly games."
He's going to play Russian Roulette!
There are 3 bullets in this Russian Roulette.
Over there!
Let's start the game!
I'm done!
"Hiroshima, he's shot himself 3 times!"
"Damn it, wake him up!"
He's dead.
"You're just as dead, Wake Yoyo!"
Follow me!
Follow me!
- l heard something.
- Let me see if I hear it!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What happened?
- l asked you what happened?
- Nothing...!
But there are mechanical traps.
I'll go first!
Robin darling!
You're terrific!
You always know where they are!
Sure. I know exactly where they are.
"So you go first, I'll protect you from the back."
Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright!
I can hear something!
Him again?
"No, he's Mr. ABCD's half brother, Mr. EFGH,"
Born 3 days after his brother.
- Never mind.
Dad's at Aunt Rosa's.
She wants us to come.
- What?
- Dad is at Aunt Rosa's!
- He came especially?
Why?
- How should I know?
He isn't answering.
Where is he?
Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere.
- What did Rosa say?
- To come.
You're more hysterical than her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why didn't you invite me along?
That was very unkind of you.
You want to know who your father is.
Good for you.
Really.
"But I want to know, too."
"I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives."
I won't hold you up.
Have some tea and go.
It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear.
That's all.
"Rosa, where's the Sweet'N'Low?"
In the kitchen?
I swore to Jonah.
"I have to pinch myself, I think I'm dreaming."

- [accordion]
- Sebastian!
"Ariel, what are you..."
How could you...
What is all this?
"It's, uh..."
It's just my collection.
"Oh, I see."
"Your collection, hmm."
If your father knew about this place...
"You're not gonna tell him, are you?"
"Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand."
"Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here."
I'll take you home
- and get you something warm to drink.
- [Rumbling]
- [Ariel] What do you suppose...
- Ariel?
Ariel?
I know.
But that doesn't mean you didn't.
Justin.
I get the feeling you're not here to see me.
"No, I'm not."
Is Rebecca here?
"Rebecca, this is Justin."
Justin Walker.
So you're one of them?
- His family?
- Yeah.
"- I got it, Mom."
- OK.
"If you're expecting tears from me, you can forget it."
I'm not expecting anything.
I just wanted to meet you.
"Well, I'm here."
I'm real.
You can even touch me.
- Uh... you want to walk?
- OK.
It's so bizarre.
"We live, like, 15 minutes away."
"In L.A., that's practically like being neighbors."
- Where did you go to school?
- I started at La Salle.
Swanky.
I got kicked out junior year and I finished up at San Marino.
- What about you?
- Marshall.
I think we played you in football.
- I didn't play football.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
Master finagler!
"-Oh, right."
-(laughter)
"Drink up, boys."
"Ernie, uh, what have you been doing since you got out of the Army?"
I'm with some outfit.
"Come on, drink up."
"Oh, come on, come on, now, Ernie."
-What are you doing?
"-Well, it's a big outfit-- big."
"If I mention the name, you'd know it right away."
MORGAN:
What outfit?
What difference does it make?
I'm doing all right.
Believe me.
"Secret, huh?"
"Well, in a way, it has to be, yeah."
TUBBY:
I got it-- government work.
You could call it that.
Yeah.
You got a contract with the government.
For four years.
-Four years?
-Whoa.
I got a six months' contract.
Then comes cancellations and changes in specifications.
-How do you do it?
-Very simple.
"When the four years is up, I simply reen... uh, renegotiate."
-They're only too glad to do business with me. -(buzzing)
The tea is for Sifu!
Thinking of making a run for it?
Grab him!
Sifu!
- He's Wong Fei-hung?
"- Yes, it's him!"
That guy's involved as well!
He knows Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
Stop!
On your knees!
- Sifu...
- Sifu...
You two have gone too far!
Committing crimes in my name!
You're the real Wong Fei-hung?
I've been too lenient with them.
"Marshal, please don't take offence."
I'll deal with them later!
"OK, Wong Fei-hung."
"I won't pursue this, for your sake."
"Marshal, thanks for your understanding."
"Tonight, I'll hold a dinner upstairs especially for you."
Good on you.
"Foon, come with me!"
Sifu Wong?
You've already learnt Shirt Pinching Toad Trap.
You don't need another Sifu.
Get out!
Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
"Have another drink, have another drink."
Thank you for coming.
"Sifu Wong, I'll drink to your hospitality."
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
And a six.
Pair of threes still best.
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
"Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me?"
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal...
-...the poor box?
-Ha.
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.
I believe you.
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.
"Oh, Christ!"
I should have been there.
I wasn't there.
Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
Good night.
Hold it.
Hold it.
"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
"Higher, all the way."
That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?
man-- that guy has been calling me every night wanting to know when it's gonna happen.
he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.
smartass.
Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
"Don't worry, boss, I will."
[Rustling]
[Toilet flushing]
[Gasping]
Charlie!
Tommy!
"Hey, you!"
"I know you're out there, somewhere!"
What are you doin'?
"What the hell are you doin', huh?"
"What the... oh, Jesus Christ, no, no."
"Hey, look..."
"Hey, listen, pal."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you...
look.
"What are you doing, huh?"
"Listen, who hired you..."
Who hired you?
What are you doin'?
"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
"You're not gonna get away with it, you hear me?"
"Holy shit... what are you, crazy, or something?"
"Hey-hey, you don't wanna fucking talk to me?"
What are you doin'?
"Hey, leave that alone, huh?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, hold it... take it easy."
"Don't do it, don't do it."
"Hold it... no, no, no."
Holy shit.
"Holy... hey, wait a minute."
-Thank you so much.
"MacNeil/Lehrer, Friday night."
Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing."
It's front-loaded.
-With who?
-With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
-Judge Walter Stern?
-Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"-Oh, good."
Where?
-Woerner's.
Woerner's?
-The hangout at Borough Hall?
-That's it.
"When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest."
Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it...
... justunaffordablerightnow .
Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
Back to the hotel?
What hotel?
The Intersexion.
I'II go check it out.
well... next!
You go.
"Name, address and occupation."
Duck...
"lionel PIourde,"
"I Iive at 157, 3rd lane in St-Jude."
Occupation...
"I worked on the Van KIee farm, but I had a small accident, so..."
I'm declared an invalid...
that's about it.
"OK, go ahead."
What happened?
What happened?
"well, a Iot happened."
From the top.
"well, at the beginning..."
"Josée Morin, Touchy Tougas and me, we... we met at the hotel around 7:00pm."
"Start with when you arrived, and you saw the black guy."
You saw him with the lady and her gun.
That's it.
That's what?
That's it... we saw them.
You got out of your car?
Yeah.
"Who was there with you, aside from the lady, her son and the suspect?"
There was the one you call Touchy?
Sorry.
"Josée Morin, the dancer..."
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?
One condition.
Just this.
Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Haha haha!
"Check this, yo."
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
Kosovan Kate.
Who's Kosovan Kate.
She works with the Albanians.
Here.
You need to wear these.
Give the old bill an head start.
"So she's setting up her own people, is she?"
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?
- (Coughs)
Are you OK?
I woke up and you were gone.
I read your note.
I crossed the bridge and just as I got to the other side the quake hit.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yes.
Let's get you out...
Let's get you out of here.
(Coughs)
"Tilo Mistress, you have shown your devotion to the spices."
The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.
I mean here.
I'm not leaving here.
"Tilo, there's nothing left here."
This is my home.
I guess I can help you rebuild it.
You never told me what my spice is.
Sesame.
Tilo.
(Inhales)
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him?
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
Good night.
"Don't get too attached, Dale."
"Come on, Jill."
We're gonna go have a sleepover at Dale's tonight.
Drew!
You ok?
She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
"Come on, babe."
"Ah, that's disgusting."
No.
This is definitely picture worthy.
Is that her puke bucket?
Look at...
Becca's panties.
They're grannie panties.
Bowie.
He's gonna have the worst diarrhea in the morning.
"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.

That's the idea.
"Thank you, sir."

Here comes the colonel.
"He's in that cabin, colonel."
"You can't go down there, colonel."
The boy's gone crazy.

No one's taking me and that goes for you too.
"Stay there or I'll drop you, I meant it."
Your last chance to turn around.
I'll count three.

Hurry it up.
"Hello, Dad."
Why am I calling you dad;
"-You used to call me that, Brock."
-Not since I got old enough to know better.
Growing up.
"That's great, isn't it;"
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
"You don't scare worth a nickel, Dad."
"-Docs always try, don't they;"
Oh.
Kissing ass is part of the job.
We're hot right now.
It's expected of us.
"I was expected to be at my own wedding, but guess what."
- Where was I?
In your kitchen.
- When was this now?
Don't make this about me.
You need to be in the kitchen.
"I'd be happy to work the room for you,Jack."
People don't like you as much as you think.
Move.
"Look, this came down from the Prince of Darkness."
It's happening.
But don't worry.
I put somebody in charge.
"In which case, I humbly and gratefully accept."
- Hey.
"- Guys, this is Becky."
We went to culinary school together.
She'll be covering for me.
Uh
- I
- But you're a- She's a-
Yes.
I pee sitting down.
Get over it.
- Wait.
Becky Sharp from Becky's on Fourth?
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that place.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah.
"You help her, Carlo."
-What is that?
Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those Japs?
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"-You're right, that's Pop talking!"
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college andjoin the army!
I did.
"Come on, up on the stools, everybody."
I've an announcement to make.
Quick.
"Come on, move it, move it, will yous?"
Come on!
"Quick, get up there!"
Would you take it easy?
Get her down off that.
People have to eat at the...
Get her off the stool!
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Yeah, good lad."
"There you go, what."
- What is it?
- Open it and see.
It's not a bike.
"He's brilliant, isn't he?"
I know that!
"- Ooh, wow."
- Very nice.
It's a pump.
"It's a very good one, too."
"See, I'm gonna get you a wheel for your Christmas... and another wheel for your next birthday... and then the saddle, what."
Ha ha ha ha.
You can pump yourself to school every morning now.
"Go away, you."
Yous are messing.
"We are, of course."
"Kay, when you're ready."
Do... no.
"My... my father never looked like that, so he can't be."
He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."
- But he is.
- Mnh-mnh.
He's the best version of your father.
"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."
"Inside, however, I'm still just me."
You saw it.
"I think Gracie saw it, too."
Don't you say her name.
Arthur:
Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.
What the hell is that thing?
"Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start."
You're not taking me through anything.
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
"You two, this... this apartment, this... that tank out there."
That... that thing in the mirror.

Son.
It's me.
I'm back.
No.
I buried you.

What didn't come from the big and tall shop?
Ok.
I will show you.
The thing is they use very good fabric.

"Yes, there is."
This.

Great.

That must be a real comfort to you at a time like this.
- Jimmy.
- Shut up!
Shut your fucking mouth!
I loved you.
You're my brother and you betrayed me for him.
You knew I was the best cop!
Say it!
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
"Tommy, let's have a drink."
Me and you.
Just like the old days.
Remember?
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
"You're a drunk, aren't you?"
Drink it!
Are you too proud to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink with your little dove.
Hey.

"Jeez, not again."
Eva?
I'll have a look.
"Come on, shug?"
Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
My boyfriend surprised me.
Going to countdown to the New Year there.
Counting down at Central World would be the same?
Just as boring.
You want to say that to my boyfriend?
You're leaving now?
"Yeah, boarding soon."
So you want anything?
I don't know.
No.
Just go.
Have fun.
Alright.
Happy New Year in advance.

What do you want it for?
I'm buying it as a New Year's gift.

We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.

Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.

Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.

I didn't before.

Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."

Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."

They don't know these three are assholes.

Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"
[Music playing]
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.

"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
"- Yes, Mr. Thurston..."
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
"- No, no."
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
"Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights."
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
"Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston."
"Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards."
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
"Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards."
But you were serving me!
Make this quick.
"We're all gonna pull you through this, all right?"
Positive attitude - that's everything.
"Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg."
I think he'll be fine.
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!

Great.
"Now I got another 20,000 forms to fill out."
[ Grunting ] Why do they make these things out of metal?
"Uh, I think it's twisted."
"No, it's coming."
It's coming!
"- Oh, I don't know, Russ."
- It's coming!
Shit!
Fuck!

Why the fuck is it snowing now?
Fuck!

Follow us in the car.
Get support.

Hold on tight.
"Screen's up, sir."
"God, don't let Clayton be driving."
"Harry, stay back!"
Get down.
Slow down!
Jesus!
Give him room!
Harry!
I see it.
Give me machete.
- What's the simple solution to the Fenchurch and Lau murders?
- Kevin Grey killed them both.
"Kevin, don't."
Hey!
Hey!
"Oh, Lily-Anne!"

- You certainly had the motive.
Follow the lady!

His head's not screwed on right.
"When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff."
"Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox."
Okay.

Ow!
Oh!

Ah!
Oh!

Help me explain this.
Bull fight.

-What?
She must've crawled under there for warmth.
Are you fucking crazy?
You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.
I must have sat on her.
-Jesus.
-My poor baby.
-I'm sorry.
"It was an accident, for Christ's sake."
How long have I said she shouldn't be on the furniture?
"It's because you were fucking high, Christopher."
You and your fucking smack!
Fuck!

-I'II get you another dog.
-I don't want another dog!
-Four in the side.
-One up the ass.
So nobody's heard from ralph?
I'm starting to worry.
-I'II call him again.
-Try the gay man's choir.
I read they were having tryouts today.
"Three ball, far corner."
Son of a bitch.
Where you been?
"This was in the mail for you outside, Tony."
UPS.
-What's going on?
-He's calling ralph.
Leave a message and leave your phone number.
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
Okay.
"Over here, right over here."
And do you know who I am?
Who are you?
Must have cleared 30 patients and no one's brawling yet.
See?
"It's not that hard, is it?"
Like the man said:
"""Can't we just all get along?"""
"Sam, weren't we sending the cracked Broviac up to lR?"
-Don't you want a CBC first?
"-Yes, you're right."
"-Sam, the labs done on Mrs. Garvey?"
"-Just checked, be another half hour."
"Dr. Weaver, the search committee meeting has been moved up to 12:30."
"All right, Jerry."
Thank you.
-Dr.
Kovac.
-Dr.

There's something not right about Glenda.
"Hey, that sounds like a movie, like, Something Not Right About Glenda."
"-A body snatchers thing, shaky camera."
Morris.
I wanna re-scan her.
Really?
Why?
Because she's altered.
"-But she's a drunk, how can you tell?"
-Dr.
"Clemente, why don't you--?"
"Lindsay, no kid talk."
We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.
- Let's talk about the book.
"- Well, I loved it."
You know what else I love?
Hummus.
Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.
Belinda.
"Christine, where's Belinda?"
"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.
I am gonna have to let that girl go.
"Oh, but I'm sure she's coming right back."
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- We need hummus.
- And sangria.
"- Ooh, that sounds good."
"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."
- Where's Belinda?
"- Oh, she's not feeling well."
She's lying down.
Probably.
By now.
"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
"- Okay, 42."
Got it.
Two days ago.
That'd be the night Johnny was to call me.
Maybe he--?
"I was getting desperate, but it might be a lead."
There was one place in town where l could find out for sure.
Evening.
- Could I take a look in your icebox?
- Somebody special?
Missing Persons thought I ought to look.
- Who's missing?
- What's it to you?
- Homicide Squad.
- Lieutenant Kincaid.
- l thought you was a morgue buff.
- Buff?
A nut like those guys that chase fires.
I didn't know Homicide men hung out in the morgue.
- Where you f rom?
- Out of town.
- Frisco.
- How did you know?
The accent. I can spot any accent.
What's the name?
Charlie Wilson.
Met him on the train.
I thought I talked him out of suicide.
He didn't show f or dinner.
No word since.
- Yeah?
I meant your name.
DR. WEN!
I'VE GOT YOUR BR--
He was not.
I had no idea that there was that many Asian surgeons in this hospital..
"I got your back, T-Dog."
Then let it begin.
Quit fooling around with those guys and get down here!
Here comes the big dog!
"Dude, thanks for having my back."
Yeah.
Betrayal five.
"Hey, buddy."
Hey!
Betrayal five.
DR. WEN!
"Oh, my briefcase!"

"Oh, really, Turk?"
Because the Sacred Heart sign
I vandalized last night begs to differ! Hey!
Remember when we were in college and we made lists of all the stuff we wanted to do by the time we turned thirty?
Yeah!
Check it!
"""Things to do by thirty:"
Get married.
Buy a house.
"Learn difference between senator and congressman."""
"Uh, with a ""v"" and a lot of dollar marks."
And this one from mayor hoffman and the board of aldermen.
Jim!
I just saw old drew in the lobby.
How do you know it was him?
"Well, he looks like a runt pickle and he's got an old umbrella stick with a goose-head handle."
That's him!
I knew it!
Bellboy?
"Yes, sir."
Go and tell mr.
Fisk that mr.
Daniel drew is waiting to see him.
"Yes, sir."
Tell me-do you go to sunday school?
"Yes, sir."
"Mulberry street church, sir."
Mulberry street.
Well... i pass the plate there myself.
Here-here's two cents for you.
And remember-i'll be looking for them next sunday.
"Yes, sir."
Well?
"There's a gentleman to see you, mr."
Fisk.
"Who is it, son?"
It's mr.
"Daniel drew, sir."
Oh.
Here.
Tell him i'm busy.
"Yes, sir."
What are you doing?
"Between you and me, I can't wait to find out."
"Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can..."
Clara!
Doctor!
That was stupid!
"You were stupid, too!"
"I'm allowed, I'm good at stupid!"
That's the way to do it!
Why does she keep saying that?
"Mirroring, random mirroring."
We need to get on the roof.
This way!
"I do the hand grabbing, that's my job, that's always me!"
"Come on, quickly!"
Agh!
What are you doing?
My bustle is stuck.
Your bustle?
!
You're going to have to take those clothes off!
I didn't mean...
I know.
"I understand, I do."
Good.
What's the plan?
Who said I've got a plan?
Course you've got a plan.
You took that.
Maybe I'm an idiot.
"You're not, you're clever."
Really clever.
Oh.
* Got the devil to pay
* Living in a great big way
* Got a snap in my fingers
* Got a rhythm in my walk
*As the elephant say *
* I'm livin' in a great big way *
* Got a handful of nothin'
"Yeah, but you watch it like a hawk, honey."

[feet tapping]
[tapping continues]
[piano music] [tapping continues]
[music continues]
"Did you hear, what the lady said?"
"Not exactly, what did she say?"
She said
* I got a snap in my fingers.
And.
* And a rhythm in my walk.
You don't tell me.
* As the elephant say
* I'm livin' in a great big way *
"Oh, get away from here."
That's too much.
* I got a handful of nothin'
What?
* But I peep at it like a hawk.
Peep at nothin'?
* I'm doing okay livin' in a great big way *
Tell me more.
Tell me more.
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"- Excuse me, sir?"
- Every time I come across...
- Sir?
- It was off...
Gotta call you back.
"Hey, bro."
Where did you get the uniform?
Traded for it.
Not really my style.
But the guy threw in a phone too.
"- Pretty sweet deal, huh?"
- We're gonna need that phone.
"So, what are you gonna trade for it?"
How about a pair of handcuffs?
"Yes, thank you very much."
Okay.
So Dana Thorpe and her fiancé Craig Ellers landed at Honolulu International this morning.
Checked into a hotel ten minutes ago.
- Chin.
"- Hey, H.P.D. found the car."
Dawkins abandoned it about 15 minutes ago.
"- Parking lot, Kaka'ako Beach Park."
- Got it.
That's three blocks away from where Craig and Dana are staying.
- Whoa.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Oh, my God."
I couldn't stand it.
"Oh, my God."
Me neither.
Hey.
Hey.
You go to bed last night?
What?
"Uh, no."
[ Clears throat ]
"No, ""Rudy"" was on."
"""Unforgiven,"" and then I was too jacked to sleep, so...research."
Sam:
Gadreel?
And Metatron and the mark of Cain and...
Crickets.
"I did find us a case, though."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, was a strange death in Stillwater, Minnesota."
A competitive eater died after a hot dog-eating contest.
"So, what?"
Death by tube steak?
If only.
Dean:
"He got attacked in his car, but, uh, get this -- he shrunk from 300 pounds to 90 pounds."
Witchcraft?
Or a heavy-duty laxative.
You game?
Yeah.
Good.
Looks like it's a whore's bath for me.
I'll be ready in five.
"You sure you're okay, Dean?"
Why wouldn't I be?
'Cause -- I don't know you...
"This isn't about what I said the other day, is it?"
Here.
It's a sore.
How long has she been treating you?
Half a year.
Wow that's a long time.
Doctor Imm's patients never get better.
Stop bitching you chink.
"Chinky, stop chatting in Line."
Focus on me a little?
Here for you.
Doctor Imm.
"Tell him if he has to stay awake, do not stay awake for more than 1 day."
Take the bedtime pills.
And get some rest.
I feel the chemistry inside my body is changing.
But I don't know what it is.
Oh!
"Tell him, do not scratch."
Doc....
I....
"Hey, you're just supposed to read it."
Can I please just reply her?
Doc.
I am sorry about last month.
Read.
Can I just read her reply?
Happy New Year.
Get some rest.
Turn off your computer and go to the beach.
See the sunrise or something.
Same to you...
That's enough.
"You are the most beautiful boy, you are the most beautiful fucker."
We want to see you fuck her.
Fuck her!
"Get him, Margaret you whore."
Do it!
Give it to me baby.
Do it!
I can't.
Come on!
You can do it!
You whore.
Do it!
Come on Margaret.
Do it!
Let's go!
What for?
Let's go!
You made me do it.
This pussy has teeth no one should fuck me ever.
"What did you do with him, Margaret?"
I can't...
So where's the body?
I don't know.
Would somebody look on the roof.
Nothing out here.
What's in the box?
Was it a magic trick?
"No, Ann, it's no magic trick, I keep dead bodies in so I can fuck 'em."
"Adrian, you should leave me alone."
You should leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
I can.
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!
"Take a look, Aunt Rosa."
"On the bench, next to Mom's purse..."
- Yes?
- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.
- You know what?
You are so cute when you pout.
I didn't want to dirty anything.
There was a draft.
Mom.
- He wants tea.
- Got a bellyache?
"I don't know, it puzzled me a bit, threw me off."
I'II take care of him.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Mr. Director.
Madame.
"- Madame, how is Madame?"
- Who's a Madame?
"Madame, how is Madame?"
- Who's he talking to?
- To you.
"My mom's used to ma'am, we don't use Madame here."
Sorry.
- What did I do?
- That's my place.
This has been my mug since I was a kid.
"So much, there's no need,"
"I always have tea, and maybe one slice of toast."
"You have to eat, or she'II be offended."
Eat up.
"Have some sausages, the zabaglione's forme."
She makes it forme every morning with fresh eggs.
- It's dynamite!
- I can imagine.
Eat something.
- Just to...
- Don't you Iike it?
I wrote the cite but...
Fritz called Caltrans and he stayed to clean things up.
So maybe he remembers.
"All right, I'll call Fritz."
You two guys get back to Central.
"But you sent us home, remember?"
"Yeah, but I want you where I can reach you."
Henry getting hungry?
"Oh, yes."
"How's it going, Henry?"
"Oh, that's a boy, it's okay, Henry."
Hang on.
We're almost at the campgrounds.
You all set...?
Hi.
- Hi.
- It's kind of hot.
I thought you might like some.
Thank you.
You live here?
Yeah.
"No, not really."
But my partner does.
I kind of hang around here a lot.
It's nice to know your neighbors.
Especially when they're police officers.
"Yeah, I think so."
Well I gotta run.
You can return the glass anytime.
Sure.
Thank you.
"Hey, old buddy, did you set me up, huh?"
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich formany years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do forliving?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips forliving?
I'm gonna drag that murdering sack of dirt back to Texas...
... andhe'sgonna tell the jury the truth.
"I don't know, Vin."
The truth and Eli Joe don't seem a likely mix.
I've lived with Kiowas and Comanches.
I know a thing or two about getting the truth out of people.
I look forward to seeing that.
Too bad we gotta keep him alive.
"Since we do, we'd best get us some help."
Come on.
J.D. :
"Hey, Buck."
Josiah.
We gotta ride.
Split them up.
Everybody takes a man.

Don't shoot.

"You're finished, Eli."
Yates?
Where is he?
Where is he?
I got no problem killing you.
Won't change the fact he's gone.
Took off early.
Stop before I blush.
Actually I need your help.
I want to break up with my Thai boyfriend.
Ok and then?
He can't speak English and I can't speak Thai.
You guys can't even talk to each other and how did you get together?
You know S-E-X?
It's all about SEX.
Because sex is my life.
Okay enough.
I got it.
Thank you Tutor Pleng.
For what?
For agreeing to help me breaking up with him.
Oh no!
I didn't say I would.
But...
I got you this Louis Vuitton bag for you.
Oh yeah
Breaking up with the guy is so easy.
Don't worry.
Thank you
I grabbed it already.
You have good taste.
One original mocha ice blended please.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You have a problem?
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?
Gym?
Kaya's boyfriend?
Surgical floor?
That's good.
"All right, let's clear some of these patients. I will be on today..."
"... butfirst,runyourcases by either Drs. Kovac or Clemente."
You're on today?
"Good, I mean, that's good."
You just--
You're always stuck in administration.
Good to keep your skills honed.
Dr. Kovac and Dr. Clemente will share the honor of running the board today.
-Share?
"-Abby, head lac's ready for you."
Doctors.
-After you.
"-No, no, after you, my man."
"No, no."
Really.
"Really, I insist."
"Oh, well, I insist too."
I'm serious-- l'm serious too.
Dr. Clemente.
Board.
Right.
"Okay, Glenda, come on, come on, come on, stop it."
Don't make nobody--
"Haleh, your paranoid gardener needs another slug of Haldol."
"-Oh, it's all right. I got this."
Go ahead.
I'll be back.
"Okay, Glenda."
"Here we go, a little stick, okay?"
-Aah!

"Thank you, Baker."
You'll hear from your teacher.
Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.
"Give me a sec, Tom."
Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
-No!
"-Mom, if I eat all my pizza, can I have some alien slime?"
This cannot be happening to me.
-A stranger.
-From the outside.
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
"Before your space journey, re-energise yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three."
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 1 2.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
-This is ludicrous.
"-Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?"
Take that!
"Oh, no!"
Sid!
Get down!
What's gotten into you?
I was...
You are the one that decided to climb into this...
"The claw, it moves."
I have been chosen!
"Farewell, my friends."
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
Yes!
Eat.
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
I thought I heard you...
I th... forget it.
Did you wanna talk about something?
We can talk later.
Let's talk now.
"Lydia, come on!"
Ly... wait!
Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
"If you're wondering about Jackson's real parents, they're about half a mile from here."
In beacon hills cemetery.
I...
I have to get to cl...
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
I didn't see anyone either.
I made it up.
I am not going to drive my son around until he's 40.
The only thing stronger than Manny's fear is his need to protect his mama.
"Oh, no!"
He got away!
"But you did very good, Manny."
That was a frickin' rush!
But we're not giving up.
We're gonna find that guy.
No!
Are you sure about this?
Just go.
I'm walking home.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
Can everybody just shut up?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
- Stop.
"- What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
Is that your hot wife I hear?
"Hey, is she still taking those yoga classes?"
Hanging up.
W-w-wait.
Wait.
Real quick.
"The listing at 225 cedar street, it's mine now."
You poached my listing?
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
Wasn't that enough?
Stop walking around.
"Frankie, go do some homework."
I've done my homework.
Do some reading.
Watch TV.
Do something.
"Grandpa, all I need is the truck."
I know you know that I mean.
"Come on, Ma, let me have the truck."
I got a date!
What do you take me for?
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.
He's cool;
American style.
His parents are Chinese-style cool.
"Frankie likes going out, but they'd rather he work in the store, selling milk and bread and lizards."
Ugh!
"I mean, do I try to interfere with your bookkeeping?"
!
My business is comedy!
That's what I do!
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!
"Yes, you are."
They're the money guys.
"Okay, slippery, bath time's over."
Come out with your hands up.
But I just got in.
"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.
"Mano, Erik!"
Mother!
-Glory!
"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."
"Will be patients, all right."
Where you going?
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.
-Erik.
"-Walk away, she is an athlete."
"Sorry, Erik, I will go faster."
Boadicea!
Which girl impossible!
I'm impossible even.
"-Then, boot to break, girl."
-Yay!
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
Let's go.
"Shiv, we have met before."
In our past life.
What?
I was a princess and you were a warrior.
And we were in love.
What...what...what...
Zak killed you to make me his.
And the same thing is going to repeat again.
"Shiv, are you getting me?"
You lost your life because of me.
"Shiv, we can't be together anymore."
Just...just...just a second.
One second.
"Just give me a second, okay?"
- Listen to me.
"- Just a second, okay?"
Very important.
You nitwit!
Where is your Hidimba!
That bloody old hag!
You ask why am I cussing?
She has made my life hell.
- My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!
"Past life, king and queen and what not she is talking about."
I'll stab her to death if I see her.
Let her know.
What?
I am on the other side of the island.
Wait a second.
Hey!
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Hold me.

"(Danny) Uh-oh, back that shit up."
Enrique mento!
"Hey, Mike!"
Want to bat?
"Come on, Mike!"
Yeah...
Yeah!
Remember how we used to do it?
"Hey, he's gonna mess up the whole flow of the game."
"Dejalo, dejalo..."
Come on.
That's gonna throw everything off.
"Danny, just throw the ball, dude."
"Man, he's gonna take my spot."
All right.
"Remember how we used to do it in little league, right?"
"Choke up on the bat, put your shoulder into it."
"Come on, throw him a nice juicy one so he can smack it!"
"Yo, what if he hits a home run?"
"Yo, just shut up and throw the ball, B."
Okay.
"Ponsela, ponsela!"
"Come on, Michael!"
"Esta seria, aqui."
"Go, go!"
"Go, run it out!"
"Run Michael, run it out, run it out!"
Run!
"It's okay, that's okay."
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
France isn't there.
For three points.
Maybe look for countries.
Belgium?
No.
No...
No...
"Hungary, or...?"
What's the country?
It must be something?
"Yes indeed, it must be something, but you haven't found it."
I'm going to throw it over for a bonus point to the Araucarians?
"Oh, yes, I've got the country."
We think it's Chagall and...
Belarus?
Show me your first letters.
Let's see if you're right.
Yes you are.
Chagall and Belarus.
"Chagall, one of the leading artists of the 20th century, came from Belarus."
Settled in France.
Anyone know the town he was born in a Belarus?
Minsk?
Vitebsk!
"And whenever he did his paintings, he said, ""Whenever I paint,"
"""I'm thinking of Vitebsk."" Anyway, there you are."
"Araucarians, we're with you."
Reveal the hive.
One of them's oxygen?
Oxygen's not there.
I know.
Fluorine.
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."
Really?
Do one more scenario.
"Maggie, you're at your car."
You're fumbling for your keys.
- Okay.
"- Emma, attack."
"Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy..."
- [grunts]
- Ah!
- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.
And that's self defense... [softly] For moms.

I think you snapped my solar plexus.
What?
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?
Right!
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not.
"I am sorry, doc."
I...
I died.
I broke my promise.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.
This boy is gonna die!
Let's do it.
It's a great story.
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right!
Let's go!
Hold it right there.
Here we go.
"One, two, three."
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.
- All set.
- Get a minicam van and meet me at County.
"Here, here."
Close the door.
Let's go!
Patch your headsets back to the station.
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr....
"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?
About everything too.
But it's not the same.
Why not?
On your head!
- What?
- On your...
"look,"
On...
"I'm sorry about that, Mr. Fawlty."
Manuel asked me to give this to you.
Oh!
"Thank you, Polly, and, Polly..."
"Not a word to the dragon, eh?"
- No.

"Oh, Manuel, get some loo paper, muchos, for 22."
"Uh, twent... sí."
Are you blind?
There were on my head all the time.
Didn't you see?
- Yes.
- Didn't God give you eyes?
"Yes, but I don't use 'em, 'cause it wears the batteries out."
Send my paper up immediately.
What's all that?
22.
"Evening, Terry."
"Do you like Cavaliera Rusticana, Terry?"
"I've never had it, Mr. Fawlty."
"You're in a good mood, Mr. Fawlty."
Had a little bit of luck on the gee-gees.
"Not a word to the ""trouble and strife"", eh?"

We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.
"Ludovic, the filming has to stop."

Excuse me?

"- It is called ""boat"". - ""Boot""."
He goes so ...

It's repulsive.

- Maybe you should get it.
- Me?
Come on.
- Maybe you can come some good.
- So what is it that will help?
"- You're a cop, John."
I would be safe.
"- No one is safe benleyken, Rache."
Thank you.
- Where is Mike?
- There were some things he has to do.
- Work like?
"- Yes, I like business."
- You bring me Bella.
"- Yes, I brought."
- Who are you?
- My name is John.
"Brother, I wanted to look after a while."
- Do you always sleep with him?
- His name is Bella.
She is a girl bear.
"- My brother, say I'm too big for him."
- I never would not be very large.
Try to sleep a little.
- Will you tell me a story?
- I do not know any story.
Then we make up one.
My mother does this.
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Long long time ago ...
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor.
Now go before I change my mind.

"Well, the way I see it I could have killed you twice."
The poison and when you were knocked out.
I didn't!
What do you want?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(HOOK LAUGHING)
You are bloody brilliant.
Amazing!
(LAUGHS)
May I see it?
The compass?
It's more beautiful than legend.
(CHUCKLES)
"Come, let's go."
(CLANK)
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Hook, I... (SIGHS) I can't..."
"Emma, look at me."
Have I told you a lie?
"I brought you here, I risked my own safety to help you."
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry!
"Blair, we gotta help her."
"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."

"Connor, shut up."
I'll help her.

"Oh, no no no."
Connor!
Yeah.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
I need this rest.
My tour next month is 20 cities.
- Where are you going?
"- Vienna, Geneva..."
You're going on a tour?
"darling, did I forget to tell you?"

Guests of my wife's.
I won't let her move to Paris so she's trying to bring Paris here.
"still, it's her money."
And I Iove her for it.
(laughs)
"Where are you staying, lad?"
At the inn?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.
I always figure to check out first anyway.
- Why?
- Because that how usually goes for the good ones.
You got a hair dryer?

"Unit 42, respond to dispatch."
You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.

"Oh, yes, I did."
"I asked you to marry me, didn't I?"
On ourfirst date.
I said it because I knew...

At least the roof doesn't leak.
"To your health, my lord."
And your delightful family.
(Lord Meldrum) Thank you.
Do we eat this or is just for ornamentation?
"Give it to Foster, he'll crawl up it."

"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.

Someone else could not.

"I know, Dad."
Do not worry.
You can make it.

In this world there are 2 types of crime.
"I used to did not know it, but now I know."
"In other words, the Wall Street bankers."

Zırvalıklara spend all their money.
People are descendants.
This is the real crime.
They are the real criminals.
Bankers.

What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."

Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Tell us what happened.
"Joe was coming on to me, and I told him no."
And Officer Taggot told him to get lost.
And all hell broke loose.
So who started the fight?
Joe...
I think.
Maybe it was Bobby.
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
"Did Officer Taggot hit you or shove you at any time, even by accident?"
No.
No way.
It wasn't him.
How could you be so sure if it all happened so fast?
"'Cause Roy would never, never..."
Valerie?
"Okay, Valerie?"
Valerie.
Going down is much faster.

Have you lost it man?
I'm not afraid.
"You are not afraid, huh?"
What do you call this?
I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning.
You have another half.
You won't make it in time.
You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible.
"If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember?"
But I will finish in time.
Is this in time?
Can't swim...
"Oh, you're such a pussy."
I can't.
You just don't want to.
Lie back.
That's it.
You're OK.
It's easy.

Bit naughty.
Never mind.

I'd really like to see you out of those clothes.
I'll lend you my cagoule.
Harry.
"What are you doing here, Bea?"
"- Oh, Harry, then you're not..."
- Not what?
"Oh, I don't know."
I had the strangest feeling.
- I thought...
- Yes?
You thought?
That you were going away without ever seeing me again.
"Well, why would I do that, Bea?"
- I love you.
Why...
"- Oh, I know."
"But I lost you for a moment, Harry."
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?
Of course not.
"Well, you see that everything's all right nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was?"
Of course.
- It must have been a dream.
"- Yes, yes, a dream."
You're not angry with me?
Angry?
"Oh, I don't want you to leave me."
Ever.
"Oh, darling."
I love you so much.

There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!
get me out of here!
Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"
That trunk yours...?

"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Do you want to hear about it or not?
Meet me in the kitchen.
"Usually, I lead a very normal life, go to school, hang with friends, see my girl."
"You remember Judy, right?"
Freddie
Judy.
"Yeah, we broke up."
Dumped her.
"-Don't go, Fred."
WOMAN 1:
Operator.
Hello.
Can I please have long distance?
"For long distance, dial 110."
"Oh, all right, thank you."
WOMAN 2:
Long Distance.
Hello?
"Oh, hello, long distance."
"I would like to place a call, please, to Mrs. Karen Blair, that's Colonel Blair's wife, at March Field, California."
"One moment, please."
"Yes, thank you, I'll wait."
Long distance?
Are you still there?
Are you ready for your call?
"Yes, I'm ready."
KAREN:
Hello?
"(MIMICKING GRETCHEN) Karen, darling."
How divine to talk to you again.
It's been a long time.
"Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?"
"Much too long, you naughty girl, you."
We must get together again real soon for a rousing game of mahjong.
"Oh, I'd just love to."
"Oh, by the way, Karen, my dear."
I have an enormous favor to ask of you.
My Bobby...
Booby?
"No, not booby."
Bobby.
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?
I haven't gone this fast in years.
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
Serpentine!
"Serpentine, serpentine!"
What in the blue blazes?
Crazy hot-rodder.
"I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower."
"The sixties weren't good to you, were they?"
What?
That's not the Interstate!
Ah!
Oh!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ow!
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?"
- Incoming!
"- Whoa, man."
- No!
- Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
My tires!
"Fly away, Stanley."
Be free!
"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble."
"We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track."
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
What?
Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
- Shut up!
"So, I'm killing all these girls..."
He's riding next to me wondering who's doing it.
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.
"You've been a very bad boy, fucking your new partner."
"Did you get fucked, honey?"
"Well, Tommy has made a career out of fucking his partners."
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.
"- Bye-bye, Tommy."
- Jimmy!
I like this game.
"Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun."
Now we've got us a game.
"- Say goodbye to her, Tommy."
"- Jimmy, don't do it!"
"- Jimmy, no!"
- Say goodbye to her.
Jimmy!
"Put the gun down, son."
Please.
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
"- What fun would that be, Dad?"
"It's all over, son."
Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.

Paper!
Get your morning paper!

"- I took him, Gus!"
I'll say he took him!
That last right hurt me!
On the table!
"You missed a great bout, Gus!"
"Oh, you should've seen it, Gus!"
Stoker hit him with everything but the bucket!
- He was landing as often as the Marines!
- Boy!
- I'll take care of that!
- Stoker was sharper than eight razor blades!
- He got careless!
- After the third heat!
!
"I know the kid is a gone gosling, an amateur!"
"Somebody yelled, ""Yoo-hoo, Nelson, you dropped your glove!"""
"He sure did, and his duke was in it!"
- There!
- How's that eye?
It's a beaut!
I can't wait to see Nelson's hand!
- Where's Tiny and Red?
- They ain't been in here!
"When I worked there last summer,"
I spent every day jumping JCBs over cement mixers.
"- Well, that's a lie."
- And I got paid a grand at the end.
- Another lie!
- I had a wank earlier
- about your mum's tits.
Is that alle?
- I hope so.
- It's not.
"- Oh, good."
"- Sorry, mate."
- I ain't your fucking mate!
He's touchy.
It's probably cos he's such a short arse!
- What d'you say?
- What?
"- He's taking the piss, Danny."
- Yeah?
I'll fucking do you.
"- Yeah, whatever."
- Wanker.
- What's his problem?
"- Ooh, don't cry, Simon!"
"Yeah, good one."
"Um, catch up in a bit."
"Oh, that's right, run after her, that's not creepy!"
"I may not have received any Valentine's cards, but that didn't mean I hadn't sent any."
Charlotte!
"Oh, hello."
Happy Valentine's day.
Did you get any cards?
- How on earth did you find me?
Your beloved boss.
"Fuck you, Cavit!"
Can?
"It's OKauntie, he's a friend..."
"C'mon girl, I need to go shopping!"
I've nothing left to wear.
Nothing?
As if you ever had anything...
I can buy your entire day.
"It's my photo shoot day, with that German."
Why don't you meet him later?
Then you'll get paid twice!
What's going on?
I can't go out during daylight.
Do I need to talk to yourmom?
Fuck you.
My ass is freezing'...
Swimming in November?
!
No whole wheat?
I called yourmom when you left your phone at the bar...
Why is that?
She was one mean woman.
You idiot!
What did you say?
Don't shout!
"All I said was ""Ahmet"", and she was already yelling..."
Sorry...
My mom is a little bit weird.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Hellooo!
I'll see you later.
"Okay, bye."
- Bye.
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!
You will never touch me again.
"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."
I assure you this late-payment thing will never happen again.
"Yep, just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life."
[BEEPING]
"Oh, that's my other line."
"Okay, bye."
- Hello?
BILL:
"Hi, Gigi?"
This is Bill.
- Bill?
- Alex's friend.
We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
"Bill, so you do exist."
I do.
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."

I'll file for a dna search warrant.

Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."

Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.

"You sure can pick 'em, Doyle."
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.
"For Christ's sake, move the car!"
What the hell is goin' on here?

Any doctor's OK.
All I know is I'm pissing blood.
He's hurt!
You fix him up or I'll smash your head in.
Get it?
Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky.
Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.
"Don't worry, just hand over your dough."
I don't have any on me I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
"No, thanks."
- Mother of Mercy.
"- Yeah, we were just leaving."
I don't blame you.
Who is this guy?
A very colorful dead end.
Where's Natalie?
She's downstairs.
She's signing autographs.
"You hate this, don't you?"
- What?
- Natalie getting all the attention.
"- No, I'm happy for her."
- Sure you are.
It's good for her.
She deserves it.

I can tell.
You used to be the superstar.
Now you're Garfunkel.

"Yes, love, did you notice?"
"Naughty, naughty children!"
RUN!

"In your head, melt her."
I can't!
I'm getting impatient!
You have been VERY naughty!
What about the man?
"You said the man was here, the cloud man."
"Well, he's not, is he?"
Where's the Doctor?
I don't know!
Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
There you go.
Set yourself up for that one.
WOMAN:
OK.
"We're going to get liquor, liquor, liquor. [laughs]"
We're on our way to the junkyard scene.
"[Inaudible] got to be drunk, but we have no liquor."
And you got ID?
"Because underneath your makeup and mask,"
I can't tell-- not that I'd be able to tell-- [laughs]
What the hell's the difference?
"Hey, honey, how am I gonna be able to tell if it's him"
Anyway. [laughs]
MAN:

Look at their ID.

"It's like, (SLURRING) oh, fucking, shite."
At least you had an idea.
I didn't know which goddamn way
To go.
Yeah.
"You know, Lou, you know when"
"I get stuck like that, there's"
Only two people who's lead I'd
Follow in a heartbeat.
That's you and Tommy.
"You've saved my ass, goddamn I"
Don't even know how many times.
So tonight you didn't.
Yeah.
"That's all you gotta say,"
Is yeah?
Uh-Huh?
"No sweat, man."
"Hey, buddy."
Where's the mustard?
Thanks very much.
"You know something, pal?"
"You got to lose, like, 75 pounds."
"Seriously, bro."

I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.
This is all we've got.
One price for all.
And here's some fuse.
Keep the change.
You have a slow leak.
"Guido, he fix."
You make-a such a nice new road.
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.
Even though you not a Ferrari.
"You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare"
- absolutely free!
"- Look, I get all my tires for free."
"I like your style, eh?"
You drive the hard bargain.
OK.
Luigi make you a new deal.
"You buy one tire, I give you three for free!"
"Oh, would you look at that?"
"Ramone, Ramone!"
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.
"No, no, no, no."
Deal me out.
Pass.
"No, thank you."
"- No, no, no, no."
No.

My last offer.
"You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!"
Done.
"You interested, you call me."
You know where I am.
Ah!
Stop!
Let me...
You're a beautiful girl.
You know that?
That's what they love around here.
They need girls like you.
"And with me in your corner, you're in like Flynn."
"Thanks a lot for helping, really."
Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.
I like to be thanked.
No.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to."
Come on.
Get off me.
Don't play hard to get.
Get away.
Get off me!
I don't mind if you don't.
Get back.
Get away!
"Come on, we're gonna trade favors."
Tit for tat.

Definitely not a funny way to die.
Crockett I though!
t you were off.
Since when has that mattered?
Who's in the bag?
Morty Price.
The comic?
He got a nice slice from a steak knife.
Definitely not a funny way to die.

Where are the coins?
[Groans] I don't have them.
They were taken from me.
Give me his name.
Farley Kolt.
Kolt does not have them.

Captain?
"Listen, I'm not sure he's home."
I'm going to get the key from the super.
Stay here.
"What kind of person do you think I am, to bring me here?"
"It's immoral, unethical and a bad example to the common people."
What a lovely bottom!
"Brother Foon, what's brought you here?"
I've missed you.
- Really?
- Marshal?
Marshal?
Shall we go?
"Since we're here, I want to find out if they employ any underage girls."
"- Come on, drink up."
"- OK, I'll drink up."
- Drink.
- OK.
"Mousy, relax."
You've gone red.
It's because I drank too much wine.
You've been drinking soya sauce!
- Open your mouth!
- Have another cup!
I want to talk to this girl.
- What are you doing?
- Stop there!
- What do you want?

It's your big shot.
You gotta take it.

Then what's the problem?
"I'm not coming back, Mrs. Shaw."
"Hi, sweetheart."
- Are you managing?
- I'm okay.
He's been calling all morning.
- I don't ever want to talk to him.
- No.
- Would you like some breakfast?
- No thanks.
- I need some breakfast.
"- Yes, you do."
- Want anything?
- A glass of juice maybe.
What a little asshole.
What a stupid little boy.
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course I came.
I'll get a room though so I don't have to commute.
"I brought my teddy bear pajamas, some cookies and a glass of water   sloshing about in my bag."
I haven't been in Copenhagen this often since university.
I delivered papers.
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.

Things get too busy on the couch to call?
I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

You're a perfect wife.

Let go of her.
This is a shoot.

I'll miss out on my tv programme.
Don't you watch Mtv?
"Drop me, please"
Where have you brought me?
Why here... in a haunted house?
Haunted house!
Come in

It's all a sham!

Wrong

Did your parents object?
Only Om objected
Who are these guys?

You are the scapegoat
I want you to meet Agesha my sister-in-law to-be
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
"But you'll be there, right?"
Tuesday night?
Of course.
"Take the 11:40 bus, okay?"
Anything later on a weekday will get you in too late.
Especially with traffic.

"[Cassie] Well, look at you."
You're looking good.
"What do you got, like, a court appearance later?"
"[Edgar] Oh, that's hilarious, Cass."
"Hey, what's the statute of limitations on lame?"
"[Cassie] Oh, they fucked the funny out of you in prison?"
[Edgar] [mock laughs] Like I said.

I guess we're following Edgar now.

"I've never followed Edgar anywhere, and I--"
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr. Vega.
Hey!
Benigno.
Hey!
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said goodbye to Lydia.
OCR failed!
but Dr. Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
I'll read them to Alicia at night.
They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
Are you going alone?
Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
About what?
Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
I got a car.
Them wheels are yours?
Come on.
"What do you mean, come on?"
What's your name?
"Miko's the name, pedalling's the game."
How can I help?
- You know the Greenbergs?
- Yeah.
"Just yesterday, they takin' tourists..."
"I mean, doin' business."
You know what I mean?
"And today, pau'ana."
- They say anything about taking a vacation?
- Saul take a vacation?
- You gotta be kidding.
- I know what you mean.
Tom?
This guy says that Saul and Lena closed the place early last night.
"This morning, the place was for sale."
There was no answer from them this morning.
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.
- Let's run by their house.
"- You find anything, let me know."
- I like them old haoles.
"- Mahalo, brah."
"Thanks, brah."
Saul said they were taking a vacation.
- We're meddling.
- We're not.
- We are so.
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
Just around the block.
Yeah.
Just around the block.
"And be careful, okay?"
I will.
Bye.
I-It-
- It's really--
"It's really great to have you home, Mom."
"Hey, seriously, be careful, okay?"
I will.
Okay.
I guess we should talk.
"Oh, I think you said plenty the other day."
No.
"Look, about that, it just--"
Did you get the car wash keys?
"Um, yes, yes."
"Skyler, I may have... overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward."
But I-
- I just--
I want you to know something.
I want you to--
I need you to understand that you are safe.
"You, Junior, Holly--"
You are completely safe.
Everything that I do-- Everything--
I do it to protect this family.
"So buying that car, that was protecting your family?"
Okay.
"I, uh--"
"All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car, and--"
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
Tell me.
What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!
Interesting?
"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!
Master!
Reward!
Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
Get away.
"Give me, what I need now is this."
I'll go to the ladies!
She recovered even before putting it on!
Must be very potent?
Darling!
Wait for me here!
Don't go away. I'll go put some on.
Save some for me!
The Formula is in the smallest tooth-brush.
Burglar...!
Stop drinking.
You'll get drunk!
I've been sober these last 3 years.
Useless!
Has he ever been sober?
You again?
Don't stand there.
I'd never ask you to dance.
I feel like dancing with someone handsome!
Me?
"Sam, the record's stuck!"
"Watch it, don't get fresh!"
It's you who's getting fresh.
Damn you!
- l feel dizzy!
- Me too!
How much does Fat Pig pay you?
Such awful taste!
I had worse taste 3 years ago!
Fat Pig is a traitor.
You'd marry a traitor?
"You'll get your ID card, then you can tell your lovely Harald all."
He will make you forget everything.
Forget?
What can he make me forget?
I have nothing but hate left for him.
"But I won't let him forget, I'll show him"
He's in for a shock when he sees what he's done to me.
Hold on for a minute!
What is it?
Get dressed and hurry away!
My brother-in-law.
Damn!
Is there nobody here?
"You're sleeping in broad daylight, right?"
"But not in my underwear, Karl!"
"Also, still cheeky!"
I drove through the night.
And you've arrived 3 days too late.
Father John!
What?
- I said:
Father John!
Are you crazy?
Told you:
Not in my underwear!
In what hospital is she then?
Hospital?
The birth took place here.
Karl!
Mommy!
"You have a son, Mr John!"
Why is he in such a hurry?
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!
- Fifty bucks!
- I didn't get any...
- I bet you didn't!
- Hold it!
You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!
- What kind?
- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !
13 with three cents to the governor!
That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
But I thought maybe we could make an exception.
Or not.
"You are not helping your cause here, son."
"Stand down, or--"
Or what?
You'll send me to my room?
And I'm not your son.
I'm not even his.
I thought I was his partner.
But not anymore.
Guess they're right about you three.
You're not ready.
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Superman to Justice League.
There's been an explosion at Project Cadmus.
It's on fire.
I've had my suspicions about Cadmus.
This may present the perfect opportunity to--
ZATARA:
Zatara to Justice League.
The sorcerer Wotan is using the Amulet of Aten to blot out the sun.
Requesting full League response.
-Superman?
-It's a small fire.
-Local authorities have it under control
-Then Cadmus can wait.
All Leaguers rendezvous at Zatara's coordinates.
Batman out.
-Stay put.
-What?
Why?
This is a League mission.
What about us?
"It's always Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time."
"You can't change things now, Anna."
Hello?
Why are you sitting here?
Sweetheart!
It's lovely to see you.
- I can't stand it when we fight.
- Me neither.
But we need to talk about this properly.
- Yes.
- Like grown ups.
"- Of course, sweetie."
- So stop calling me sweetie.
- What can I call you then?
- You could call me Anna.
Okay.
Did you marry Jorgen for my sake?
So that I had a father?
No.
I love Jorgen.
Do you?
A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hyo-jin?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
Vibrant!
Superb!
So glad to hear it!
"- Tony, are you OK?"
"- I'm top-notch, buddy."
Enjoying your night out?
Me too.
"Hey, Nips."
"- Don't call her Nips, Tony."
"- Why, what you gonna do?"
"I'm, uh, objecting."
Strongly.
- Come on...
"- Tony, what are you doing?"
"Isn't she pretty, hey man?"
Tony.
You two make such a sweet couple!
Out of all the world's famous lovers
- Anthony and Cleopatra...
"Taylor and Burton, Jordan and Peter..."
Stop it.
Bert and Ernie...
I would say that you two are quite possibly the greatest snog history has so far encountered.
"What is wrong with you, Tony?"
Are you OK?
What is it with you people and the concept of OK?
"I mean, we're a fucking threesome, aren't we?"
You know... peas in a pod.
"A fucking family, that's what we are."
D'you need to sit down?
Just calm down.
No...
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?
- No!
No!
- On the hood right there.
"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.
"Sir, is Singamuthu's son a fool like you to come here?"
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
This is a fucking waste of time.
Mary Ann:
"Yeah, you shut your mouth."
This is all because of you.
Because you had to stay out late.
- It's not my fault.
"- If I don't get us out of here, you have no idea what's going on--"
- It's not my fault you don't know how to fight back.
"- Horace, go, go, go."
Okay.
- Wait a sec.
- God.
- Honey.
Sylvie.
"- Hi, Aunt Abby."
"- God, here, please, Sylvia, take your brother out to the car right now."
- What?
- Where are we going?
"- This better be for real, Mom."
- Take your brother out.
Abby:
"Shut up, Sylvie."
"- Go, go."
- Okay.
"- Oh, my God."
- What about Pete?
"- My bag, my bag."
"- No, no, no--"
"- No, Mom, forget your stuff, just come."
"- Mary Ann, Mary Ann, just come now."
"- No, wait, I'll be right there, I'll be one second."
"- Okay, hurry up!"
Doo-dah doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night
Goin' to run all day
Gonna bet me money on the bobtail nag...
I did it my way.
Can't stand Frank Sinatra.
"""You make me feel so young""."
Rubbish.
"You seem very jolly, Basil."
Hmm?
You seem very jolly.
Jolly?
"Yes, jolly."
Sort of... happy.
"Oh, happy."
"Yes, I remember that."
"Not that I noticed, dear, no."
"I'll report it if it happens, though."
"Well, you look happy to me, Basil."
"No, I'm not, dear."
"All that dancing about, singing and rubbing your hands."
"Just my way of getting through the day, dear."
The Samaritans were engaged.
I thought maybe you were in love.
Hah!
"Only with you, light of my life."
Or had a bit of luck or something.
"Did Mr. Hawkins deliver the tonics, Terry?"
"Yes, he did, Mrs. Fawlty."
Manuel!
Manuel!
"Oh, your horse, it win!"
"I think you hit it again, sir."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"Ready when you are, Mr. Fowler."
Be right there.
"Oh, sir, if you didn't think I was gonna be in the way,"
I would love to...
No.
Not at all.
Be my guest.
"Oh, thank you very much, sir."
I appreciate that.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I don't wanna appear grabby, but do you think I could have one of these, sir?"
Certainly.
As many as you want.
That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
- But he's coming this way.
- [Tia] who is he?
- [muscles] our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
"[Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
[dazzler] let's go.
[all] yeah!
That's our hideout.
[stairs creaking]
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?
[Rocky] don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
[gasps]
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough"
If you take orders from your mom or older sister.
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
[crusher] yeah.
- Tony!
- [boys] where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
Shh.
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
Shh!
Can we spend some time together?
You're so beautiful.
- You're not serious.
"- No, you're really beautiful."
I envy you.
"- Please, stop."
You're much prettier.
- Not at all.
- How old are you?
- How about you?
Thirty-one.
I'm older.
You are?
Then I should call you Big Sis?
How did you meet Joongrae?
It was just a coincidence.
He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.
Who told you that?
The restaurant owner told me.
That man always talks crap.
Check your bank account.
Your money's back.
[WHISPERS] It's Georgina.
"[IN NORMAL VOICE] Georgina, where are you?"
What happened to Poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
"You got your money, that's all that matters."
- Now you can go to Yale.
"- Well, I'm going to NYU now."
"Oh, great."
Then I'll see you next year.
"Wait, what does that mean?"
[PHONE HANGS UP]
Wait-
- Hello?
Georgina?
What?
- Georgina Sparks?
"- Yes, that's right."
I recently enrolled in Gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
"Thank you, Ms. Sparks."
- Is there anything else?
- I'd like to request a roommate.
Blair Waldorf.
"She's my best friend, and I just can't wait to live with her."
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in Dubai?
You know you can't lose me for long.
Where you headed?
Everywhere.
- West Virginia?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
"Yes, talk me?"
Talk me?
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Mr. Klein.
Hello.
I want to speak with you.
Ok.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
- What?
- Yeah.
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.
I know what age I am.
Don't start getting snotty with me.
I should be getting snotty with you.
Sorry.
"It's shocking, that is."
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?
"Well, what do you think?"
I don't know.
"I should give out, I suppose... or throw a wobbler or something... but what's the point?"
"I mean, if she was..."
You should have come to us earlier.
"Before, you know, when... said you were gonna get pregnant... then we could've done something about it."
My God.
"You're positive, now?"
Absolutely certain?
Shh.
"Molly, my Irish Molly"
Good girl.
What's that on your face?
Shaving foam.
Oh.
"Well, fair enough."
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Who was it?
- Was it?
"Fucking hilarious, he totally did you."
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.
"Not gonna chuck him out for that, just a scuffle."
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.
- What?
"- They don't look twelve, to be fair."
"Fucking hell Si, you muppet."
We are so dead.
What?
Dead?
That should be the end of it!
"Simon's taken a beating, a child's honour's been restored."
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.
This is Northwood.
"It's not the end, it's the start!"
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?
- Is she hard?
"- No, she'll get them thrown out!"
"I'll go find her, you go and hide somewhere."
- Hide?
"- Yes, hide."
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
I always get these things right!
No thanks.
"Yeah, no thanks."
"But, I really can tell the future!"
"Right, Saho?"
!
"You smell nice, Saho-san."
Ah!
That smell is incense.
I love it.
"The smell is great, and it is interesting to watch the smoke rise."
It makes me feel really relaxed.
Yeah!
I have been getting into incense lately myself!
Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!
"Oh man, Fumi!"
You really are doing whatever your teacher does!
Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?
Sorry for visiting you at such a busy time.
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'.
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live.
"Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy."""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
You lost your hair.
- Yes all.
Your beautiful hair.
- But you found your belly.
"Oh, my friend."
My crazy brother.
Who are these people?
- My crew.
"Nicky, the sound engineer."
"Carlos, operator help."
"Our manufacturer, Ludo."
"And Louise, my assistant."
- Hello.
"Boys, this is a special man and my dear friend."
What are you doing here?
Let's make a program about Turkey entering Europe.
"Excuse me, are the phones working here in Serbia?"
Where is she from?
- From Belgium.
Belgium?
"Maybe he does not know, but his country is a coat."
"Yes, we know it."
- What a pity.
You are at the center of Europe and you do not know how to keep your mini-country together.
Nor is his country a good example.
"Ignore, Dragan."
"- He is right, I like it."
"We are mythical matter, Lady Louise."
The Balkans are the Balkans.
There is love.
I hate it.
It's love.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
Please listen to me.
I'm a doctor.
I'm on your side.
I'm on the president's side.
I can tell you where the guerrilleros are.
I saw them marching towards San Juan.
We'll see about that.
Call the Capitán.
- Come on!
"- Hurry, over there."
We need more material.
Hurry up.
"You need to work faster, come on."
Unit 3!
There's someone lying there.
Let's see if he's still alive.
Careful.
There's another one down there.
Fire!
There are even more of them!
Come over here!
I always come at the right time.
Where's Smithy?
He stayed down there.
I lost sight of him.
It all happened so fast.
- Do you think he's dead?
"- If he isn't, I hope they won't get him."
"- Come on, get up there."
- Hurry up.
Come on.
I wonder what your father would have said about this ruckus.
"Yes, of my aunt, by the one of the rent."
"One does not worry about the rent, we can reach an agreement."
That is what worries me.
By the way.
"It has called a friend of yours, a certain Sandro."
"He has said that it is very urgent, must call to him immediately."
I have pointed its number here.
-I can use your telephone?
"-Please, you can use everything you want."
-The hand.
-It pardons.
"yes, whats up."
"Benito, you must save me, you must help me."
My belly.
What?
Higher speech.
I do not hear you.
"I need the wee-wee the 22, the one of Sandokan, is urgent."
What?
wee-wee?
wee-wee?
!
Why I serve the wee-wee to you?
Wee-wee Why I serve to you?
For the analyses.
It dates haste.
Disgusting.
"Ah, for the analyses."
"The 22, Sandokan."
"Yes, in agreement."
Sandro.
Sandro.?
"You know, i thought it might be him."
Oh.
"Well, what happened?"
Did you come to any conclusions about anything while you were out?
Mmm.
"I'm okay, ma."
I'm really okay.
- You sure?
Talk to me.
- I...
I just feel like...
Remember saul on the road to damascus.
Of course.
I used to read you that story.
Do you remember when god struck him and he went blind?
- Yes.
Yes.
- He went blind for three days
"And then when he came back,"
You remember how he saw the error of his ways?
"Mm-Hmm, yes."
"Well, i was running today..."
- Mm-Hmm.
- ...and i was trying to clear my head.
"I was trying to hear from god, mama..."
- Oh.
- ...and i just started looking at people going by.
I saw this mother.
She was playing with her kids.
She was pushing her child on the swing.
"And, mama, that..."
The mother looked like
You killed Jerry the bookie with a bat?
It's not like a half mil is gonna hurt you with that lottery ticket.
"- Get me the money, Russ."
- Ohh!
"Great, Gig."
We gotta talk about this.
"I'll fuckin' ball-bat you, you creep cock sucker."
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
[ Coughing ]
- Mint Listerine?
- Yeah.
- When did they come out with this?
- I don't know.
- Is it good?
"- Yeah, it's good."
[ Tires Screeching ]
"Look, just give this Dale guy a little extra money."
- It's better than losing it all.
- Better than being dead too.
"Crystal, he hits people with commemorative bats!"
He's not gonna hit you with a bat.
He's your friend.
- What?
- Wanna see the jacket i got?
He's not my friend.
I just met this guy.
How can he be my f -
- Look - $900.
- [Sighs]
Made in Italy.
I'm not screwing around anymore.
(THUDDING)
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'll see each other again
- real soon.
- (CAR STARTS)
If you're gonna stay here you gotta keep better track of yourself.
Sheesh.
"Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know, a bedtime story or something."
I've got some really cool ones.
"MAD Magazine, (LAUGHS) very funny."
"The Spirit, very cool."
Boy's Life...
Ehh...
"Oh, here."
This guy is Superman.
"Sure, he's famous now,"
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not like you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.
(STOMACH GROWLS)
"- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?"
"Look, he's been through a lot."
"Just don't break his heart, OK?"
"Oh, my God!"
I just...
You know...
Wh...
What can I say to you to make you understand that we are not together?
"You know, if you don't believe me, you can ask..."
Ask my boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?
"- Yes, I do."
It's a very serious...
I love him.
"I'm sorry, I..."
I guess it was just a misunderstanding.
Mm.
- I'll let you settle in.
"- Yeah, OK."
And please feel free to spread the word.
No.
Listen to this.
"""Spend two weeks at a sixteenth century Tuscan farmhouse."
"Each night, you prepare an authentic Italian meal learning from local chefs."""
Wow.
Interested?
Two weeks cooking?
"What part of ""vacation"" do you not understand?"
- Are you expecting a fax?
"- Well, no."
"I mean, yes."
I am.
My papers from my office.
You're one of those rich computer twins.
Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood.
You brought me back to save you.
Otto:
The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated.
[Gunshot]
"You hang on, all right?"
You hang on!
I should have gone to your ball games.
I should have...
I should have been better to your mom.
Duval:
He's dying.
He said you could fix him.
I'll meet you at the gate.
"No, we're coming in together."
No more lies.
Why does he think he's my father?
Because he is.
No.
"No, no, no, no."
"No, it can't be."
It is.
It is not.
It's impossible.
This doesn't happen.
It...
it... it never happens.
"If by ""it"" you mean me, it's happened."
Look at me.
You know who I am.
- Shut up.
Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Thepresident'swithme.
"This guy, Stenz.."
made multiple calls to a secure line in D. C..
but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.
Really?
Did you check Walker's personal records?
"His computer, his emails?"
"You don't know Walker, John."
He was a dinosaur.
The man still used a pager.
"Oh, shit."
Listen.
"Carol, I got to check something out."
We'll see you outside.
I don't believe it.
"I think I know how Walker got the codes, but I'm gonna need your help, sir."
Move back!
Move back.
Emily.
"Oh, baby, you okay?"
"Oh, thank God."
"Thank God, baby."
Did you see my routine?
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
"You were beautiful, baby."
You saved us.
You know that?
"Hey, stay with Mommy for a second, okay?"
We just got back off tour.
"- You had a band, didn't you?"
- We're Silicone Valets.
"- You didn't teach these Flop Idols, did you?"
"- Yeah, tried to."
For me sins.
"- Too rebellious to teach, us."
"Weren't we, Miss?"
- No.
Just too thick.
"- Do us a quarter, will ya, Moz?"
"- Oh, two quarters for me."
Cheers.
"Quarters, eh?"
You are doing well.
"Oh, yeah."
Now who's thick?
Keep the change.
"Well, you completely cleared me out."
I'm gonna have to have a major restock.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Ah, well, better get back."
- Nice to see you both.
- Yeah.
"Oh, actually this is our first EP."
"It's called ""Exhibit A""."
Thanks.
"Hope the teaching works out, Miss."
"Yeah, I know I couldn't handle a load of kids screaming' at me every day."
"No, 'cause that's for successful bands, i'nt it?"
Bye.
"All right, fella?"
Chah Bahar targeted.
Confirm Chah Bahar.
Go!
"Leave, leave, leave!"
"No, no!"
Not without my dad!
"Go, go, go!"
Your little bitch says you're gonna put me in jail!
"Come on, Martin."
This isn't you.
You protected presidents for the past 25 years.
What are you gonna do?
You really gonna shoot me?
All right.
Yes.
He deserved it.
You killed him!
Get back.
Get over here.
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!
And do as you're told.
"Go on, sit down!"
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!
"No jail for you, you little bitch!"
No!
No!
Get it off!
There was an enormous explosion in the vicinity of the West Wing.
A huge ball of flames has burst into the sky.
It'sgotto be morethan100feet..
"Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear."
"Delta 26, copy that."
"Don't yell, Quico."
You'll wake everyone up.
"Get back here, please."
Did you like the private tutor?
Math is a little hard.
"If you have any trouble here in school, Maria, you can see me."
Let's meet your classmates.
- Come on.
- Wait...
Get the ball.
You get it!
This is howwe walk.
Can I try?
"No, Quico!"
That's not how you do it.
"You look beautiful, beautiful..."
"Frontwards, backwards, and slide... and a smile for the audience, you look great, perfect!"
I am ready to walk up there with you?
"The tightrope walkers, Márcia and Marcelo!"
- I Love you.
- Me too.
"Barbuda, you look lovely."
Let's get going now.
We go in after the acrobats.
"Foguinho, relax or you'll throw me off."
"Go away, great."
You look wonderful.
"Maria, my love!"
- Can I help you?
- Hi.
Grandma's here to see you.
Give grandma a kiss.
At least the dimensions are stabilised.
"""8-9."
"""9-A."
"-""E-7..."""
-E-9.
"Sorry, E-9."
"""2-3..."" Wait!"
Wait!
Did you say E-9?
"Look, it says E-7 there."
You're right.
And the next three numbers are wrong.
This way.
"The Tardis isn't much use to anybody that size, stable or not."
-It gives us time.
-Time to do what?
We don't even know if he's alive in there.
They've arrested the dimension spiral.
Things are looking up.
This is the street.
The error should be somewhere here.
-Sabotage.
-Murder.
Interfering with the working of Logopolis.
The most dangerous crime in the universe.
An error in the dimension subroutine.
Somewhere here.
I will not be beaten.
I simply will not be beaten.
But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside.
"We must return to the Central Register, quickly."
The Monitor's done it.
"- Well, well, well!"
You ready for one more ass-whupping?
!
You're going down!
"I will not fight you, Stinkmeaner."
"Say what, nigga?"
!
You not gonna fight?
!
Then why'd you come?
!
"Nigga, you could've told me you's a bitch over the phone!"
I came because I'm not afraid of you!
But I'm tired of acting like a nigga!
I'm an old man.
I'm dignified.
I watch PBS.
All y'all should be ashamed!
This has gone too far!
"Now, I've already called the police, so everyone should just go home!"
"Come on, fight, old man!"
Fight!
"Aw, hey!"
Ruined everything!
"This ain't over, Robert!"
"We got your back, Stinkmeaner!"
- It worked.
- It worked.
Hey!
"Ed Wuncler, my favorite billionaire!"
What can I do for you?
"Well, I heard about your little incident, and I wanted to see if you were okay."
"Billy, I could bust through this really easy, but it would cause a mess."
"So, what I could do is--"
"I can get the molding off, and I think that's the way to go."
[opens knife]
Are you all right in there?
"Well, we got a little problem here, but"
"I""ll get you out."
"Just stay calm in there, remember, most accidents happen in the home."
There it is.
I don't believe that they use doors like this.
I'll get you out.
As easy as pie.
Be careful of that water now.
when you're in the desert.
I'll have you out of there in a second.
There we go.
Now just one little push and we're home free.
Help!
Help!
Help!
[car starts]
Billy?
"Where are you, Billy?"
Come on out.
Let's play.
[singing indistinctly]
"I miss you, Daddy."
Daddy!
"Oh, Billy!"
Billy!
Billy?
Billy!
That too without a weapon.
"Baby, in this life, I am the tiger."
Got it?
I'll bite if someone tries to touch me.
- Tiger?
- Yes.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
What?
"Everything's set, right?"
"Yes, everything is set."
I'll take a plane and go straight to Budapest.
From there I'll go to the embassy and then I'll come to get you.
"Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the water."
And no one has seen my face so there is nothing to worry about.
Everything will be...
- You are scared.
- Very scared.
Scoundrel...
I too am scared.
- You look after yourself in the boat.
- I will.
We will take Lord's name.
everything will be fine.
Shiv...
- What?
She is You.
One should be ready to face danger for her.
"You take care of yourself, got it?"
You are my life.
Let's go?
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
He saved Ben.
- We're his parents.
How is he?
- It's too soon.
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
- That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
- You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.
"Lily, go get Benton."
- Mark needs you for bypass access.
- Got to stop the bleeding first.
Thoracotomy tray.
Now!
- We'll go to the waiting room.
"- No, I wanna stay."
"No, we have to go."
It's from Laverne.
"- Corporal, can I have my letter, please?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Here, Father."
- Oh.
[Moaning] Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
"- Good morning, Klinger."
"- Good morning, darling."
"- Come again, snookums?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"I'm sorry, sir."
It's a letter from Laverne.
Laverne... the ex-missus who left you high and dry for that butcher boy?
Morty's a sausage maker.
That's below butcher in the Toledo social register.
"But everything's changed now, sir."
Listen to what I read so far.
"""Dear Maxie, You are much in my mind these days."
"""Taking up with Morty was a terrible mistake."
"The man's soul is made of animal by-products."""
"Guess that makes you feel pretty happy, huh?"
- Seeing the sausage king put through the old grinder.
"- It's more than that, sir."
Can't you read between the lines?
She wants me back.
"Oh, that's music to my eyes!"
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
Good night.
"John, you knew that."
Quite some time has passed.
Therapy How's it going?
"- Now I'm a new man, Father."
- I can see that.
- House is sold?
- No.
"Satmalısın House, John."
You have to continue life.
"Which hayatmış this, Father?"
- God works in mysterious ways.
- Now it is doing?
I can not understand.
Why?
Why come here at You're bothered that the candles burning?
- Because he would have done.
"- Anna would have done, because he believed."
"- Flame, a symbol of his faith believed that."
- Yes.
Well ...
I also drink it.
"Sometimes I'm thinking, God, I have chosen, or Does God he chose me."
"Because if he opted me, the error could have done."
"Hey, Father."
It relaxes you a little bit.
- Then I will see you on Sunday?
- No ...
- My mom says I vereceklermiş a medal.
I'm very proud of.
"- I'll be safe, John."
"I love you, Daddy."
You're about to meet someone very special.
♪♪♪
(sigh)
Mr. Connor.
Detective Murdoch.
He... he is a miracle.
Meet your son...
Roland.
- (Roland laughing)
"- He's a... he's a lovely little man, and it's been our honour to care for him."
You are the very best of people.
I have some things for him that you might find useful.
I'll arrange to have them sent over.
I cannot thank you enough times.
I wish you a long and happy life together.
(Roland babbling)
(touching music)
(Julia sobbing briefly)
(Julia gasping)
(Julia crying)
Announcer:
On an all-new Murdoch...
Solving a secret code.
This is why he was murdered.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I want to see what he saw.
Announcer:
"This time, going undercover..."
"Bloody, copper!"
Announcer:
Isn't what it's cut out to be.
"Murdoch Mysteries, next Monday at 8:00 on CBC."
"Oh, we can."
And we will.
He's in the junkyard.
"McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road."
The junkyard.
Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.
"I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth."
It isn't really happening.
This is only a bad dream.
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)
MANSLEY:
Where's the giant?
(ECHOING) This is only a bad dream.
MANSLEY:
"Yes, sir."
"This thing is real, sir."
"I not only have incontrovertible evidence, General,"
I know where it's hidden.
"I don't know who built it, but it's here."
It's massive and we're running out of time.
There's no doubt we should act.
"The only question, sir, is..."
Can you afford not to?
"Excellent, sir."
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, sir."
"The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth."
Don't get cute.
I gotta warn Dean.
I'll be watching you.
(AWAKES WITH A START)
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
But it's not just your legs.
I'm crazy about that little nose of yours.
That cute little button of a nose.
"Hey, Animal."
Animal.
I've been crazy about you for years.
"I've seen every picture you ever made, six times."
"I'd just sit there, watching you."
I wouldn't even open up the popcorn bag.
Animal.
"Animal, wake up."
Wake up.
Betty.
Betty.
"Animal, this is me, Harry Shapiro."
Harry Shapiro!
Harry.
Cut the music!
Cut the music!
Cut it!
At ease.
At ease.
Somebody cover the doors.
"Now, listen."
The men are here to pick up Dunbar.
They're taking him to Berlin.
"They got the proof, looks like he's finished."
Only he's not finished yet.
Hoffy and I figured out a long shot.
I've got all the barracks behind us.
- What are you gonna do?
-Get that smudge pot.
"Father, please wake up!"
Father!
Father!
Chun-su...
Are you all right?
You should've just let them take the dam salt!
Why did you fight?
"That's salt is our livelihood, and I won't be robbed of it."
"I have to get you married off, and..."
What's more important than your life?
I'm sorry...
"I'm your father, and I have nothing but poverty and hardship to leave behind..."
"Stop that, Father."
"Chun-su, look under the ashes in the furnace."
The Furnace...
Father!
Chun-su...
My dear boy Chun-su...
Father...!
Father...!
Why didn't just give it to them?
Why didn't he?
That old fool!
What's more important than his life?
Why didn't he get treatment when he had all this?
That fool!
That idiot!
That old fool!
I won't let them get away with this!
Father...!
Father...!
My poor Father...!
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing withoutJeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
Hey!
Don't shoot!
It's me!
Somebody's aiming at my ass from below!
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!
Ow!
Stop!
Ow!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ow!
-
- What's going on?
-
"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
But it's...
"Look at it, it's..."
"Go on, say it, most people do."
It's smaller on the outside!
"OK, that is a first."
Is it magic?
Is it a machine?
It's a ship.
A ship?
Best ship in the universe.
Is there a kitchen?
Another first.
"I don't know why I asked that, it's just..."
I like making souffles.
Souffles?
!
Why are you showing me all this?
"You followed me, remember"
- I didn't invite you.
You're nearly a foot taller than I am.
You could've reached the ladder without this - you took it for me.
Why?
I never know why.
I only know who.
What's this?
Me.
Giving in.
I don't know why I'm crying...
I do.
"Remember this - this right now, remember all of it."
"Because this is the day, this is the day, this is the day everything begins."
Clara!
It's not just a game.
Not to me.
I can see that.
"Where were you a week ago, Monday, sir?"
"A week ago, Monday."
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
"Uh, excuse me?"
I was here.
Like always.
Watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
"Do you own a pair of scissors, Mr. O'Dwyer?"
Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please?"
How about some metallic paint?
Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Marissa Kessler?
"Well, you do have her picture up all over the wall."
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lotto girls."
Jackpot winners.
People who work there.
Secretaries.
Gaffers.
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I publish a newsletter.
A lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
"It was hot, you wouldn't believe."
And dressed completely in black...
"In the supermarket, you can ask my wife..."
Him in shorts.
"carrying his son, behind him wife and daughter dressed head to toe in black."
- Leaving a trail of sweat behind...
- The smell was horrible.
People who deny it... lie to themselves.
Or they are simply stupid.
- They are centuries...
- They've had bad experiences...
They are centuries behind.
- 500 years.
- 300.
Sweetheart.
My little baby.
My Emmi mouse.
You little darling.
"You're so big now, you can hug Mommy."
That feels so good.
Little sweetheart.
My sweet little mouse.
My teeny-tiny sweet little mouse.
We don't want you to get cold.
You're my pretty princess in white.
My princess.
I'm so happy I have you.
Mommy's always with you.
Mommy always comes.
That's right.
"Hello, I'm home."
"Yeah, what is it?"
Do you think I'm a magician?
New York City is a big place.
How am I supposed to find Alex Bohemia?
Kind of like finding a penguin in a sandstorm.
You sure you got the right address?
You boys think this is Atlantic City?
"Jeremy, pick up your milk money and get inside!"
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for-
"You're in the wrong neighborhood, man!"
I'm looking for a family.
Maybe-
Wack accent!
"You way out of your 'hood, white boy."
You crazy or what?
Or maybe you're a cop?
Hey!
"Get the hell out from my building, you little shits!"
"Come on, old man!"
He's the chump.
- Thank you.
- Chump.
Thanks.
They're not scared of you.
They don't know who you are.
- They're supposed to be scared?
- Everybody supposed to be scared of you.
- Why?
- Why?
Please!
Big-time gangster like you!
Rich.
- Do you have many rooms?
"- Yeah, we do."
Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.
"I'll think about it, and come back later."
Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.
"Okay, let's go together."
"Yeah, let's."
Hwasung Rest Area
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.
"- Potatoes, large size, please."
"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
"The drunkard has tattled, has he?"
Not him.
Producer Ranbir Kapoor told me his.
"Does he know about it, too?"
Of course.
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.
"In the newspapers, too?"
Yes.
I've sent the news!
You're not an assistant director anymore.
You've been promoted.
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an independent choreographer!
What a cold reaction!
No!
It means the same!
Won't you reward me for the good news I've brought?
What do you want?
Don't you remember?
No!
This won't do!
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?
Yes.
That's how you hurt your own feet!
So let's go...
Okay...
"I mean, I've got to go to the loo!"
But aunty's using it now.
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!
When must I come again?
When I'm not around
-Come on!
-Let's go!
Bring Sandra back to her room first.
Why?
Is there a problem?
I'm pregnant.
I had my check up with Dr. Gamboa.
It's already 7 weeks old.
I'm having such a hard time.
Your husband will come back to you!
So stop crying now.
Stop crying.
"When his memory comes back, who else will he come home to?"
What if his memory doesn't come back?
"Whatever pain was caused by your relationship with Migs, it also has beautiful memories."
"And most of all, stop pleading or begging on that Bela."
Her conscience will haunt her more if you have no connection.
Do you still love Migs?
.
Yes.
I love Migs so much.
You have to wait for him to get better.
"Migs, stop it!"
Come on!
-Why?
I used to do that.
-No.
Oh!
"Wait, I forgot something."
-I'll come back.
-Okay then.
What?
TERRY:
Greg.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CLEARS THROAT)
"What's up, chief?"
"What's up, chief?"
How long have we been mates?
How long have we been mates?
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
Why don't you love me anymore?
Why don't you love me anymore?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
"Look, Terry..."
"Look, Terry..."
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
He says that it is your job to answer the tough questions.
"You owe it to me, to the marriage, to confess everything."
- Pastor Paul...
- This is where we did it.
Can you believe I brought her here?
The same place we were married?
Pastor Paul says we should confess our sins.
Let the confessing begin.
"Make a list, will you, honey?"
Cheated on Clara.
Cheated on Lisa.
Here.
Clara:
Controlling.
Go ahead.
Lisa:
She likes for me to make the decisions.
"Let""s see."
Clara spends too much money.
"Lisa""s broke, but she""s not afraid to ask for help."
She likes for a man to take care of her.
"Lisa is tiny, or petite."
Clara is a big...
- thick person.
- Fat.
You had a great body when we were married.
You just got to work out a little.
Clara has pretty eyes.
"Well, they are."
"They""re beautiful, honey."
They are.
"Lisa, her body""s fit."
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.
- You what?
- Yeah.
- You're not pregnant?
- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.
- I wanna set up a nursery.
- No.
I were gonna call it...
Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I need to be there.
"- Hiya, Moz."
"- All right, Alex?"
How you doing?
Just on me lunch break.
"Thought I'd pop in, get a little bit mashed."
"- You still teaching at secondary school, then?"
"- Yeah, for me sins."
Felix.
"Run,run,run!"
"Go,baby!"
"Go, go, go!"
"Go to second, go to second!"
"Go, baby, go!"
"Go to third, go to third, ziggy!"
"Go, babe!"
"Run, run, run!"
Home run!
Home run!
Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
Sometimes it's just a bit monotonous.
Just a tiny bit dull.
"Hi, Claire."
"Frank, come here."
Have a look.
- Frank!
- Marvelous.
- Look at this.
It's a Torben Din.
- Very nice.
"- 25,000 kroner."
It's a steal.
- It is?
"- Yes, it's worth at least 30-40,000."
- I have to go help out the Gimp.
- He's putting Bodil in a home.
"- Well, good for him."
You just can't eat a thing around a mentally handicapped person.
- He's skin and bone.
- Why can't he eat?
- You can't eat around those people.
- Why not?
It turns you off food when fellow human beings are barmy.
I've never heard that before.
- You haven't?
- No.
- Mia said I was speaking for myself.
- I've never heard anyone think that.
I shagged a handicapped girl once.
I shagged a retard.
- But you can't.
A real retard?
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
"- Come in, have a drink."
"- No, thanks."
I'm in a hurry.
You're always in a hurry!
"- Mrs Keka, a letter for you."
- Thank you.
Put it away.
It'll rain in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Mr. American!
Here it is.
From America.
"Good, good."
Do you save those things for me?
Of course I do.
I'll get to you.
"Tesla, turn it off."
What can I tell you?
He gets scared shitless when he hears this.
Pensions are finally safe!
- It really scared me.
"- Go on, have a drink."
"Tesla, I can understand your inventions, your ideas..."
"I support that, but..."
Can you tell me how many pension robberies we had here?
I've got no idea.
Of course you don't.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go ahead.
Not one!
Not a single robbery!
Who on earth would attack me here and steal the pensions?
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.
Time enough to waste this jerk first.
- Are you retarded or what?
- He touched Martine.
This rat is jinxed!
Here they come!
"I'm warning you, lying is my speciality."
You're not what's lying.
- What is?
- Poverty!
"If one lies, it's to get... one shouldn't ever get!"
"Here, it's okay."
"Jeez, my clog!"
We can't stay here!
- Do you have money?
- No!
"It's full of memories, this place."
I started when I was thirteen.
I never hurt.
I made supermen out of them.
"Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold."
The ice queen doesn't want to die.
To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love...
Same battle.
What are you?
- Hatchet man?
Pocket knife?
- Pardon?
Friend of a friend?
Where did Mickey unearth you?
Is the cadaver in your way?
We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."
He solves...
"Natalie, who does your hair?"
"Oh, God."
"Well, you take your time."
Okay?
"I'll just be over here at the crime scene, if anybody's interested."
Natalie?
"My mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture with me."
Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!
Or suicide.
Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.
"In many ways, this reminds me of the killer astronaut case"
I solved last year.
You probably read about it.
"Hey, Monk?"
Look at this.
Here.
Take this.
You look half frozen.
Thank you.
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
You want a ripe mango?
Come on!
I'm in the mall!
Yes sis.
"Okay, bye!"
How's Joy?
.
Why are you looking for her?
What do you want to hear?
.
That she's okay?
.
And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
I'm going up.
Are you OK on your own while I get you something to wear?
Will you tell Simon I'm here?
Of course.
Got your plastic tits yet?
No.
But I will get some as soon as I'm 18.
"- Hi, Patricia."
- Sofie's here.
She's crying.
She's crying again?
- Sofie.
"Are you OK, baby?"
- I just feel so low.
- Where have you been?
- Sleeping in the park.
- Why didn't you go down to the boat?
- You can't help me.
- Of course I can.
- What's up?
- My mum.
- She'll calm down again.
She's thrown you out.
Tell the bitch I did the right thing.
- It's dead embarrassing for me.
- What the hell is going on?
"Morning, girls."
Is something wrong?
- What's this?
- Check out the centre spread.
"- No, thank you."
- You've got to see it.
I see a light.
- You're not dying.
It's just your ankle.
"Oh, God!"
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me!
- Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
"Throw a rock, honey."
Blunt chest in 2.
"You look wonderful, by the way."
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
"- BP's falling, 70 systolic."
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
"Given there's only one, I don't see how you can."
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.
"He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it."
I need a thoracostomy tray.
"All right, let's see how much air he's got in here."
"Oh, God!"
"That any better, Mr. Chambers?"
Likewise!
"Come on, boy!"
Come on!
Schnapps?
"Well, Sam, here's to your very good health."
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
"You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog."
Yeah?
That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
"- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?"
"- No, no, no, not yet."
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole!
Ha-ha!
How are you?
I got lots trouble.
"Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap."
"What matter, huh?"
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
"Two of my dogs, they die."
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
"Quiet, now!"
Yo!
"That's one fine dog, mister!"
"You want to sell, maybe?"
"- No, I don't."
- I'll say he don't!
"You know, that fellow back there... just offered him 1,000 bucks."
- One thousand bucks?
"- He's like this genius, super secretive."
- Okay.
"And apparently, they're working on this new project."
Big money involved.
Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi."
Um...
Just Cooper.
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine.
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Follow me.
"- Oh, yeah."
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that."
"Okay, great."
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.
She wouldn't wear anything that wasn't perfect.
It doesn't matter anymore.
[ Sobs ]
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Can I-
"- Can I, uh, drive you home or somethin'?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Spooner."
I--
I have to get out of here.
[ Sighs ]
No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
You have to visit.
Your house is large.
That would be ackward.
Maybe ill get a new exam in the university.
"Thats a good idea, good birdwatchers are needed in this country."
Thats for sure.
Its gonna be strange without the war
Yes.
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow.
-How long is it since you have seen them?
Soon four years.
A beer?
"-No, i have to...."
"-You, all the others went into town."
"One beer in the cantine, just the two of us."
Is it a date?
If it helps we can call it that.
-It helps.
-Good.
Cheers!
Thanks
You didnt think you'd get away that easy?
Skinnarland sends his regards.
The sheriff is threatening with exposing them all.
-So you will have your hands full.
Straight back.
One-Two-Three...
"Good,Thanks."
-Einar reports about good weather in the area.
-Good.
-Have a good trip.
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Gentlemen, please go check that shit out."
Freeze!
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but higher-self doesn't.
"Jesus, baby."
She was talking to the man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Dude's got memory lock on.
"Well, that's all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
....
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."
I got it.
"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."
[Spits]
[ Clears Throat ]
"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Hold it.
"Hey, come on."
"We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sakes."
"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?
"It's against your own principle, for God's sake!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hold it!
Hold it!
"If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system."
Director:
"Ok, cut."
That's a wrap.
"I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike."
Take that and drop it by my house.
"Good night, tom."
Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.
"Priests, doctors, lawyers-- I've talked to them all."
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.
[Airplane flies over]
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
So she is in town to kill someone.
And this is the site of her hit.
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm--look, I'm sorry."
I...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm just...
"I got a lot of stuff to do, you know?"
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Catch up with you later?
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay.
Bye.
Are we way off base here?
Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.
I'm sure you have.
I want 'em at least another 15 feet back from the stage.
"Officer, hi."
What's going on here?
Setting up for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Big human rights celebration.
Joseph Dellaman's giving a speech.
The ex-political prisoner?
The rally's here.
He's giving his speech in the square.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
"You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity."
Farewell.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, good riddance, ya loony!"
"""Rendezvous with Star Command."""
"-Hey, gas dude!"
-You talkin' to me?
"-Yeah, man."
Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
"Oh, no!"
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
-Buzz!
"Buzz, come back!"
-Go away!
No!
"Buzz, you gotta come back!"
I...
I found a spaceship!
"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
"Come on, man, hurry up!"
"Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!"
"-Cutting Boulevard, huh?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
Which way?
"Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?"
"And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home."
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.
(Doorbell)
Bill!
"Oh, Bill!"
Honey!
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.
Did you say that to him?
Something like that.
Strong words.

She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"

I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not fine.
You're not cleared.
"You're not fucking training until you are, okay?"
Done.

I have already prepared the documents!
Very good.

I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.

"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."

Just go for it!

- Did you lose your job?
My daddy lost his job.
- Did you get a new job?
"- Yes, giving big shots to little girls."
- Mommy!
- Big shots.
There you go.
- Mrs. Riblet.
Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.
- Smell something?
- Yeah.
"Ma'am, smoking is not permitted in the hospital."
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."
Put that there.
"Why don't we put these away, so that we don't get busted?"

Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late or don't answer a page on the first beep.

It's empty.
Just one bullet.
Hey!
Stop.
Ram.
Gopal.
What's his name?
Verma.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you?
What if he had fired?
If he had fired Bittoo would be dead... and Verma's son would've been hanged.
The same thing... will imply on Boss and Shiv.
I didn't get it.
Boss will kill Shiv... and he'll be foreshadowing crime.
But the Boss workforces.
I don't trust my father.
It's an old rule.
First clear the garbage then clearly record.
Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
- Hanna?
- Her daughter.
Are you her son?
No.
I'm just the guy who opens the door.
"Mr. Leland, this is my daughter Hanna."
- Hello.
"- Hello, Hanna."
"Oh, I forgot to get your signature on this."
Um...
It's just part of authorizing you to look at the safe deposit box.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um...
- I won't be late.
- Okay.
What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.
Some architect from Syracuse.

See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.

What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?

Oh.
Moved before I could.
What a shame.

He's ready.
So are we.
"Gentleman, I don't like your colour."
You look a little green.
What colour would you like?
Suppose you surprise me.

A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.

Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
Thank you.
- Is everything there?
- Yes.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"- Yes, but I'm going home."
"- Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
- Do you like dancing?
- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
- Silent cinema?
- Yes.
- What do you do when you go out?
- I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.

I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
Thanks for the wallet.
Temperature suddenly dropping with no explanation.
Thought that you were a man of science.
I am.
But I also know that there are things in life that even science can't explain.
Okay.
Carter.
Any messages for me?
"Uh, no, Ms. Marquez, no messages."
There's nothing from Mr. Harpel?
Nothing.
Danny here?
Do you see him?
What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.
[Sighs]
One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.

Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."

And it doesn't have to be neat.
Have some coffee.
It'll wake you up.

What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
do you?
That's very annoying.
but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
To have my picture in the papers...
Be the first in Rome...
"Damn it, Malaparte, take me to Capri."
You're laughing at me!
"I can't believe it, you're laughing at me!"
"No, no, I'm laughing at myself."
It's incredible.
"The destruction, hunger, violence..."
All that for a photo in the papers.
You ignorant son of a bitch!
"I hate your attitude, you latin snob!"
Know-it-all!
All of you!
Back!
Pervert!
Pig!
Dirty gigolos!
"Imbecile, imbecile!"
And you're laughing at me?
"You can stick your flag right between your legs, in your ass!"
One catastrophe after another.
"Get out, get out!"
It's unbelievable!
What a disgrace.
"Listen, if you take me to the airport, I'll pay."
Stop!
Stop!
I'll give you US$50 to take me to the airport.
Get in.
What's happening?
What's this?
The Vesuvius.
You won't?
You really won't do as I say?
Director Kim.
Director Kim!
Director Kim!
"Director Kim, get back here, right now!"
"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.
The law is right.
Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?
Law is dead.
But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.
"Come on, look."
"I'll give you $10,000, you can do as you want."
"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?
(Laughing)
"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.
"You were an accountant, that right?"
"Me, accountant?"
"Can't make a good living these days, don't you agree?"
One thing.
"Was your name Lun Taichen, and did you know Cheng Tachwan?"
Cheng Tachwan?
Cheng Tachwan?
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark.
Be gone.
- Wait!
- Come back here!
"Sir Knight, come back, please!"
Griselda.
Mr. Fishfinger.
I've got to go.
Sorry about your hand.
It hurts!
I've missed you.
I've kept your potato.
Bye!
You really are a big disappointment to me.
I thought you were gonna make something of yourself.
He is the king's champion!
You're my partners.
You're holding so many options on land you could buy Brooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
- What's that?
- My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I going to do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
- Take care.
- All right.
That's for the dead cop.
Reverend Chapman will introduce me?
With one sentence.
And then what?
Get out of here.
- And which way is that?
- Side door.
No.
He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.
Hey!
Drop it!
Help me!
"- Let her go, Jordan."
- Stand back!
You got no where to go.
Drop the scissors.
"Listen, fellas, I'm a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders, oh, it's just so unsatisfying!"
That's why they always go out in style.
"Just relax, Jordan."
Don't do anything stupid.
Stupid?
Me?
How can you say that when we've outsmarted you for years?
"Who's ""we""?"
Who's your partner in L.A.?
A genius.
He believed in me.
"Took my visions, made them real."
"Give us a name, Jordan."
You'll never find him.
Ah!
[Gunshots fire]
[Sobbing]
Okay.
"No, I understand."
Thank you.
Hey. [Door closes]
That was Ryan and Esposito.
They had to kill Jordan Keegan.
But they sent us digital copies of Jordan's computer.
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
Where are you going?
I don't know yet.
Can I come?
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.
"Well, we got to do what's in the photo."
"Right, bro?"
Where we going?
Nowhere.
I don't want to abandon Jasper in case something goes wrong.
Are we okay?
I got jealous.
This is a- it's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.
"And I, obviously, am- I'm not handling it well."
(SIGHS)
You got jealous?
(EXHALES)
Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
I want her to be able to learn
- how to solve problems on her own.
- Yeah.
"I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever."
Thanks or whatever.
He dumped me.
- What?
- What?
W-What'd he do that for?
He said I was suffocating him.
I can't believe you guys made me talk to my boyfriend.
You ruined my life!
And mine!
SAMANTHA:
God!
- JEN:
Um...
- JENNA:
Let's get piercings.
Do you understand anything that just happened?
Yeah.
Teenagers are crazy.
"I mean, I think we got it wrong."
"Like, babies are not the hard part."
That is the hard part.
But we'll get through it.
- Yeah. (sighs)
- Mm-hmm.
We just gotta put our thinking caps on.
"Okay, just get the hat, Greg."
"Oh, yeah."
They still got it!
- We don't know yet.
"I'm so sorry, Nick."
You think you can figure out what this is?
I'm going to do my best.
"First, I have to test the cat's claws, but if I can't get it from the cat,"
I'm going to have to go see Juliette.
"Okay, are you good here for now?"
- Not really.
- Yes.
"Hey, where you going?"
I'm going to find Adalind.
[Cat yowling]
[Cage rattles]
[Cat yowls]
Maybe it just doesn't like me.
Blutbaden and house pets don't really mix.
"Except, you know, as the occasional between-meal treat."
I'm going to start with some valeriana officinalis.
[Cat hisses]
[Cat screeches] All right.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps approach]
"No, no, no."
Don't shoot.
"Hey, come on."
Put it down.
Who were you shooting at?
Adalind!
Adalind!
[Cell phone ringing]
Yeah?
"He was here at my house, Nick."
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.
We've got to track Zana.
-Sensato.
We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.
VG
-Tangen is out there.
-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?

"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."
"camels used to bring the mail, the directorwas a Bedouin."
- Are you making fun of me?
- No...
- Mattia!
- How's it goin'?
This guy?
Looks like the michelin man.
He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."
- I get it.
- What?
He always gets things late.
- Buy you a coffee?
"- No, I have to work."
"Wait, Iet me introduce two stalwart co-workers."

- Wait!
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?
"Fine, I'll get it... again."
- What do you want me to do first?

Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.

Sure.
"Come on, kids."
This way.

There's not enough water in the warmer.
- Thanks.

Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
"- Okay, infuser's on."
- Looks good.
"Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume?"
"Shit Livingstone, asshole?"
Your finger's on the pulse.
Mickey the Arab wants a word with you.
I'm very expensive.
"- Playing for keeps, or you got the creeps?"
- Don't you worry.
We're in a pest controlled area.
What's on Mickey's agenda?
Disneyland!
- That's gonna be tough.
"- No, a straight split."
"Tomorrow, midnight, where you want, ladies as witnesses, face to face, all holds barred."
It's high time.
"You shit flies, keep buzzing around Mickey."
"If he ever comes out of the Casbah, he'll regret his mad wanking."
"He's not mad, he's here!"
Skedaddle!
Oh my!
Oh my!
Your what?
Do you have an aspirin?
Your lovely brothers.
"Simon and Edgar, for instance."
out of your league.
Forget it.
Edgar. 5 am.
Blow deal.
Rue Lenine.
In Charenteuil.
That's our turf.
Sure you've got no aspirin?
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."
What do you want?
-To where you go?
They see here.
We speak.
It vetoes the devil.
You have what you deserve.
She can't be.
She never goes out.
KNOCKING
Hiya!
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
"It's Melissa, isn't it?"
Yeah.
I'm Peggy.
This is Elaine.
I know.
OK if we come in for a sec?
"Yeah, sure."
You have the most incredible skin!
Have people told you that before?
Not really.
So pretty it glows.
Let's open that other bottle.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
The drawer nearest the fridge.
"(If you don't want to do it, just say no.)"
CORK POPS
"Did I mention, this woman is a genius with a lens?"
PEGGY CHUCKLES
"She will make you look better than you have ever looked,"
I guarantee it.
"And if she can't, hell, everything we do is airbrushed, anyway."
I don't think...
I don't really...
We have a deadline.
And there's literally no-one else we can ask.
As a neighbour?
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
- It's at Jay-Mo's Diner.

[Coughing]
[Siren continues wailing]

- There isn't time.
"All units, 565 East Jefferson."
"I repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
This is Lieutenant Al Garner requesting available fire and EMS units.
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.
"- Repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
- [Coughing]
[Man] BP's 84 over 36.
[Garner] The owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
- He's in and out of consciousness.
- [Labored breathing]
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
Did Kaman Scott do this to you?
We have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
Do you know this girl?
Tracy.
Tracy.
Don't let him...
- Please stop him.
- Is Tracy nearby?
"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
Split!
Where to?
Come here!
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!
"Bravo, aunt!"
That was wonderful!
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?
"Always remember her, before you touch another woman."
You can even remember me.
"Sure, Mom!"
"Call me ""aunt""...not Mom!"
"You were great, young lady!"
"Thank you, Laxmi."
What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?
The joke.
"Yes, sir, that is correct, sir."
- We are on full lockdown.
- Hey!
We need help up here now!
Security sweep!
Open up!
Thirty seconds.
Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.
Armoury secure.
"All right, let's go."
"Let's move, move!"
- Hold up.
We're on full lockdown here.
- Hey!
East Hall secure.
Heading for Castle Sky.
You've reached the voice mail of Emily Cale.
Why aren't you texting me?
"Em, as soon as you get this, call me back."
"- Keep moving, keep moving!"
"- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol."
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?
I have Eagle.
"Call WFO, get as many men as you can to the Capitol."
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.
A hard perimeter around Castle.
Eastside Gate.
"Come on, let's go, people."
"Fred, open the gate."
Gossip girl might be right about me
But she's--she's wrong about you.
Without serena van der woodsen
Who would i have dreamt about?
I might have spent my whole life on the outside
If you hadn't let me in...
Which i'm holding against you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
Wait. they're a team.
Team of what?
Wait.
Why are you all here?
I got a text saying to meet you.
- Yeah
- So did I.
- So did I.
You wanted to meet gossip girl.
Well look around.
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high school friendships fade
It's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
now that all my secrets are out
You have a clean slate...
Until college.
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you. oh.
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.
"J. D. , come on !"
"Go call an ambulance, man."
Go call a fucking ambulance!
I told him not to move.
Hurry up!
SANTANA:
Thought I knew it all.
Ended up in juvie hall.
And the shit got even deeper.
COP:
To the right.
Open up your mouth.
"Okay, pick your clothes up."
Take it on down to the property room to exchange your clothing.
"(whispering) Don't fucking move, you fuck!"
Don't make a fucking sound.
Hear me?
(groaning)
(GRUNTlNG)
Does it feel good?
"Fuck, yeah."
"You say one word about this,"
"(panting) there'll be shit on my knife, not on my dick!"
Fucker.
(GRUNTS)
"Damn you, you fucking asshole!"
Kill him !
Kill him.
(groaning)
SANTANA:
killing that first night got me the worst that juvie had to offer.
An extended sentence with a guaranteed bus ride to the big time as soon as I turned 1 8.
"No, quite the reverse."
Knock-out drops.
Surely you've heard of them?
- For knocking out what?
- People.
Who else?
- You mean a sleeping draught.
"- I suppose so, but instantaneous."
"My dear madam, you're asking for a Mickey Finn."
- Am I?
"- We have a mild soporific here, if you're sleeping badly."
"I'm sleeping perfectly well, thank you."
Mickey Finn...
Mickey...
Thank you very much.
"Desiree, you are the expert on crime, how would one obtain a Mickey Finn?"
"Well, I get all dope on drugs from a little crook called Maury Fish."
He hangs around in a pub called the Limehouse Arms.
The Limehouse Arms?
Thank you very much.
(Piano music and chatter)
- Yes?
- Gin and...
"Port and lemon, please."
- Thank you.
- One and six.
- You know Maury Fish?
- Why?
I want some Mickey Finns.
"The real McCoy, mac."
- What for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
It isn't that I...
Thank you.
Lin?
You're a brave woman.
"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.
- Choppers are coming up the valley.
- Where's Doc?
"Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right."
Let's get the colonel.
MULDOON:
LZ is a meadow just over that rise.
Let's move out!
MULDOON:
Petersen!
Bastards!
Move out.
Move out.
"You heard him, let's go!"
BECKWORTH:
What area's designated as offloading ramp today?
M. P:
"Last pad over, next to the water."
- See that runway over by the beach?
- Yeah?
That's where your Peter-san's going to be coming in.
You take care of yourself.
Thank you.
"- Mister, you Beckworth?"
- That's right.
"If you want to go where the war is, this is the way."
"Yeah, here, want this?"
That should clear up the infection in about 24 hours.
"However, the world might look a little fuzzy to you for a while."
"Here, put these on, Paula."
It'll cut down the glare.
(JUDY SCREECHES)
Judy.
Take that-- that's my new hat.
For Pete's sake.
"Around here, all hats belong to people."
"But if you find one in the bush, keep it."
(CHATTERING)
- And where're you going?
"- Well, to make lunch."
"Lunch has already been prepared, courtesy of Jack, our new short-order cook."
"Well then, I better check on it."
I wonder how many ways you can boil eggs.
Chief cook and bottle washer.
"Boy, what a waste of talent."
Hmm.
(CHATTERING)
(CHATTERING CONTINUES)
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, for crying out loud."
Judy!
(SIGHS)
"Ok, Toto, enjoy the peel."
"Look, for once, please try to be a good girl, huh?"
Just today?

(ROARS)
(CHATTERING)
- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
I know it!
I know now!
You have done this!
You have done this!
I know it!
"Dhanraj,just think that God has punished you for your misdeeds!"
"Your bad time has arrived, Dhanraj!"
Your mill has caught fire and there..
..you have sold offSwarg to bag 90 lakh!
I didnt get you.
Just think that if you dont have that 90 lakh then?
Hey!
This cant be!
This will never happen!
There is saying in every language and Gujrati too!
God is a silent punisher!
No!
Greetings!
Greetings!

Greetings!
"Greetings, Mr. Adda!"
Wow!
Add one goldfish.
"Oh, no!"
"For him, time has stopped."
Is it dead?
No.
Watch carefully.
"Now, he's in the future."
He leapt through the time he was frozen.
"No, that's not right."
"On TV, time machines go zoom..."
"Yeah, up and back between past and present."
Correct.
And that's what I'm studying.
"Follow me, please."
I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?
What if he kidnaps us?
You've got your cell phone.
No service.
Isn't he a weirdo?
That's only what my Dad said.
"Come on, come on, come on."
D'ARTAGNAN:
"Yes, yes, yes."
PORTHOS:
"Good, good."
What we got?
What we got?
What we got?
"- Oh, you beauty."

Lovely work.

Flush them out.
Use the gunpowder.
(MAN SHOUTING ORDERS)
(VENDORS SHOUTING)
ANNE:
Why else would Louis choose Aramis particularly to be his personal guard?
He knows.
CONSTANCE:
You don't know that for sure.
The King has hated me for five years.
I know things have been difficult between you but...
Our marriage has been for public show.
"In private, he's ignored or slighted me at every turn."
You need to stay strong.
You're still the Queen of France.
Perhaps not for long.
Do you think that the King would want a scandal that could endanger the throne?
"The Dauphin is his son, the King could never admit to anything else."
I had hoped that everything with Aramis was over.
Forgotten.
People page.
Names...
"Karl W. Taylor, Eric Sawyer."
- Page thirty-three.
- Society world.
It's a photo of a couple that just got married.
Centerfold.
What does she do?
"She's an actress, a model... a dancer, and a dental technician."
She enjoys cooking and hip-hop.
"She's wearing a black bikini, and she's fine."
Yes!
What's her measurements?
Thirty-eight...
"After you touch it, it only lasts for thirty seconds."
You really got superpowers!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
"- Man, this is wild."
- Check this out.
"Jeff, you were hit by a meteor."
Think anybody else got superpowers?
Larry?
"Larry, come in here."
Something's wrong with this TV.
"What's wrong, Mary?"
The channels keep changing by themselves.
They keep what?
Fix it.
It's this thing.
It's this right here.
"Oh, see, I know what's wrong."
I know what's wrong.
- Yeah.
You do?
What should we do now?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"Oh, yeah."
Memory serves.
"Now that I have your attention, listen up."
"You do not come into my town, threaten people I care about."
Going after Elena?
Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.
Because I do believe in killing the messenger.
You know why?
Because it sends a message.
[GASPS AND GRUNTS]
"If Katherine wants something from me, you tell that bitch to come get it herself."
[KNOCKS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
"You were obviously upset about something, and I just walked away."
That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.

I know.

"It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked."

"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."
"You have entered the university that you want,"
I have entered the military academy.

I don't really like movie.
You don't?
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?
Fine.
Fine.
We're out of bullets again tho.
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?
They seem to have plenty.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
These guys got everything Daze!
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?
It's like Christmas!
I got you...
Sucker!
Take your pick mister.
Why don't you decide?
"Okay, let's see..."
"I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze."
"Alright, are you ready mister?"
Sure.
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.
Hardy har har.
What?
Are you done yet?
Come again?
"I said ""Are you done yet?"""
What are you talking about?
"You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you?"
I most certainly was.
With that piece?
"- Ok, ok."
"- They make a good team, you know."
"Jin-san, I wonder if even now you are being discharged, you want to stay."
"Hold on, Captain."
Before when we were running under the bombing... you know I could have done it alone.
Don't you?
But... we are trained to don't let no one behind.
Fool!
Nobody is going to praise you...
""" Thank you "" you should say..."
Male here.
I found the main point.
It was true... there's a special warhead...
Male here.
Entered inside the TL.
Good.
"Start the access, I'll go as soon as possible."
Yankee.
Can you immediately put together a log?
Yankee?
What's going on?
Yankee?
"Gimlet here, over!"
"Male, reply!"
Gimlet here.

Can't contact Yankee.
I'll send a scout team to the surface to investigate.
To the surface?
Hey!

Didn't earn your points yet?
That hasn't changed.
You don't lose a steady hand.
"Except, back then it was control."
Now it's rheumatism.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the oldest part of Amsterdam."
We're driving past the oldest buildings.
We're now going to sex theatre Casa Rosso.
We wish you a very good time.
Can we help?
"-That's nice of you, thank you."
I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wonderbar!"
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
The mailman put one of your letters... in my box.
I'll give you some medication.
I'm growing a mustache.
Miss Brody.
It's me.
It's Detective Ridgely.
"You all right, honey?"
Take this.
Miss Brody.
Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again.
You understand?
It's all right.
"Hey, Barry."
"Long night, squire?"
Hospital bills.
You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois?
If you'll just be patient...
Thank you.
But this says 3B.
Yes.
Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B.
Somebody made a mistake.
That's right.
Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B.
Who has access to these files?
Only hospital personnel.
I want a list.
All right.
Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this?
This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing.
What were you doing at the El station... so late at night?
Why do you want to know?
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.
Who's saying that?
I don't know.
People. I mean.
"She told me the truth, of course."
What truth?
How far you guys went.
Well.
Yeah.
Because nothing happened.
"Right, so how come it's all over school?"
"I mean, you're not talking it up like some low-life..."
"derelict cretin telling everyone you did her, are you?"
J ust checking.
- H i Brian.
- H i.
- This is Gina.
- Hey.
- Right.
H i.
- Brian saw the entire thing.
I heard you actually chased the gunmen.
- Chased the gunmen?
- l would have screamed.
I have to leave the room when my father uses the electric knife.
"I think chase is a little bit strong, but I was going to check out the situation ..."
because you know if there's a gun--
!
- Are you starting again?
!
"Why is Kobi screaming, honey?"
"Then who is that, Yitzhak?"
"Why are you crying, Yarivi?"
Your father called me.
He said he might want to come too.
Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-.
"It's all kosher, dear."
"Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister."
"She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook!"
"So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa?"
What can I do?
I teach Hebrew.
"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?
- Are you better?
- What do you mean?
He's asking if you're better.
You said you were sick.
"- Me, sick?"
- Aren't you sick?
I'm as healthy as a horse.
This is in Paris.
"You came to visit, remember?"
Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?
- Do you remember?
- How?
I was only five.
Then how should I remember?
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
Howdy folks.
Who are you?
Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Matira?
No.
Over the mountains then?
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
"Take it, you don't get many strangers around here?"
No.
Especially not those who travel near dark.
Why's that?
- You really don't know?
- Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.
"It's been three months, how much longer do you think it will wait."
"Hi, what are you talking about?"
The Daemus.
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."

Hello.

- Marco Zuloaga.
This is Alicia.
- Was it your first night here?
- Yes.
The first is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
What are those boots for?
They stop her feet from twisting sideways or falling forward.
- They look like Ibizan boots.
- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."
- I never check up on me boarders.
- Your daughter's checking on him.
Right.
Right.

"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
"Alright, see ya."
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.
"We tried calling you, but the armada must have knocked out all communications."
[grunting] [both] Huh?
Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."
"Hey, let me get two more."
And one for my buddy.
"Oh, man, you remember this?"
How could I forget it?
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.

Yeah.
"Hey, you wanna get your sidekick under control?"
"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."
Robbie!
Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?
"Yeah, I got it."
Bi Boo!
What are you doing?
Can't you speak clearly?
You have to say each word clearly.

I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."

Who is she?
Electrocuted.
She was electrocuted in the bathtub.
I know.
I saw.
But how did the curling iron fall into the tub?
There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.
"When I saw her, I thought she was healthy."
Saw who?
Who was in there?
"- What, you got bumped?"
- No.
"Mm, they, uh, found a girl with better hobbies."
Would you quit?
No.
I decided not to be on that list.
Because...
"Well, just because."
Don't feel like you have to cancel your blind date.
I'm not going on that date.
"- Oh, what, she blew you off?"
- No.
Right.
"She saw your picture, huh?"
I just didn't feel like going out tonight.
With her.
Great.

Yeah I'd like that.
"All right, this is perfect."

Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.

Nothing.

"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?

You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.

"All I'm saying is, he'll have his cock right deep in her gob and then in her vag."
"Out the vag, back in the gob."
Thanks!

Give that to your mum for us.
Are you serious?
"- Oh, you are."
- Don't tell her who it's from.
"No, course not."
"Anything else, Neil?"

- Would you?
Let me think.
Would I?
No.
"No, I fucking wouldn't."

Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.
I enjoy her company.

She's off to China soon.

Which will take precedence?

I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."

I'm suggesting exclusive rights to it all.
"I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
"No, I'm not going to sell them individually."

"Yes, the world."

Very shy.
- Are you okay?
- I'll be there.
Go on.
"Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick."
"Best to the sister, yeah?"
Be well.
"You know, Isabel,"
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.
"Dr. Cairn says that your progression has been remarkable, so not to worry."

You don't need his approval.
You understand?
- Yes.

I will slap in your face in the way you have not seen it before.
That's it.
Bashirou!
What a nice shirt.
It looks great on you.
"If I wear gunny, you know what's gunny?"
If I wear gunny it will looks good on me.
Now I bought something for you that it looks so great on you.
It goes with you so much.
Thank you.
Bashirou!
You've forgot it again.
- Where are you going with such clothes?
- Tangak_
You won't go to Tangak_ I will.
I said you can't go to Tangak_
"How great you are going there,lf not you had made me disappointed."
"Go to stay with your father, wretched slatteml"
Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Mister!
Hey Mister!
Stop your car!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey!
Stop!
Hey!
Next up there...
Carlos.
They will be the local authorities.
Good morning gentlemen.
We came from the Balkans.
This is the king of Belgium.
We are a diplomatic mission.
Excuse me?
He is Albanian.
She does not speak Italian?
We are in Albania.
How 'in Albania'?
"Oh, I do not believe it."
Are you sure?
- Yup.
Let's go down and ask for a phone.
"Carlos, what happened?"
- They'll be the currents.
How 'the currents'?
- There are so many currents at sea.
Well then we go down.
We went to Montenegro.
There we bought a boat there.
We were to get to the sea.
"No, excuse me, in Italy."
The captain of the Albanian port was not impressed.
He smoked a lot
While Ludovic tried to explain the situation.
But nothing to do.
"For him, we were just the sociable."
- Can I have a glass of water?
Please...
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
Yan-ling was killed by the Wu-tang.
Which one of you killed her?
- We didn't kill your sister.
- Liar!
Your sister was killed by someone else.
"Trust me, we're friends!"
I ain't your friend!
I'm your enemy!
Yes!
Use full strength!
Stop talking!
Fight!
Go!
"Ming-kai, use 8-divine Sword."
"Wu-tang, why didn't you use full force?"
How did you know?
Go on!
Why did you intentionally miss him?
How did you know I missed him?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Yes!
You better not play any tricks!
We won't.
"It's just a contest, so there's no need to kill each other."
Nonsense!
What do you mean?
Mean?
Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine sword are both impressive.
I can't distinguish which is better.
That's why I invited you both here.
I want to know which is better.
FINN:
Maybe.
Or-
Or what?
The camera took a picture ahead of time?
(SCOFFS) Give me a break.
"I mean, just look at it."
"The placement of everything, my canvass."
Your canvass has looked like that for months.
"(WHIRRING) Uh, hey, guys."
"(CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRRINGS)"
(BULB POPS)
(WINDS DOWN)
No way.
WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
This was last Wednesday.
Remember you broke the mug with your four-iron?
"Oh, yeah, right."
Thursday.
Friday we went to the movies.
"Saturday we lost power, used candles."
Sunday.
Monday.
"That's tonight, Tuesday."
Tomorrow.
Bullshit.
"Mr. ""B"" invented a camera that takes pictures of the future, and he only used it to look in our apartment?"
Doesn't make any sense.
"Well, maybe he's testing it."
"Yeah, and this thing isn't exactly portable."
"Well, he's a scientist, so there's got to be some sort of logs or documentation somewhere."
You're supposed to be on lookout?
What's goin' on?
We're trying to find a way out.
"But everything's locked from the outside, and these locks,"
I just never seen anything like them.
"The walls are concrete, and I was telling the guys"
I think the windows are palladium-
- Palladium plated.
"Actually, that means you can't break the windows."
We're just double checking.
"I know what it means, Connor."
"Don't fucking start with me, man."
All right?
I've got this under control.
What about calling out?
Nothing works.
"Cell phones, walkie, everything's, there's no signal."
"This is really fuckin' bad, man."
"Ah, Goddamn, I think I broke my ass."
You got a gun?
Yeah.
- Well let's use it.
- What?
Get out of the way.
"- No, no no."
- Get out of the way.
"Ah fuck, Riley."
"Shit, what are you..."
"Ah, stop."
- Shit.
Just stop.
Look.
not a clairvoyant.
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.
Go inside now!
asshole.
This is private property.
it is.
I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai.
Where are you keeping the old man?
Hmm?
Is he over there?
Or is he there?
That'd be smart.
I'd like to meet him.
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.
what happened back east.
He's been dead for a year.
I need the girl.
What girl?
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
There's no girl here.
I know you went to the motel.
I was called there.
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.
Just the woman.
Such as she was.
you saw Gabriela.
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.
did you?
did you?
I asked you first.
Please leave.
If nothing had happened... there is no need for you to get furious.
Manoj!
Manoj!
"Manoj, open the door!"
Open the door!
Hello!
Where are you going?
You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.
I'll tell what I have to tell at the police station.
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
"Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one."
"I might lose that even identity now, because of you!"
"Keep going, Panju."
Will you drive recklessly just because you are cop?
Can't you be careful?
Where is your helmet?
"Let's go, Panju."
"Sorry, man."
Idiot.
He went inside!
How do I always find one like this!
Hey!
Inspector Arivazhagan?
- l will take you to Bombay.
"- No, no!"
Brother...
"Unless I don't work hard, I won't get the fruits."
Fruits?
I can see the fruits that you've got.
And about that back-breaking drill that you spoke of what is that?
- That was about parades!
- l see...
So you call it parade.
And what do you do?
- Love!
- Love?
"That's only part-time, brother."
"Otherwise, she studies too!"
I can read you too!
Your height is 6 feet 2 inches.
Your chest is 42 inches.
You like light-brown clothes.
You have an import-export business.
And you don't know swimming...
"Enough of it, Pooja."
"No, Pooja...don't!"
"Brother, whose car is this?"
It cannot belong to you.
- lt belongs to a lovely friend.
- A lovely friend?
Or a girlfriend?
A lovely friend!
- You?
- l didn't see you here before.
I have opened this shop recently.
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?
This fabric isn't so fire resistant.
They're my family.
My blood.
We have to practice thoroughly before the performance.
One tiny mistake leads to a break in the neck and...
She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?
What can I do to help you?
"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
"Please, do not do it"
"What are you waiting for, Mike?"
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
You coward.
"Good job, Mike."
"Now, I've been national i.ne."
Are you to be lachrymose?
!
"Okay, guys."
Collect them all.
Statues take him from here.
Come on!
Let's go!
I endorse this community.
Right there on the altar of a building.
"- I think the larger church take care of There are issues, Father."
- Right said.
One need not listen to confess.
- Hello Ms. Erin.
"- Good day, Father, Do you want to listen to a confession?"
- I listened to you last night itirafınızı.
- Listened to?
"- Yes, I listened."
- This is great.
Would you listen to it again?
- Of course.
- I was thinking about heaven that different layers.
- Yes?
Maybe my husband to a lower floor.
"I have another on the floor, if I can not be together."
- I think it is not a sin.
It trusts me.
But you're going to put it in a cage.
It's cold.
It knows it'll get some crumbs in a cage.
Thought wild things liked their freedom
"Freedom to starve is no freedom, sir."
"Is that why you joined the British army, Harper?"
Maybe
Can't be easy to be Irish.
Wearing the uniform of England
"No harder than it is for yourself, sir, having to walk into the officers' mess wearing the uniform of a gentleman."
"You fight dirty, Harper."
"So do you, sir."
Morning Miss Teresa
Good morning.
"Morning, Lieutenant."
"Morning, Miss."
Hope you slept well.
I slept safely.
Thank you.
"Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir."
Do you smell danger?
I smell French cavalry.
Horse sweat and saddle rot.
- They were here.
- Nonsense.
Casa Antigua is ahead.
"My own people, they would have warned us"
Smoke.
Village on fire!
- My village.
Vamos!
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
"Madame George Sand, dear."
The authoress.
(coughing)
(horse neighs)
- Are you ready now to face me?
"- God, MaIIefiIIe!"
Not now!
"Yes, now."
No kisses?
Where's my greeting?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, MaIIefiIIe."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
- I'm open.
- Come on.
Move it around.
- Watch out.
Watch out.
- Hit my blocker.
Hit my blocker.
Can't feel it.
"Okay, put some mustard on this one."
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, man, keep it going."
"Let's do it, man."
Ten bucks for the first one who gets one past my glove.
L'll make it 50.
"Put that puck in the net, or we'll be here all night."
I am not pleased.
Cross!
Cross!
"Move, move!"
"Nice save, my darling."
Come in.
"Mr Mayor, thanks for driving over."
Never miss a practise.
Have you heard?
Newman failed a surprise inspection today.
This report should sway public opinion and clear the way for my purchase of the land.
What about the boys?
"Well, I love kids just as much as anyone, but..."
Excuse me.
"Do I need to install tampon dispensers in the locker room, ladies?"
Hit someone.
But there are...
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Slowly forward.
Two steps.
- Look to the side.
- Like this?
"No, left side to the camera, your good side, and now raising your eyes and turning as the Stuka..."
"Please, if you don't mind..."
Stuka.
- Johnnie is hit!
Can you bring the light over here?
Thank you.
"Could you move, please?"
We're trying to get big boy up there.
- Sorry.
- Tea.
Excuse me.
- Coming through.
- Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I thought that was really rather convincing,"
- don't you think?
- Very real.
"Oh, I say, are those rock cakes?"
Ooh!
They want to know when it'll be ready.
It's very much on its way.
"Only you keep saying that you'll be sending over the new ending, but..."
- It's almost ready.
- Oh.
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
It's the same shirt.
That was Haskell DeBray.
He was already dead.
Who was?
Don't let Serena out of your sight.
Hey.
Look up.
- What?
- Look up.
What are you doing here?
Brother wasn't the shooter.
That was a decoy.
The brother was somewhere else.
It's worse than that.
DeBray was killed five days before
"Serena disappeared the first time, in a hitandrun."
I saw the footage.
"It was him, Nico."
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
The real killer is still out there.
It's not over.
"You can just get into traffic cameras, just like that?"
- Public access to public security.
- Mmhmm.
That was the guy we're tracking?
"- Yeah, backwards, from the police station."
- Okay.
Shooting happened a couple minutes before 12:00.
Go for something on...
Broadway and Van Ness.
Hey.
"Mimi's vitals are Aokay, getting Aokay'er."
What now?
We chase them.
Chase them?
(GROWLING)
"Maintain our course to the south, the Philippines."
"Well, Tara... it took some getting used to, but this ""being a mom"" gig ain't naif bad."
I've waited a long time for this.
The time has come for us to return to our master.

I feel something.
Carol!

School...
"It's challenging, demanding, and takes a whole lot of work,"
"And it can be hard on your kids, too."
"Jeez, Brick, what do you got in here?"
This thing weighs a ton.
"Well, I told you, there's been a measurable increase"
In workload now that I'm in third grade.
It's really cutting into my reading time.
Okay.
Chicken nuggets...
Piles of popsicle sticks...
Oh!
An ant farm.
"Oh, sorry."
Ant cemetery.
Long long time ago ...
Very distant land ...

To the benefit of that touching?
"- Good morning, John."
- Good morning.
- Do you have a swing?
- Yes.
John?
Do you have a family?
My father does not.
My mother in heaven.
"Sorry to hear that, Angel."
- I'm hungry.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Come on, what there was in the closet."
"- Does not look good, John."
I spoke with Children's Services.
When you want said they could bring.
Oh ...
OK.
Sandman.
Golden age.
***
- Nice.
- Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh,why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one,please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"- Hey,did you see psycho there?"
"- Oh,yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.I have every issue of sandman.
"Mint condition.You know,if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh,I am.It's just,well,I also kind of have,like,a day job."
"- Thanks,Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
Grace.
""" Where are the bombs,Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended,Doctor,by all means,wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
My horse!
Why did you let the general escape?
"Go, look for him!"
"Don't move, your Highness."
It's me.
Henry from Bavorov.
"Oh, dear God."
Thank you.
"If we survive, I'll fulfil your every wish."
"Come, your Highness, down to the water."
"Bring back the general, dead or alive!"
"Too late, soldier."
"No, just a few more steps!"
Get to the water!
We must cross that mountain.
- It's a precipice!
"- Jump, don't be afraid."
Now he's trapped!
We'll drown!
"Please jump, your Highness!"
Now!
The devil took them.
"Look, aren't they beautiful?"
!
The finest in the world!
You can't eat toadstools.
Show me what you picked.
"All these, look, all beautiful..."
The red ones are poisonous!
Pick only the boletus!
So they're all ugly and poisonous and that's a red one too.
"No, that's an orange-cap, a good one."
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
"Right again, Mr. Monk."
An electromagnet.
Battery operated.
Strong enough to pull these six balls and only these balls up the chute.
"Well, we didn't put that there."
"Oh, Miss Teeger, please."
Don't insult us.
You started working here two weeks ago.
You had access to the equipment.
"Suddenly, your friend wins what?"
$106 million.
I suggest you both get good lawyers.
What?
This is nuts.
"Hey, Monk?"
Monk?
Have you got anything?
There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?
The truck driver?
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement.
I'm sure he did.
Waiter!
Yo!
There's something wrong with my glass.
It's empty.
You know what?
Hell.
Just bring the whole bottle and charge it to the room.
"I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy."
"Uh, okay, sure."
Why not?
"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Hi.
There's no need to interact with me.
I'm just here to observe.
What's he observing?
We're scientists.
We observe everything.
"Here, go buy yourself a scone."
All right.
- And what is your name?
- Angela.
"Oh, derived from the word ""angel."" Appropriate."
You're cute.
I'd like to buy a scone.
"Oh, I'm sorry, we're out."
We have muffins.
"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, just getting comfortable."
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
I...
They were out of scones.
"Sheldon, I'm talking to someone."
You're being rude.
I'll bet you're an actress.
"If not, you should be."
You have a very expressive face.
"Oh, my God."
"Wait, where are you going?"
Why did you go there?
Don't you get a newspaper at home?
You are changing the topic again.
You can try.
You cannot avoid me.
- Why did you go there?
- Shiv!
What's wrong...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
I am getting married.
Okay?
And he's just the type of guy I want.
"Intense, charming.."
Silent.
Silent in bed as well?
Stop your nonsense and leave!
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?
He's just your type?
He's charming?
What were you doing with me?
What were you doing with me?
"Tell me, what were you doing with me then!"
Tell me something.
Listen... please.
I won't do anything.
Listen to me.
I understand that economics is important.
"I am a banker, I understand."
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?
It isn't hard to find.
Is it true what the newspapers say?
That you never drive a car?
I never have to.
I was thinking of helping you... with communcations.
"Well, that should be fine..."
Now to test it.
Want to come with me?
"Yes, with pleasure, but what was the problem?"
Nearly nothing at all.
"Just old, I think."
The damned motor was stuck together with wire when I got here...
But it's been fixed.
I hope so.
"Enough, enough!"
Did General Cork send you to be my latin lover?
Enough!
- Confess.
"- Yes, yes, enough!"
"Forgive me, I was cruel, forgive me..."
Everyone is cruel sometimes.
"Hey kid, come here."
Let's go have some fun.
"Two, two!"
Careful.
"Yes, five dollars."
"You're disgusting, stay away from me!"
You depraved animal!
"Cretin, pervert!"
How can they do it?
"My god, how can they sell their own children?"
They're hungry.
- Mr. Charles.
- Charles: goodbye.
We've got to do something about your...
- Your issue.
- Your narcolepsy.
What?
- You're going running again?
- yeah.
"That seems like that's all you do, regina."
You need to be out looking for a job.
Stop trying to run away from your problems.
What?
!
"Come on, mom."
What are you talking about?
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
"Well, if you can't hear me,"
Maybe i need to write it down
So you can read it.
"you need a job, regina."
Tell me something i don't know!
Don't you ever raise your voice
And use that tone to me again.
i am your mother
"And i will be until the day i die,"
And you will not disrespect me.
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm gonna go run now, ma'am."
Do i have your permission?
"Go on, regina."
"Lord, i ain't slapped nobody in 20 years."
Hello?
Okay.
We will add numbers to the beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this?
"If it were a test, I could skip the questions I can't answer."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
Can you come down to the cashier?
Why?
What happened?
"This way, please."
The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock.
Where are you?
I tried.
I tried them all.
None of them worked.
That's impossible.
I am out of here or we'll get caught.
"No, wait."
Try again by putting them at the beginning.
"Ma'am, there was a little misunderstanding."
Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
"Actually, I was kind of in a hurry."
You've wasted my time.
"Come on, baby."
Let's get out of here.
It's not working.
None of it's working.
"Come on Uluc, work your head."
What password would a mathematician use?
"For the sake of my happiness, won't you let me have a month of my life?"
"Please Babuji, give me one month"
Go.
Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
"At Robbie's party, no?"
I don't go to parties.
- Great!
"Nor do I, ever"
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother.
"Like you, her eyes too had hues of yellows and blues"
Keep reading.
I only wanted to find out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
"Simran, you're here?"
I heard you've missed the train.
"- No, I took it"
I was afraid...
Do you still have the photographs?
"Yeah, I have everything inside."
"Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?"
Copy that.
"Be right back, billy."
What are you hoping to find?
We're trying to clear a good man's name.

"These are, uh, these are all from the enright crime scene."
"Okay, let's scan those."
All right.
Let me invert the images.
"All right, there's jesse, there's the house,"
"The front gate, more house."
"What else we got, eric?"
wait a minute.
"Eric, go back."
Go back.
What is he doing?
"Evidence marker number four, eric."
"Number four, that's the cuff link."
That's the missing evidence.
Right.
Who is this?
I don't know.
It isn't cardoza.
It's not jesse.
Who is that?
Let me clean up the flare on his face.
Hitting the highlights.
Clean up some of this mess.
Captain sutter.
"Good morning, doctor."
"Hello, Commissioner."
She died.
Just a few hours ago.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes..."
She was murdered?
Difficult to say.
The pulse is very weak.
"Janitor, a glass of water, please."
"Go, drink."
He probably absorbed a violent narcotic.
He'll be back.
Go away!
What do you want?
I am a physician.
Ease your mind.
Breathe quietly.
Deeply.
Tell us what happened to you.
My head hurts.
What happened to me?
"I do not know, I do not know."
"Ah, yes!"
"Yes, yes!"
"I was reading, last night and suddenly, some people came out of hiding and pounced on me."
"I wanted to free myself, but I was gagged, and they pierced my arm with something sharp."
I lost consciousness.
"I wanted to scream, move, but I was powerless."
I sank.
"But who are you, sir?"
The Commissioner eighteenth borough.
"When you were attacked, you were alone?"
"- Yes, but..."
As soon as we arrive...
The Prime Minister will never accept her
First hear him ask him.
"Yes, but the Prime Minister..."
I hear things... \ It's strange.
This experience is like...
Like a gift.
"Here, among the people."
"I understand, sire."
"They're so welcoming and open, and..."
Here people do not have much.
Here people do not have much.
But I'm still...
That must be the Serbian border.
Let me do this this time.
Sire?
"You will not want the protocol to waste time, right?"
"No protocol, Ludovic."
"Carlos, take the camera."
Hello.
"- Passports, please."
Good morning.
Do the Serbian phones work?
- No phones.
How come the welcome concert?
- It is the Serbia In Ball dance campaign.
The state wants us to give a positive image of Serbia to foreigners.
Go for a walk.
You have a familiar look.
It looks like Miss Serbia 2005.
"2006, for precision."
Who are you?
You jest.
You jape.
I am one of Britain's top comic talents.
"- Say something funny, then."
- Yeah.
"If you're so funny, why don't you say something funny?"
"Go on, say something funny."
"All right, then, I will, I will."
Erm...
Plop.
"- Oh, dear."
- Damn.
Mistimed it.
I'll have to get the manager.
Mr Forsyth!
"Listen, bitch, I was once continuity link man on TVS."
I don't see why I should have to pay for my food.
"Listen, dickhead-no money, no food."
Ah.
Ooh.
You're the sort of girl I could fall in love with.
"However, no time, because Richie?"
- Yes?
- Run!
- I meant through the door.
"- Oh, sorry."
I thought they'd never give up.
Mr Forsyth had some stamina.
Safe and sound now and time to get on with my wonderful dinner party.
That's what you think.
But I have been thinking.
"Here, take off your trunks."
Hold this.
Okay.
And then put on these jogging shorts.
People are watching!
Oh!
Here.
Come on.
Come on.
Drink this very slowly.
Slowly.
"Babs, damn it, turn around."
- I'm your trainer.
- I don't suppose anyone here knows the origin of the marathon.
The Greeks met the Persians in battle...
Sit down.
On a great plain called Marathon.
The Greeks were victorious and sent a runner back to the city with the glorious news.
The distance was that of the modern marathon.
"- Rick, what are you doing?"
"- We need another sock, Coach."
One more sock.
Lacing up shoes.
The young man ran at top speed...
"Shoes, please."
That's too tight!
It's too tight!
"T.C., I'm dry!"
I'm dry!
"He stumbled through the gates of the city, cried out """" Rejoice, rejoice, """
and fell dead.
There's a lesson there.
It's Peter.
Right?
Yeah.
"And, Jeanine, can I just say that it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person?"
FOUR:
"Congratulations, Mother."
You got your war.
I know you wish there was another way.
But there isn't.
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?
You'd better be.
JEANNE'.
"Tell me, why did you surrender to Erudite?"
What do you want?
I would like a position in your regime.
"Ideally, I would like a position with some advancement opportunities."
(LAUGHS)
"I may be Dauntless, but I'm not just a meathead."
"No offense, Max."
(SCOFFS)
Prove your worth to us.
Then we can discuss your ambitions.
Great.
When do I start?
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.
How do I flush her out?
"PETER""."
Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.
Where's your friend?
-Ariving.
Your cop friends?
Around are.
Are they here?
Just me now.
You and that fucking gun who do not know how to use it.
What happened Luu?
Dead.
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
"This is a big problem for your friend, you know that?"
I do not think so.
Do not you know?
What the fuck do you want?
You and that stupid gun.
I saw how much you're handy with miracle.
-Sit down.
Have a seat.
Sit down or I'll kill you.
"Listen, man."
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like Andes?
He kills people.
You kill people.
"Deserve it, your wife and child."
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident.
-Accident?
People have to come to me with a certain respect.
Some things can not tolerate.
"When someone accuses me of something,"
I take that as an insult.
Move!
Go!
Go!
- Najim!
"No, wait He's coming."
He's coming.
Stop the car.
- Quickly.
- Come on...
Come on...
Good boy.
Well done.
(GUARD GROANING)
That's not my usual fantasy.
Usually you're wearing latex and a strap on.
"I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humour, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or are you still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
You knew that.
And you fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine yards to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott, you know."
But unfortunately I can only rescue you at the moment.
Lucky me.
Bitch.
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- How many years?
One?
Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Partners back each other up.
You have no business telling me how partners should treat each other.
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?
"I hate to tell you this, but you're not a homicide detective any more."
"- 9221, this is base."
Come in.
- Hardy.
We've got another 111.
Northshore.
East of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Now!
"If the kids have any bad dreams, call this number."
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.
"Kids, come on."
Let's go home.
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?
- The body was dumped last night.
Who visits him?
Nobody.
He is all alone.
"Earlier his daughter would write to him, every week."
- That doesn't happen anymore.
- Why not?
"She died, poor thing."
"It was a car accident, January 2006."
Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone.
"Poor man, all broken down."
I understand.
What was his daughter's name?
Natasha.
Natasha Malhotra.
Can I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports?
Why not.
But it could take some time.
"I'll have to go through some of the old files, you see."
Sure.
I will have someone call you later.
Is that okay?
- No problem.
- Thank you.
"We're done, let's go."
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
One thing is certain.
The murder wasn't committed by Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
Right.
But he was the reason for it.
Being cryptic suits you... not this case.
Okay.
Hello!
Help!
Help me!
So you've been looking for the daughter of Milonkovic?
Why?
We think it would be in the car.
We began the search yesterday.
Daughter reported missing in Sweden.
She lives with her mother in Gothenburg.
Did you know about the person in the trunk?
-Yup.
-What Was the fucking game then?
Why did not you tell us?
Hello?
-I Can not say.
All right.
Let's forget whims and pride and work.
You then have the theory that she was in the trunk?
-Is It possible.
-And She was saved by someone that killed the other?
-Deixamos All options open.
"-Legal, Sikkeland."
Mutual-confidence now?
"-surely, On my part."
Where is she from?
Stay there!
-Fatalidades Or injury?
-Still Are there.
-Milonkovic Was there?
I do not know.
The explosive was in the back.
I suppose you have a good view of it and the league-Z?
You see?
Okay bring the pry bars in.
Push!
Get them in there!
Get them under.
"Good, good."
That's it.
Watch your clothes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
Weahh!
Sorry Indy.
"Indy, why does the floor move?"
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction."
So please eat something.
I must apologize for the treatment of you.
Yeah?
Who's idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
This particular time and place and for my work they are necessary evils.
Not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world we are not entirely uncivilized."
Beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
Ha!
I bet you would.
"Stop, I say!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Cancel those shipments of wine, grain, straw!"
Cancel everything!
"- Dennis, here she is."
Griselda!
- Here I am.
It's me!
"Dennis, it was always you!"
You's the one we was pushing for.
We'll have the wedding tomorrow.
This afternoon.
We'll get the bishop.
"Dennis, you're wonderful."
"Griselda, at last we can have the life we always wanted."
"My boy, congratulations."
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.
You have cleared the kingdom of a great menace.
I am happy to fulfill my promise and to bestow upon you...
- What's his name?
- It's Dennis.
"Dennis Cooper, Your Royalshipness."
"That's his fiancée, my daughter."
"You, Dennis one half of my entire kingdom."
"And the hand in marriage of my daughter, the princess."
"Come, my boy."
To the palace!
Griselda!
I pronounce you man and wife.
Prince and princess!
Dennis!
Griselda!
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
Hallo!
Hallo!
It's trash.
Oh look!
It's working.
"Look, isn't it manually propelled?"
Mine also works.
Perfectly!
Try it with this.
-It's splendid!
-It's something.
It's really something.
"You have two days off, go to the forest and pull yourself together."
"Yes, nature is beautiful."
"Sometimes I jack it in and go to a forest somewhere, to nature's bosom."
"A forest, what can be more beautiful?"
"The clearing, stumps... deer, foxes, otters, seals, giraffes..."
Walruses...
Ah...
I can't remember the last time I was there.
"A propos of the report, do you have it for me?"
"No, I..."
Quiet.
Be quiet.
Be quiet.
We're only human.
"Accompany the doctor, please."
"Comrade director, a delegation is waiting for you."
Are the scissors prepared?
It's beautiful!
"Isn't it beautiful, when all the houses are the same?"
There's such an order in it.
"Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you.
Die!
She took a blow to the head when it hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard
- That's an order.
Tile?
What happened?
Where's colonel Sheppard?
He went after the creature.
You let him go alone?
"Well, he wanted me to stay with you."
I am fine.
Go.
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?
Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
Who decides when it's one of those times?
We do.
That's good enough.
Ellia... don't make me do this.
You okay?
Yeah.
She tried feeding on me.
She wasn't going to let us take her back.
Yeah.
I know.
Stargate Atlantis -=the end=-
What a great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
"There is smoke from the chimneys, they're inside."
Will you turn that off?
This is a library.
What a fucking chode.
- What the fuck?
!
"- Oh, my God."
"You know, the whole reason people come to the stacks... is for some peace and... quiet."
"Look, I know, I'm sorry."
I hate it when people disturb me here too.
It's just this fucking calculus final is killing me.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.
- You're actually very close.
May I?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I touched your breast.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You just go--
Wow.
You're good at this.
Thanks.
"What did you, like, take calculus in high school or something?"
"Actually, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade."
"What, are you like Doogie Howser?"
No.
Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.
I love that show.
What are you working on there?
This is just a poem for my creative writing class.
Please.
Your turn.
- Tired?
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure.
I have some old movies.

Go to sleep.
Are you just looking or buying?
- I'm not sure yet.
"- So, it seems to be going well."
- Have you?
"- No, and it's made no difference."
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?
I was just telling Henry how sex isn't an issue for us.
"It's much less complicated this way, not to mention sanitary."
It feels so good to be writing again.
I have so many ideas for the new book!
It's coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.

"Choong Sik, Choong Sik..."
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Stay out of it!
Sister-in-law...
Sister-in-law!
Stupid!
Don't get involved.
Don't get involved and go home.
But Yoon Jae...!
He's being careless with you!
"Brother-in-law is right, you stupid."
"And if you get involved, it'll make things more complicated."
So just hurry up and go home.
Just listen to me and go home.
"When you get thirsty, drink water instead of the carbonated drinks."

"For the time being, since there's mom inheritance... they won't throw you away."

I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
Bye.
What are you trying to do?
Mind your own business.
How long do you intend to stay here?
Don't try to change the subject.
"Captain, please play another round with me."
Just concentrate on practising for the upcoming competition.
I wish to start immediately.
I'm about to leave.
What are you talking about?
I don't have much time already.
What do you mean?
We'll talk about it later.
"Hurry up, go for practice."

What's this all about?
They won't let Yan-ling see you.
You must have provoked them!
No!
He said there can be no disturbing the chess game.
Is it true?
It's the Highness's order.
No disturbance from anybody.
Please go to Mr. Chao!
And you two better leave.
You better go back!
Fung-wu!
"Go back, don't cause any trouble!"
Let's go!
I feel something odd will happen tonight.
Now why is chess so mysterious?
It's a game.
You go on ahead.
I'll keep watch here.
Make sure you don't fight!
I won't!
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
I want to acquire the mystery of Shaolin kung-fu.

"Yeah, sure."
"Mr. Fuentes, it's Detective Martinez."

"Okay, good."
"You work nights, right?"
"Well, how about tomorrow morning?"
Great.
"All right, just ask for Detective Martinez or Medavoy."

How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!
Adam...
The auction is about to start.

What's he playing?
You have to run the auction.
Me?
Yes.
Fuck!
Christos!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You're the oldest.
"It has to be a Clios, naturally."
That's the way things are done.
"This night, this gala might affect the situation of every one of us."
Great.
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.
This is all very impressive.
That's very kind of you.
A vision!
"Oh, forgive me..."
I had a few things I had to tie up.
"Please, not another word."
"So impressive of you, I thought, to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss."
"I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't..."
"No, not at all!"
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.
Even afterworking hard all day..
"..even after starving, I collected only 900 rupees."
I cant understand what to do.
"Brother, this is Mumbai city."
"If you lose hope so soon, then.."
..you wont be able to do anything.
Then what else should I do?
"How can a man, who earns just 50 or 100 rupees.."
"..a day, pay back sirs Ioan worth lakhs of rupees?"
"If your intentions are good, then you can do anything."
No!
"To earn money, a man needs to be smart.."
..cunning and educated.
"And I am an illiterate, a duffer, foolish."
What can I do?
Everything will be alright.
God is there.
hell make everything alright.
Oh God!
Make me worth getting sirs old days back!
"65, 1, 1."

Hanging high as a star.
Flying light as butterfly
Kicking hard as the top star.
How's that?
What?
Isn't that right?
"You're okay, but, not good enough!"
Not good enough?
"You know these 3 stances have turned me into a strong man, look!"
"If so, why don't you work in the fields?"
You think I'm an ox?
Ox?
"Well, you aren't as big as that!"
"What then, you mean I'm puny?"
I can see that you're like a Mongol doctor
Sick or not sick as he wishes.
Lemme show you
Come!
Okay

Left punch!
Right punch!
Wah!
Really fierce

Want to know how I defeated you?
Of course!
Then come again!
Hanging high as a star!
And the second one?
Um...
I know I've made a lot of mistakes.
"I still don't know what I'm doing, you know."
I never meant to hurt you.
My son.
My boy.
My baby boy.
"My flesh and blood, pa."
But you ain't no baby no more.
You can make your own decisions.

Glad you're enjoying yourself.
"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination."
Now they have a delightful social aspect.
"Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before."
Of course I have.
But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
"- What, screw with you?"
Because I can.
You're my son.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't be 15 minutes early like you are.
I have an actual job I go to.
"- Collecting disability, I'm sure, is not as time-consuming as whatever you're doing."
Do you two need a minute?
I can come back.
No.
It's fine.
"What are you having, Dad?"
I'm buying.
I'll have a couple of scrambled.
Is that all?
You don't want bacon?
You love bacon.
Get bacon.
He loves bacon.
Get him some bacon.
Rye toast.
Right?
And I'll have scrambled egg whites and avocado.
Thank you.
Avocado?
Is that what you eat with your lawyer friends?
Avocado.
- I'll be right back.
Why do we...
"Can we just, like, try to have a normal conversation of some kind?"
I'm not starting anything.
- Fine.
You got that?
"Got that,"
Capt. Kechichian?
We were up late.
For a good cause.
"Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM, after defacing the wall of a Government building, how can I fault you for being so admirable!"
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.
We got a tip off from an informant.
A reliable source?
Not at all.
What do you say?
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.
"Barring a lucky break, he'll be tough to nail."
Luck can be engineered.
Briefing's over!
"Vrinks, you stay."
I've been appointed Police Commissioner.
As of when?
I take over on Sept 1.
Congratulations.
I hate to leave before I've cleaned house.
"I want that gang, Leo."
As my farewell gift.
You'll get them.
Another thing:
someone will get my desk.
You're the right man.
Klein wants to be Chief.
Yeah.
Yeah.

"Too many people like your cousin here, gettin' sent back."
"Look man, I ain't tryin' to come back."
"So, you intend to cease your criminal activities then?"
(chuckles)
Right...
"Well, a passport, 25,000 US dollars."
"Yo, what happened to fifteen?"
That was years ago!
"Now, homeland security, makin' tings a lot tougher for the little man."
"The normal rate is 30,000 US dollars."
"So, guys..."
Take it or leave it.
Let's go.
Fuck you mean we got no money!

"Sorry, I tried a thing, I got jacked--"
"I told you stay off that shit, didn't I tell you?"
I told you!
"Money got tight, alright--"
What do you mean money got tight?
Huh?

"When I got pinched, we had enough cash!"
All you had to do was stay in school.
"I dropped out, okay?"

LASALLE:
"You okay, Dana?"
"Yeah, I think so."
Nice driving.
"You, too."
(grunts)
"Can't guarantee Dana won't spend some time behind bars, Mr. Connors."
"I mean, after all, she was complicit until she wasn't."
"Yeah, I know."
"But I spoke to the federal prosecutors, told them everything she did to help us bring down the crew."
"Plus, she's cooperating, so I'm hopeful."
"At least one way or the other, she's out from underneath it... finally... and safe."
That's all I wanted.
That's all Jared would've wanted.
Take care.
Yeah.
(clears throat)
Poor dude.
He's been through a lot.
"Gonna go through a lot more, too."
"Losing a child, nothing harder."
Sort of know how he feels.

Are you questioning a royal order?
"No, believe me, if we were, we wouldn't be taking it up with the messenger boy."
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)
"If you come now, you won't be arrested."
Very well.
I'll see you back at the garrison.
Get him some food.
"You'll stay here until nightfall then, we'll take you out of Paris under cover of darkness."
"And please don't draw attention to yourself, hmm?"
Where are you going?
I must make sure my absence has not been noted.
But I will be back.
"Oh, and remember, if any of Grimaud's men ask your name, it is?"
"- ""Victor""."
I know.
"- Yes, quite right."

You've been in there ages!
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.
"You all right in there, Sharon?"
Yeah.
Coming.
"Ah, no, no."
There's no hurry.
"No, I've been in already."
Ohh...
"Jesus, what were you drinking last night?"
I'm going back to bed.
"Ah, yeah, go on."
Good girl.
"I'll go on without you, what?"
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.
Get in there and get your clothes on.
"Go down to get your breakfast... and get a bleedin' job for yourself, right?"
"Sharon, we're going to have to tell them."
"Stop it, will yous?"

It's...

- How unromantic.
You do that?
- Casper taught Frank to do it.
- I could've thought of it myself.
"- Look, buster!"
Don't discuss our sex life with him!
I didn't.
Then how does he know what you do?
- I don't know...
- I won't have it!
- Let me finish...
- No!
"You fuck retards and lick the alphabet, you jerk!"
"- Please don't move your leg, Casper."
- I thought you were handicapped.
- I'm sorry about the retard.
- That was a lousy thing to do.
- Golf tomorrow?
- You bet.
It's nice and peaceful.

I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.

Thank you.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.

Going for a take.
And take this cucumber.
Nefedov gave it to me.
Eat!

"And if you can improve your physical strength as well, nobody can beat you."
Thanks for your kind teaching.
You never practice.

- What?
Never mind.
Lipstick.

"Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it."

I have an early class.
- All right.
Have a nice day.
"- Oh, by the way..."
- Mmm?
Would saying now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?
Or should we wait till you come back from Europe?
"Yeah, that's better."
"No, no..."
That's fine.
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day.

This is Trudy.

"And once people knew what we were going through,"
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof.
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly.
"I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel."
Just tell her how you feel.
"Well, I think if you looked at everything that..."
"No, no, no, no."

Don't explain intellectually how you feel.
"You know, just tell her how you feel."

"And I'm guessing ""tranny"" means something different to me than it does to you."
"What does ""tranny"" mean to you?"
"""Tranny"" means the transmission."
Really?
I think we need to get you a drag name.
"Oh, no."
You're in San Francisco.
"I mean, everybody has a drag name here."
Ready?
Wait.
We're naming her miss Tess Tosterone.
"""Miss Tess tosterone."""
You know what?
That's pretty funny.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.

This is not good.
No.
No.
No.
They're coming over here.
- Fucking shit.
Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather around me here!

"Addons I say, without confrontation, Dave."
"Addons, however, they talk all the time."
I did everything you asked me.
I have a passport.
The identity and details.
"It's not Max, is another."
"Addons A mysterious visitor,"
Addons at stake now.
I got her passport ..
Do not touch.
Do not touch it.
They take a hell damn life.
"Addons you have demonstrated your competence in action,"
Addons but not surprising.
Strength and the description is your point.
All right.
"So ... then .. and in peace, right?"
"Addons I'm sorry, Dave."
I'm afraid I can not do that.
Addons I have an additional task for you.
"Addons I want you, to kill one of the passengers."
Addons not have much time.
Addons I offer you three minutes.
tick .. tock Addons ...
Okay.
Who would you kill?
- What happened?
- He spent more than 6 minutes.
Dave ...
"- No, no."
Politics took care of that.
Same goes for flags.
He doesn't even weave them.
"Still, he designs them."
"He's part of the process as geopolitics, seamtresses."
"No more, no less."
So artists are vessels?
He asked me to be his assistant.
- Doing it?
- I don't know.
It's a tough decision.
Afghanistan is far.
Make it to Nepal?
Kabul was the end of that trip.
We had to get back.
Why?
Is it a secret?
"I brought my drawings... to the editors of ""Parapluie. """
"They have a band called ""Fille Qui Mousse""."
They want collages for their light show.
Waste of time.
Isn't there better to do?
Like what?
Like your paintings.
"You're starting out, like me."
You have progress to make.
I don't have much time.
I prefer to draw.
You're wrong.
I preferred your paintings.
Will you show them to me?
I'd rather not.
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.

Vive la gloire.
Vive Napoleon.

Officer Jaeger.

"Ein, zwei, drei, wirgehen vermittels schiessgewehr."
"I'm a scientist, not a military man."
"Oh, come now."
We're all military men under the skin.
And how we do love our uniforms.
What an interesting weapon you've got there.
Do let me see it.
Oh... yes.
"Now, let me see."
How does this work?
"Ah, yes."
"This won't kill, and this will."
Oh.
"Oh, how marvelous!"
Devastating!
"Why, this could kill millions."
"Who will you start with, my crew?"
Are we your next targets?
"Oh, how absolutely typical of your species."

That was a board decision about an entire department.
Griff is one person who slipped.

"Relapse is inevitable, if that's what happened."

"Griff had one, two bad weeks."
"Before then, a year where he wasn't a problem."
"Hey, I warned him, Allen!"
Think about the stress that he was under
"- the explosion, the suicide..."
- It's still no.
- He just needs another chance.
"- Allen, stop!"
It's no.
One for the road?
- You hungry?
- I could eat.
I heard you got fired.
Yeah?
"Whatever,"
"I couldn't stand it there, to be honest."
Yeah.
My whole family works there.
- Nightmare.
- Total nightmare.
To freedom.
"So you and Zoe, huh?"
Stop!
It's none of your business!
You'll get hurt!
I told you!
You'll get hurt.
You traitors mixed the two factions.
"No, we haven't."
"Actually, they're the same style."
"Yes, you just haven't realized it."
Kung-fu is no fixed motion!
It's endless!
Go!
Stop!
Stand back!
They're geniuses to have mixed the two factions.
I must kill the two traitors!
"Brother, they set a good example."
We shouldn't kill them.
Fung-wu's master and Jun-kit's sister were killed by us so that we could learn their styles.
"They taught us, so they're our masters now."
Release them!
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
- He's a monk now!
- He's a monk now!
Master!
"Yan-ling, behave like a girl!"
"Master, I wish to go to the restaurant with you."
Go then!
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
What did you say?
Vomit!
I am telling you to turn down the car.
Which one?
This one or that one?
"I am sick of his question answers,"
How are you?
"Give me two batteries, Which ones, Big, Medium or small?"
Remote batteries?
Which remote batteries?
"VCD, DVD or TV, To explode a bomb remote's battery."
Khade chand!
Yes!
Madam!
"Did you hear, what I hear?"
"I've seen it photo, today this diamond is mine, Papa"
"One, Two, Three."
"And say one, two, three."
"It exploded, papa?"
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
Since morning you have been humiliating me!
You humiliated me in the car!
You've humiliated me a lot.
You humiliated me in front of these girls!
I will..
Hey!
Rangeela's Jackie Shroff!
Quiet!
You are beating me in front of everybody.
What can I do if the battery is not functioning!
- You got it.
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?
- He saved my brother.
He's a doctor.
"- Here, let's roll on this."
We're at the scene of an incredible rescue.
It appears that a doctor has saved a little boy from drowning.
"We got it, doc."
Call Mercy.
- Mercy's not a Level 1trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.
We gotta follow station protocol.
- What's your transport time?
"- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes."
- Where's your pilot?
"- Hey, Jimmy!"
Over here!
"- Sorry, doc."
We got to move.
"- Wait, wait."
We're losing time.
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.
"- He's hypothermic, needs special care."
- Mercy is closer.
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
- You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just... want...
- You just want to be free.
- Exactly.
- Hmm.
- Thank you.
- Isabel!
- Roderick.
- My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
- I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
- And how is the famous doctor?
- The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"- Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
- I'm sorry.
"Dr. Cairn says it's a part of the healing process, the side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"- Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Who are you?
I'm Edith.
The lady of the May.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is it?
At our 3 o'clock!
New enemy!
New enemy closing in from dead ahead!
They're attacking as a team?
"From overhead, too!"
Incoming!
A Landing Castle...
"All units, brace for impact!"
Multiple Landing Castles...
Multiple Kataphraktoi...
Simultaneously!
He's made his move!
It's him!
Right.
It's too late for doubts now.
There is no returning from this place I have come to.
It was an uneventful morning... quiet.

At the South-hill plot?

A boat sailing before the wind carried it over with great difficulty!
How about you?
So far!
"Monkey somersaulted 18,000 miles I took the grapes and lifted my heels and walked 109,200 miles!"

Try .. quiet!

Who are you?
If you say ...
My friends would be in danger.
And my family.
And we?
I had a sister.
Thi does not matter.
Crazy fool!
How many pro like you were there?
Asshole.
Do you think I get involved?
"Max, if you want us to believe, You have to prove who you are."
If you do not want to tell us and then show us.
Empty your pockets!
Now!
And passports.
Take out of pocket ...
Tell the truth.
Are you happy now?
Stupid stupid!
Enough for now.
Who was it?
Do you want me to sort him out for you?
"Sure, I already offered..."
"Grow up, will you?"
No bullets?
No.
"Well, what's the point of giving you a gun... if they don't give you Jesus bullets?"
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.
I thought that was the point.
How else you supposed to keep the bleedin' peace?
"That's crazy, that is."
"It was no joke, all right?"
You had to look straight at 'em.
- Who?
- The Arabs.
Straight at them.
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.
"Easier said than done, I'd say."
Who are you telling?
Thanks.
"Hit me, will you?"
Get out!

Your theory was right.
Those were kids from the tattoo shop.

No!

"And if you win, everything will be okay for Roger and me."
"I mean, the police will find him and... and he'll give back the money and we'll get married."
You know what I mean?
"Yeah, I know."
Beauty Knows No Pain.
Yeah.
?
Beyond the reef?
?
Where the sea is dark and cold?
?
My love has gone?
?
And our dreams grow old?
?
Someday I'll know?
?
She'll come back?
"Remember, this is your best event."
So don't go saving your energy for the other events.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't forget.
"Moroni, stop it or I will make you regret it."
"Italia,"
You do not understand it that it makes time that I wait for each moment?
-Moroni...
-And now that we are alone...
"Moroni, be carefull..."
"Italy, I wish you, you the very many desire."
"Moroni, the request, does not do that."
"But, how you dare?"
Beauty that I...
"No, you do not have to beat to me because I am terrible..."
"Moroni, have I hurt you?"
Moroni?
Moroni?
Have i hurt you?
Moroni?
Little baby?
Little baby?
Little baby.
Call me Ben.
Idiot!
"-Eh, boys, you come here."
-You arrive behind schedule.
-Italia is done...
-What said to you?
The next time we will also do the Italians.
You speak like a politician.
"Alvaro, if your parents speak with mine, we are of excursion?"
in agreement?
"Yes, we are all in Honolulu."
You do not worry.
The suntan oil!
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Is your mother back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Does your mother approve?
- Sure.
She always gives a lot herself.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize ...
Normally we don't take money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we can do it."
"Well, take a good look at how beautiful this house is."
They can afford it.
"As thanks for the donation, I have here a plaster."
Help!
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Please prove that you're our mother.
Ask her what my favorite song is.
What is Lukas' favorite song?
"""Good evening, good night""?"
Don't!
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them.
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
Max?
Do not touch anything.
- He will be seen.
- Why does not this display?
Please do not touch anything.
Stop it.
Please tell ...
Please leave.
I think this is display the information.
It will take us where is electricity.
We do not have to do this.
I have it.
Caught.
What the heck?
We're not going to New York.
What?
Where do we go?
Norway?
We're going to Oslo.
What is it?
Why are they doing this?
- I do not think that should be done.
- What did you say?
It can not be them.
What do you think of everything that is legal?
- Did you talk with co pilot?
- This is a competition!
Do you think that the network Social killing people?
I have to go to pilot.
There are people dying because we are breaking the rules.
We will follow the game no one else was hurt.
They can not kill everyone.
Madame Sand!
"Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!"
"delighted to meet you, Baroness."
"I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz."
"He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in."
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes.
We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes.
- But she's ill now.
- How sad.
And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet!
(Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
"- Do you pray, Baroness?"
"- If you must know, I'm secretly devout."
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
"well, no."
There... is the answer.
Dr. Cairn had it personally adjusted for you.
- Thank you.
- Very good.
Please!
Please don't do this!
Where is Dr. Cairn?
!
"- Dr. Cairn has given you to me, my exquisite... pitiful little creature."
"- I'll do better, I promise."
Please give me a second chance.
"Please, please."
- Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.
This is a special day.
"- No, no, no."
- A celebration.
"- No, no, no."
- In your honour.
- No.
"Life is changed, not taken away."
Bodies grow slowly and die quickly.
- How have your dreams been of late?
"- After my parents' passing,"
I had the most frightful nightmares.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now... my dreams are different.
- Different how?
"Isabel, we spoke about this last week."
"Without complete honesty, the healing cannot take place."
"- Yes, sir."
"Lately, my dreams have been... strange."
"They feel so real, I hardly know where the dream ends and reality begins."
- No.
Someone has to look after the injured.
We can't take them with us.
- All right.
"- Thank you, Mariá."
I have a question.
"Do you love this country, your homeland?"
"Yes, señor."
Have you explained that we're fighting this war for them?
"Yes, I have, señor."
So why are they staring at me as if I was a venomous snake?
They're just watching you eat because they're not going to get any food today.
Commandante!
Commandante!
What's the matter?
I've intercepted a radio message.
It wasn't even encoded.
They're going north.
So are Silveira and his militia.
- And they've requested helicopters.
- We're leaving right now.
- Get ready.
We're leaving.
- Mariá will take you to San Juan.
Helicopters!
"Oh, my God!"
"Into the jungle, everybody!"
Hurry up!
Take cover!
The helicopters are coming!
Hurry up!
Get into the jungle!
"- Take him forward, put him under guard."
- Jones.
Another flogging.
Pass the word:
We do a full tryout tomorrow at eight bells.
First Lieutenant said keep a sharp lookout to starboard.
"You men on gun three, jump to it!"
Station two marines in the after well deck at six bells.
- Steer east-nor'east.
"- Aye, aye."
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
"- Yes, sir."
- Have you noticed anything?
"- Noticed what, sir?"
A number of small things.
Like a man shouting without a sound.
"- I don't know what you mean, sir."
- All right.
He saw you do it.
- Why did you?
- That's the signal.
Three cheers.
"- Next time, be careful."
- When are we gonna do it?
- The real thing?
- You'll be told.
We did what we said.
We join the fleet in Corsica with something to show.
A fully-pledged ship.
Ready for action.
Not a single bloody ship.
Nothing in the harbor.
Yes.
Has this ever happened before?
No.
You've answered your own question.
But what if this 'Happily ever after'... becomes 'Happy never after' after some time?
You are right.
And you have a great track record too.
What if you get bored?
You are no Ms. Virtuous either.
Correct.
"Okay so the issue is, how do we trust each other?"
"So the issue is, is this feeling enough?"
- No..
- Then..
"The issue is, do we get this feeling with someone else or not."
Oh...
It's like a buffet out here.
So find some new fancy dish for yourself..
..and I'll find someone for myself.
And we'll know.
Hold on.
"Ideal bachelor, great catch."
- What are you doing?
This is too risky.
- Please.
Shiv.
Hi..
I'm leaving.
The things I've to do for her.
Just watch.
Same here.
That was a big mistake.
"Area one, clear!"
"Area three, clear."
"Room clear, stand down."
Is there any news on Richard yet?
"Well, he wasn't at the flat."
We've done our bit.
You've certainly done yours.
You all right?
He'll run.
Start afresh.
They've sent out an alert to all airports and stations.
But what if he's already gone?
Hello?
What?
Fantastic.
"OK, just hold on, would you?"
Someone matching the description of Richard Henderson boarded the Eurostar to Brussels.
The police picked him up at Ashford.
They've got him!
I've been tying to work out what I did wrong.
"Come on, it's killing me, what was it?"
Something I said or...
It was something you touched.
The picture.
Caught out by Jesus!
How irritating!
Irritating?
Is that your summary of what's happened?
"Oh, please, don't expect me to express guilt."
Come on!
You killed those people.
Why?
Why do not you make yourself room.
I'm exhausted.
No heart!
DEATH ...
Book of death?
How to use it .
This is English.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
This works if has the face of the person in mind.
This is ineffective on people of the same name and surname.
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds for that to happen.
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause.
Very fun.
Ouch!
I will not let go .
I would have preferred it to disappear
Ridiculous.
- This is his?
- Yes.
"Yagami, you know some Sakota?"
- Yes.
- Mr. Yagami Light.
Yes.
I checked the content and it's your mobile phone.
He was in his jacket pocket.
Uh...
He reportedly died.
Died?
Water boils!
Last night 23 to 30 h at a motorcycle race he crashed into the barriers a crossing.
He died instantly.
You know him?
You...
[Giggling]
"- Oh, my poor boy!"
"- Why do you say that, Doctor?"
"Well, it just occurred to me:"
You must be under tremendous emotional strain:
Strain?
No:
Why?
"Because when that simulacrum of Wilma was destroyed, well, you lost the Goral of your dreams, didn't you?"
The Goral of your dreams!
You lost her!
[All Groaning And Laughing]
All Things Pass
Darling.
Darling.
Dorien.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
"Even if it's the last thing I'll do, Niels is a dead man."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Will you take the garbage bags out?
"-Yes, darling."
"It's not easy is it, old man?"
But I did keep up with you!
Worthless scrolls.
Where's the treasure?
I think you're looking at it.
That's right.
Solon himself said the Treasure of Atlantis has the power to command men's minds.
"Of course, books."
No.
It can't be true.
The Treasure of Atlantis... is knowledge.
There has to be more.
No!
You're destroying the scrolls!
Get away you stupid old fool.
I want treasure.
We gotta go.
But all this knowledge.
We can't let it be destroyed.
"Kelly, come on!"
"Come on, Kelly!"
Forget that.
"Well, that's our only way out."
Maybe we can tap into a little geothermal power of our own.
Geothermal power?
Professor.
Yes?
Stuff your jacket into one of those pipes.
Put a rock on top of it.
"Kelly, stand by the Torch."
"Well, whatever you've got in mind, MacGyver, hurry."
"Stand back, professor."
"All right, Kelly, hit it."
"Shut it off, Kelly."
They earn their living over three months.
"In winter, they sit around drinking tea."
There's not a lot to do in winter.
"Apparently, they're not that idle!"
"No, they do nothing."
They sit around the stove for warmth.
They spend evenings together.
Certain produce is sown in winter...
And harvested in summer.
I don't know.
Your harvest will soon be ripe.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
How many children do you have?
Nine.
"Well done, nine children!"
Yes.
How many girls and how many boys?
Five girls and four boys.
"See, you're not idle!"
May God preserve them.
Thank you.
You don't want to get up?
We have to get up?
You don't want to?
is there any news?
"News, but not what you think."
But there is something.
She didn't eat the soup sent by Mrs Hatcher and Mrs Terayn.
Meaning what?
Meaning...
Hold the line.
Such good intentions...
Hey!
Don't you care what happens to your friend?
!
Don't underestimate me!
It's resonating with him.
You had it.
Professor Mayzel.
and seal off this block!
Bastard!
I think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood was caused by the ark then the true power of the ark may be the ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
it is unknown territory.
We don't know what will happen.
Fine by me.
let's go.
Die!
Die!
no!
Damn!
Jean!
Jean?
Ominae what did you do with that brat?
I heard he's headed for the ark.
Dr. Mayzel and his assistant are hostages.
That should be taken care of first.
Jean.
quickly..!
Ominae!
Save those two by all means.
Goten!
You should not touch it so suddenly.
right?
It is an invention of mom.
She said that nothing could be detected with the award.
So we will not be able to see ...
Do not worry.
but ...
Did you see?
There is always some trick!
Trunks!
I'll show you the special prize!
Wow!
I'm hungry...
Pilaf-sama!
I'm a dog but this is too much!
what guarantees that this island is a treasure?
It's what this map says!
looking good ...
How could you believe this ?
!
the motor broke down because it is not of good quality.
we will not get to reach the port.
What are we going to do?
I am going to die here?
Stay calm and continue to seek the treasure!
I'm hungry...
I want to eat monjayaki ...
I do not get any fish or fish... right?
Wow!
right?
My mama collected these today!
Good.
Perhaps there's still time for you to see things
With a clear mind.
"I've wanted to be with you as well,"
But there is trouble at home.
Scotland is in peril.
"The english, I know."
It's worse.
Our country is on the knife's edge
Of falling into protestantism.
And we are catholic rulers.
"You need France, a catholic country, at your side now."
"Marry its next king,"
And the protestants will scurry into the darkness.
Marry francis.
Not some bastard who someday might be king.
His name is sebastian.
Has the same ring to it.
"Well, I have no choice"
"But to support you,"
As I rule scotland but you are
Actually its queen.
And my daughter.
So headstrong.
So loving.
So you'll be patient?
Yes.
Mary.
Are you all right?
Is all well with your mother?
Yes.
"She's just as I remember her,"
Badly.
"Well, we see."
"Lack of appetite, weakness, diminution of weight, asthenia, you feel nauseous, vomits."
And a pretty coloration bronzes.
Disease of Addison.
You know that you have much luck?
Only there are a case each ten thousands.
One each ten thousands.
Disease of Addison.
It hears?
you know that when I am in critical moment me...?
-You.
You.
The stomach.
"-Ah, very well, thanks."
"Yours no, cretino."
The one of the patient.
"Ah, yes."
"Professor, he does not think that he is embarrassed?"
It seems to you the moment for joking?
Cretino.
"It feels, feels."
You see it?
It is aerophagia.
Who has been?
"I will take you to all before the Academic Senate,"
I will cause that they expel to you...
"By charity, Cicchirini, we do not begin, will have been the echo."
"Make me case, you will not regret..."
Damn Ah... is.
"-Sir, want to come in?"
"-Yes, thanks."
"Good, plenty of rocks around."
"Good morning, daddy!"
So the young 'uns are up already.
"A beautiful good morning, miller."
Good morning...
wait...my cap... wait!
"'Morning, master."
How do we go about it?
Only a couple of sacks...
"You'll manage those on your own, Furface."
Johann can clean the dung out of the goat-shed.
- Dung?
Me?
- Dung.
Such swarms of them!
"Our boys'll fight like lions, your Highness."
- They had tough training.
- Our boys'll be killed.
We're far outnumbered!
They'll beat us just with their turbans!
Where're you from?
"From far away, Bohemia."
Bavorov.
Really?
My wife comes from Netolice.
"That's quite close, across the wood."
D'you think we can make them run?
How dare you doubt our victory!
It looks like my tough training did no good.
I'll show you!
Lock him up!
You won't forget me in a hurry.
BRENNAN:
Oh...
This is blood.
Aldo's?
"We can't be completely sure, there are tests..."
"Look at that, Bones."
Look.
That's the cage.
(Brennan groans)
Cam will want to do blood spatter analysis as soon as possible.
(camera snapping)
Bones.
I need to finish...
"No, look."
Look!
"Booth, that's a bomb!"
BOOTH:
"We got to go, now."
(grunting)
(gasping)
(Brennan groaning)
Crews are still battling the blaze at an abandoned office complex in Anacostia.
"The cause of the fire is undetermined, but fire marshals suspect the strong possibility of arson."
Booth says it was an IED.
"Yeah, but do IEDs usually take this long to burn off?"
HODGINS:
"No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas."
My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.
"It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees."
Which means there won't be much left.
Close to zilch.
"Whoa, Dr. B."
"Okay, you go on, I'll be right there I go first..."
Okay!
This is the best harvest ever!
"Ah-fang, you devil!"
Stop crashing around!
What're you in such a rush for you idiot?
I'm racing with Master Chang I left that old fellow 80 feet behind!
Eighty feet behind?
Who...who's that?
Somebody's stolen the grapes!
Yes...for the third time already!
Can we still make Night-sweet Premium?
"They really know their stuff, to steal here"
Come!
A thousand coppers a string!
Come!
Crystal grapes!
Real crystal grapes!
A rare chance!
A thousand coppers a string!
"Crystal grapes, come..."
Come on!
Taste them-real crystal grapes!
You can only get them here!
Real crystal grapes
Only here...
Taste them
"Taste them-only 1 ,000 coppers a string!"
"Have a taste, everybody!"
Eight hundred coppers-800 a string!
"Real crystal grapes, 800 a string!"
Six hundred a string!
Enough!
That's enough!
"If he doesn't remember you Joy, It only means... that his lost of memory is centered on the times you were together."
Is that why he can't remember me?
.
How long will this amnesia last?
.
Will he get his memory back?
.
"We can never tell right now, there are instances when the memories come back after a few weeks or months."
"But in some cases, the memory doesn't come back anymore."
But how is that?
I'm his wife.
Treat him like your patient.
I'll be out later.
"Come on, let's go there."
How are you feeling Migs?
.
How are you feeling Migs?
.
Who exactly are you?
.
I'm Joy.
I'm your wife.
I don't remember anything.
There are so many things I can't remember.
Son?
.
"Mom, what's happening?"
.
"Joy, can I talk to Migs for a while?"
.
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
[alarm ringing]
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
- Get that coolant flowing.
- [phone buzzes]
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
- [alarm continues buzzing] - who is this?
"[victor] this is Dr.VictorGannon,"
It's the finest picture I've ever seen.
"They've gone, every single one."
Who have?
- Percy's pack of suitors.
So will he be OK?
- Yes.
The whole thing has disappeared.
Roly's in seventh heaven.
"Morning, Helen."
"Morning, James."
"- (Helen) Morning, Siegfried."
A quiet night?
"Yes, only one call and that was delightful."
I delivered six bouncing Labrador puppies.
"That's right, my boy."
Your friend Mrs Farmer.
"-... noBankExchange."""""
-And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner...
... butweneedBankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy...
... it'spoliticallyexpedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
I'm talking about a 60-story building that'll employ 3000 people.
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George...
... FrankAnselmo'sin there.
Come.
Arrangements for the night is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same room?
You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed.
I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way.
I'm leaving
I'm not joking.
I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There!
You have a fire going
Granted.
You have a great sense of choice
"You couldn't find a better place to spend the night, right?"
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night with me in the stables.
Not in the room
Eat
-It's warming.
-I'm just going to the bathroom.
"We are the first from our galaxy, to enjoy this feeling."
An uplifting feeling.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Nature will do you good.
I will arrive after you...
Don't lose your temper.
You know it's bad.
"You'll take a rest, everything will be like before."
"My little bunny will go to a nice forest,"
"snuggle down, yes, snuggle down..."
"Tell me, why don't you follow the program?"
"Who's the lady, Doctor?"
What have you done now?
"Yirinka, please!"
These are only friends.
Yirinka!
Never get married doctor.
It's terrible!
Yirinka...
Enough!
"Guys, I surrender!"
I'm a goner.
Look at me.
I don't sleep.
I wanted to sleep with the lady!
"That is, get married!"
"And getting married, doctor, does it relate somehow to reproduction?"
Go away.
Go away!
You won't for long!
"I'll have your throat out, you bloody swine!"
- Another two dozen!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Another two dozen!
"- What's wrong with you, Evans?"
- It's got worm in it.
"I'll eat weevils and maggots, but not red worms!"
Good food thrown on the deck.
You're spoiled.
You know that's an offence.
A flogging offence.
"You know that too, don't you?"
- He sent you.
- What?
"Yes, sir."
I know it.
While we consider the best course of action pick it up!
It's fit.
Eat it.
Eat it.
That's an order.
"You'll swing for this, every man jack of you!"
He's right.
We'll hang for striking an officer.
We're all in it.
We have to move fast.
What shall we do?
There is only one thing to do.
Give the signal.
"- When, now?"
- As soon as we can.
I would know!
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!
"Yes, there was!"
"- Cooper, you need to calm down."
"- I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder."
- That's not possible.
"- Oh, my God."
"- It's not possible, Cooper."
"- Yeah, it is!"
"Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"- Unless, I mean..."
"- Oh, God."
Unless what?
I don't know.
"The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,"
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what?"
Stop the game.
I want out.
Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Safe word.
Fucking stop!
"- Okay, okay, just let us work it out."
"- Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
The great yoghurt investigation.
Oh.
I thought we would just be bringing our own lunch.
"Oh, I thought I'd bring lunch."
My treat.
"Oh, I thought we would just be having our own Tupperwares-type thing."
You weren't taking me out to lunch.
"No, but..."
It wasn't like a date.
No.
"I mean, two middle-aged people on a bench in Piccadilly."
"It's not exactly Roman Holiday, is it?"
No.
Be nice if it was.

How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
while arms reductions are progressing over the world the focus of our attentions is on environmental issues.
global warming... all of these problems can be solved.
Macdougal!
Our country must always be the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon have to have this?
they could end up destroying their own country.
What is your real purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
"I fall because of that girl, my heat has become candle."
One chance.
Only one chance.
Stand up.
And remember.
Forget about the girl and concentrate on the career.
I give you one more chance.
But keep in mind.
If your bullet would miss him.
Then my bullet will kiss you.
"This time i will shoot on throat, forget it!"
Shoot the rascal.
I am not even married yet.
Next week girl's parents are coming to see me.
Please let me go... i will free you first you free me.
On one condition.
Your every condition is accepted.
I will not kill him.
You will kill him.
No.
"No... don't do this... i have never even killed the bee, how can i kill a man?"
Teach him to kill bee.
You guys look very intelligent.
"Please let me go Sir,"
kill.
"Sir, what?"
Bee.
Bee?
Gently!
Its female.
Female?
Should not hurt.
Of course I am.
Take your hands off me.
- Sir?
Am I in error?
- Thank heaven you're here.
- You can see I'm a gentleman.
- Look at his lovely clothes.
"- Take him, Dawlish."
- But you can't.
"- Vizard, you sail tomorrow?"
"- Yeah, Mediterranean."
- So you should count us out for now.
- No need.
Spread word to that fleet.
"If both fleets struck at once, we'd win our demands overnight!"
"- You'll act soon, then?"
"- Yes, soon every ship will mutiny."
- Before spring?
- Depends.
How's your crew?
Forty more pledges.
- We have half the ship already.
- Good.
"Poor men, driven like cattle."
I don't understand it.
Having to be pressed to go to sea?
- Not everyone wants to leave home.
- Think of it!
Sailing the Defiant and fighting the French.
You sound just like your father.
"Anyway, the admiral may not agree to let you go."
Father's back.
"OK, long story, short version."
I was going to marry his ex-wife.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?
!
"What, and now you're mates, and everything?"
"(CHUCKLES) Well, mates is probably pushing it."
So where is she?
"His ex, your missus?"
She died.
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.
You weren't to know.
- What about you?
How do you know him?
- Don't.
Not really.
"As far as I'm concerned, he's this random smurf popped up out of nowhere."
So why the...?
Long time ago my dad killed this girl.
"It was by accident and everything, but... he panicked."
Cut her up and whatnot.
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
"So this bloke, Luther, was one of the coppers that put him away."
And your dad?
Killed himself in prison.
"Jenny, listen, I know how hard..."
how hard it can be.
Losing someone that way.
"so Yawang, you have to be happy!"
Yawang!
Yawang.
You will never know that my basic wish was
just to admire the paradise together with you.
I think we will see each other in the next life.
"At that time,"
I'll be waiting for you!
"At that time, if you don't come,"
I will stay young!
"At that time, you would not loose me again."

"Hey, Esther, how're you doing?"
Want a jelly bean?
"Oh, some of these are wet."
That's weird.
They should all be wet.
I'm going to go boil my hand.
MASON:
There's nothing to be scared of.
Just relax and go with what feels right.
CLARK:
This is all too much at once.
You can't deny your feelings.
[whispers]:
It's not that easy.
Ours is a forbidden love.
- Stop walking around on your leg.
- I'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.
Timetable updated.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
Is there a problem?
- No.
"- Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
This drilling is driving me nuts.
I wanna find David and Meredith.
You sure no one else could be in here?
- What?
- Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
- Think they got what they came for?
- Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Think of island white as, um..."
Heroin on steroids.
Okay.
The bidding for U.S. distribution has now started.
"Ricardo Stancati, you're the casino's high roller."
You bid first.
What's your offer?
Charlie.
Angels have landed.
I've notified the Bahamian police.
"They're en route, but they're at least an hour away."
"From the satellite feed of the island,"
I've identified eight armed personnel.
Use extreme caution.
You need to find Bosley and Amanda.
"We won't let you down, Charlie."
"- Good luck, angels."
"- Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Come on.
Nice house.
Being a bad guy certainly has its perks.
I spot one guard.
There could be more inside.
Let's go say hello.
"Well, here it is."
"What's the matter, Mr. Stancati?"
Make an offer.
That's why you're here.
Maybe his employers can't afford to pay.
I don't have that problem.
"There are other influential people, why don't you go to them?"
For example...
-For example...
-No need.
"Look, doctor, you are a completely ordinary, insignificant man."
-Congratulations.
-You don't lie.
And this is exactly what we need.
"We need a background, a guide, who will help us understand matters on Earth."
I must go to work.
Pardon.
"What is ""work""?"
Work...
Work is the meaning of life.
And what is the meaning of life?
Meaning...
I will explain it to you when I get back from work.
-You mustn't snap.
"-And what is ""snap""?"
Such big gaps in knowledge...
"Snap, is like..."
It is like...
I have it!
It was those from the eighth floor.
"When I catch them, I will really catch them!"

"Good morning, Jerry."
Some things in people's homes ring continuously.
And some don't.
- Because two words.
Bloody Mary.
"That's just an urban legend though, right?"
- Of course it isn't.
- Shadows have power you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen.
Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things.
Weren't you supposed to go pull files or something?
Thank you.
- And pull anything from Studio 54.
- Got it.
- 54.
- Heard you.
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Sure.
"- I haven't lost a penny, Mom."
- Myka with you?
"No, she's downstairs on the Whitmans."
I'm getting ready to search their room.
What's up?
How's your radar?
You mean am I having a vibe or something?
Give it a second.
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Anything at all.
- With Myka?
With anything.
"You know, now that you mention it, there is something."
- What?
- The buffet is overpriced.
- Other than that?
- Nope.
No vibe.
To write me an introduction or two.
You're not exactly inspiring me to send you away.
"What if I offered to stay here at the castle,"
"Even if I were married,"
At your beck and call?
You'd have diane.
"I'd have my station,"
My position.
Find me a rich noble
"Who treats me right,"
"And I'll treat you right, as well."
You've learned many skills at court.
Teach me more.
One suitor a week until I choose.
Agreed?
Agreed.
No.
No more.
I'm in charge now.
Have you found my mother?
"I need her now, more than ever."
They said she's with the king.
Trying to wring more out of henry
"Before I'm married to anyone, no doubt."
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?
No.
Francis?
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?
What an eventful day.
"Francis's return,"
- How long has it been since you saw them?
Almost four years.
A beer?
"- No, I have to...."
- All the others went into town.
"A beer in the canteen, just the two of us."
Is that a date?
We can call it that if it helps.
- It helps.
- Good.
Cheers!
Thank you guys.
"Didn't think we'd let you get away that easily, did you?"
Skinnarland sends his love.
Apparently they're in trouble with the police chief who's threatening to blow their covers.
So you are going to be very busy.
Keep your backs straight.
One-two-three...
Good.
Thanks.
- Einar reports good weather in the area.
- Good.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
The war should be over in a couple of months.
I might pop over and see you myself.
"- Good luck, Tronstad."
- Thank you.
Well...
See you soon.
Good luck.
Leif Tronstad never reunited with his family.
These frightened people to scared to live
But why is it that it is the women who is beaten and tied?
Is there not enough of that in reality?
Plenty of men like being beaten and tied
If it makes people happy is it bad?
I saw your friend Julia being arrested
It's finished except for one thing
I need another figure
Is Paul around?
Paul
Stand next to Julia
Wonderful
My legs are longer than that
My bum is too big
My breasts are a bit small
Mine are too big
My bum is not that shape and the're a different size
What is that bush between my legs?
Near Nagerkoil...
"Hey, I'm driving!"
(Song playing)
Don't be mean.
A kiss is all I asked.
No way.
"Hey, please!"
Just one kiss...
Like this.
I Promise.
- Fraudster
What do you call this?
That was just rehearsal.
You have to go.
- Turn around!
You won't hurt him.
You can't.
"- Thank you for teaching me the meaning of pain, Nurse Oaks."
Glad I could return the favour.
- Isabel.
That was quite a performance.
- Hmm.
"- Do you know Hawthorne's ""The Gray Champion""?"
- Yes.
It's the story of a legendary warrior who comes to the aid of those oppressed by tyranny and injustice.
- Yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
This is your finest performance yet.
You... you are The Gray Champion.
- I am The Gray Champion?
"- Yes, this fine institution of..."
"of healing has been overrun with decadence and filth, and... like an avenging angel, you have purified it."
Don't you see?
- This is still part of my treatment.
"- Yes, exactly."
Exactly.
This is all part of my plan.
You and I have purified Rosewood.
Now... you're finally home.
Isabel.
"Isabel, you're healed."
- I'm healed?
- Yes.
Yes.
I found about the courier by hacking into
My father's computer a couple of days ago.
When?
Two days ago.
Then I called you.
When did you hack into his computer?
Sydney.
Two days ago.
Everything I'm telling you
"Is the truth, I swear."
So your father's still alive?
Yes.
And I would do anything
To bring him down.
"(courier:)this is not my fault, da veiga."
You saw me.
I followed instructions.
Somebody compromised our security.
"What, you going to tell the council?"
Obviously one of our dikes needs plugging.
Did you get a good look at
The person with fox and bailey?
I could pick him out a line-up.
Do you want me to go track them down?
[gun shots]
No.
Thank you.
You know what this means?
"Yeah, we're in it up to our eyeballs."
Karen was right.
(syd:)it was coincidence.
(nigel:) was it?
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master DeIacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(men laugh)
only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
- (baby screams) - (Liszt groans)
"George has gone off, it seems."
- shall we go and look for her?
- Can you walk?
Not presently.
I must look like I was attacked by wolves.
"I apologize, I didn't even notice."
"Mmm, uh..."
Could you excuse me while I go to the ladies' room
- for a minute?
"- Sure, sure."
Do you enjoy dancing?
I used to love to dance with my father.
You?
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Watching?
- Pairs...
It's interesting how coupling appears in nature and in mathematics.
- You were talking about pairs...
- The twin-prime conjecture.
"It explores pairs of prime numbers, numbers that are only divisible by themselves."
Three-five.
Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That's right.
"Then you have 11-13, and 17-19 and so on."
It was discovered that pairs were often separated by...
One number in between.
Exactly.
Did you read my book?
"- No, I'm sorry."
- That's all right.
This is really marvelous.
Help!
- Guerrilleros!
"- Get over there, everybody!"
Block that side!
Take cover!
That bastard won't get away from me.
Hurry up!
Take off!
Enrique!
They're trying to get away in their copters.
We might still get them.
- Why are they shooting?
"- We're safe, Padre."
We're safe.
A new magazine.
Try to get into the hospital.
"Shit, we're trapped!"
"Concepción and the others, where are they?"
They're... they're dead.
"Come on, hurry up!"
I think they're all gone.
Enrique!
They nearly killed me.
That priest over there saved my life.
"Come on, we must flee before they come back and kill us all."
You are Enrique Carrasco?
You have to stop this madness.
"Hey, that doesn't look good."
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
"- Héctor, the lorries."
- Get these people to safety.
"When the militia return, they'll kill you all."
"And eww, why're you so dramatic?"
My hit points are going down
Sent!
What'd you send?
A picture of Lin getting excited about this gross room
"It's gross, isn't it?"
Yeah
But... awesome!
Thank you
"Kidding, I'm about to puke"
Big Sis...
Obviously I'm kidding.
Otherwise it'd just be offensive
"Anyways, love what you've done with the place"
Now it's not sad!
"The bathtub is pretty cool, too"
Really?
Can I take a look?
Of course.
This way
"Lin, come too"
Ok.
Can I take pics?
Sure
Holy crap!
Gross!
I didn't do anything with my life
That hunting today got me thinking
"When I was younger, I just watched anime or went to brothels and forgot about it"
"Ignoring the root of the problem, I was satisfied with immediate pleasure"
Youth is a crime
"No, I am full of potential"
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
"She may know much, if properly motivated."
"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We've hit stone!
Clear it off.
"Come on, find the edges."
"Good, good, good."
"You see, Indy?"
You see?
"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
"As a team, boys!"
As a team!
Push!
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.
"Good, good, that's it."
Watch your toes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"Sorry, Indy."
Indy... why does the floor move?
(PANTING)
Christina!
Christina!
"(STRUGGLING) Tris, help me."
Tris!
(CHRISTINA PANTING)
It's okay.
We removed this from the body of the suicide.
Marlene.
Her name was Marlene.
I'm sorry.
Marlene.
It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.
It also has a radio transmitter in its head.
How do we get them out?
I don't know.
This tech was built to defend itself.
This tendril wraps around the nearest major artery.
Try to remove them and they kill the host.
(ALL MURMURING)
CHRISTINA:
So what do we do?
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else.
EDGAR:
Or we could do the logical thing.
And we hand her over.
Nobody knows about this alliance.
We have to protect that advantage.
"If we hand Tris over now, might buy us some time."
(ALL AGREEING)
FOUR:
I think it's a good idea.
A place to return to.
"""I'm home."""
"Yes, ""I'm home."""
Welcome home.
Two days ago we got a transfer request.
A graduate of the shaolin school of martial Arts.
currently a member of the lacrosse team.
The team requested permission to join the league.
apparently they have a new coach.
The beach volley team requests permission for an overseas tour.
Destination:
Australia.
First kneel down.
Hold the stick at an angle of 45to your body.
"Then, with one smooth movement..."
Don't rely just on force.
flow like water.
"Rin, this is fun!"
These are the basics of Shaolin Kung Fu.
Come for a sec.
What?
Standing Zen!
Don't do anything.
Alright!
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force ejects the ball like a bullet.
The lower body is also important.
Its muscles control the speed.
This is Kung Fu.
"Alright, Minmin."
Give it a try.
OK.
"Our message is about peace, love and universal harmony."
Loser!
And about finding balance and cosmic energy through Zenovation.
- Open up your minds to a new reality.
- Losers!
- Screw harmony and peace.
- And that chi stuff.
This is just too easy.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
"And the pictures of the kids, your family, nice people."
"Hey, mind if I wear this?"
You got any tickets to the policemen ball?
"Well, guys, you ready?"
Okay.
- We're back.
- We're back.
What happened yesterday was our fault.
- Un-American.
- Un-Pennsylvanian.
- Un-Charlestownonian.
- Un-Hansonian.
This town needs a good punch in the nose.
- A kick in the teeth.
- A jab in the spleen.
Bernie's hitting us below the belt.
"Fellas, we're here to show you how to help fight back."
- And we have reinforcements.
"- Guys, come on in."
These are our boys.
Dit.
(sighs)
"Well, unexplained things, secrets, occurrences that we're really not supposed to talk about?"
Oh.
Well...
"I believe that there are moments, experiences that someone like McGee, with his trusty computer, couldn't justify."
"When Gibbs left tonight,"
I... thought I saw it again.
Saw what?
The bounce.
"You know, I've been thinking about that."
Boss don't bounce.
"You cannot expect a person to keep things bottled up inside forever, can you?"
RYAN:
"Mm, charades."
Let's play.
Now?
(snorts)
It's as good a time as any.
(chuckles)
No.
Why not?
"Because I don't play games, Doc."
(laughs)
Like hell you don't.
"You know, people keep looking at their watch, usually means they're worried about something."
You got to run?
"Oh, I've been running."
Maybe it's time you stopped?
I wish I could.
You can.
Parker can.
You have no idea.
And entered your hot and wet vagina.
Your cherished sexy lips of ardent lust and desire.
And so flush in the springtime of your passion.
Can you feel my cock as your clitoris between your fingers?
"Every stroke of yours, it gets bigger and harder."
"Feel it, love, are you coming?"
"Respond, Rosella, tell me that you can feel it."
"Yes, I am sorry!"
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Slowly!
Gently!
I can't take any more.
No!
Come slowly too.
"Gently, slowly."
What dominating fingers you have!
It makes me crazy.
"Yes, like that, penetrate my yoni, please."
I love you deep iside.
"Take my bushy cunt, I beg you."
Don't stop.
More cock inside.
Stronger please.
Take it.
"Push it, we are getting there, forcefully."
"Yes, that's good."
We are coming together.
"Yes, that's it!"
"More, keep it going!"
"Squeeze my balls, my darling."
That feels so good!
Coffee.
Same here.
And two glasses of water.
"It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious."
I saw the film.
And?
Nothing.
Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.
So people know how desperate the situation is.
It's exceptional.
I didn't say I don't agree.
I totally do.
You live with Jean-René?
A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre.
With members of the collective.
The film you made in Italy...
Is it finished?
We're still debating.
Comrades find it politically questionable.
It's tense but fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.
We have an office.
"I answer the phone, tend to the prints."
It keeps me busy.
I want to go to college but I missed registration.
I may go to London.
To be a gofer on a film.
It may not work out.
What film?
Nothing like yours.
Go on.
Science fiction.
- No.
No.
- You were?
- I have no alarm triggered.
"Minds, motherfucker!"
"Easy, easy."
Enough!
- It 's okay.
- Phooey!
"- Come, go."
"- You're lucky, you bastard!"
Let's go!
Where would you get you parked your Prius?
What the hell is that?
If the cops keep coming for November we need it.
It displays up!
Give it up.
Avoid all main roads.
Shit!
You'll be fine.
All right?
N-one to hurt anyone.
TIME AND SITE

- Sounds like van Hall.

Room two is not working.
They used to cover the van door as a.
They poured all over the organic solvent.

Alarm was triggered both a Cabin number two by Deputy Director at Beth Israel.

Everybody was there.

We won't keep you from your work...
I'm sure it's very important.
"Come on, Paul, I wanna go home."
"Jocelyn, don't work too late, will you?"
You are pathetic!
What a disgrace!

The new muse!
I know her wicked ways
The parts you never see

To abandon my station
You shouldn't be in here

"- No, my brother's"
Here

Your ex's?
They were my mother's
Turn around
That stuff really worked.
The pain has gone completely
"OK, you can turn around"
"It suits me, doesn't it?"
Are you closed?
The power is down.
What else can I do?
So you're hitting the bottle?
Look familiar?
He attacked your waitress

No idea I have a lot of customers
Put it up inside

- Ifyou like
You're very welcome
"God bless einstein,"
But i had to boost his theory just a little.
Case in point.
"Well, look like i won't be using that tesseracter."
This is confusing for me.
"So much about me was lost,"
So much forgotten.
"Well, then, why don't you tell me"
What you do remember?
"I remember it made me happy to be here,"
"On this ship,"
With you.
"On the other hand,"
"Andromeda, rommie, doyle... i don't even know what to call myself."
I'll tell you what.
Why don't i just call you... friend.
[Footsteps]
Shall we paddle?
I'd rather not.
I'm going to.
Oh!

Is it cold?
"Hey, Ursula, stop it!"
Oh!

"No, please, I beg you, don't."
[Man on radio]:

"South-to-southwest gales spreading from the west, with rain and moderate or poor visibility."
Storms are imminent.
Yihong Brothel?
I must get that ill-gotten money
Have some tea!
"My lord, aren't you wasting this good wine?"
What a pity?
Not at all!
Nothing like Chinese dates soaked in wine
It's like paradise!
Such a big man and he's still sucking breasts
Looks like it's so pleasurable
Heavenly!
Look at the way he waggles his tongue
This is so embarrassing
What's so embarrassing about that?
Don't come if you're broke
This is so wonderful!
"Master Zhou, you've had your pleasure!"
"Let's play the money game, how's that?"
Good!
Come!
Come!
All of you!
Let's get everybody out!
These are all for you!
Coming!
Coming!

Let's start the game!
You can have it if you get it
"If you drop it, it's not yours!"
You dropped it!
Stupid!
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just want...
You just want to be free.
Exactly.
Hmm.
Thank you.
Isabel.
Roderick.
My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
And how is the famous doctor?
The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
I'm sorry.
"Dr. cairn says it's a part of the healing process, a side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Whoareyou?
I'mEdith.

"This is your Gold Rush girl, Marissa Kessler, wishing everyone a lucky lotto day."
Somebody help me!
Help!
Help me!
No!
No!
No!
"Don't, please!"
Don't!
It's a jungle out there
Disorder and confusion everywhere
No one seems to care
"Well, I do"
"Hey, who's in charge here?"
It's a jungle out there
Poison in the very air we breathe
You know what's in the water that you drink?
"Well, I do"
It's amazing
People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time
"If you paid attention, you'd be worried, too"
You better pay attention
Or this world we love so much might just kill you
I could be wrong now
But I don't think so
"Get out, sinister one!"
"Get out, terrible one!"
Away with you!
Away!
Get away!
Away!
Don't touch me!
- Go away!
Away!
Die!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Have pity, dark one..."
"Look, isn't that the one who put your viola out of tune?"
There she is!
There she is!
You yourself are a devil's servant!
Profanity comes from your lips!
"Die, crumble away!"
Crumble away like ashes in the desert!
You are a devil with a tail and hair.
"Sisters, tear off his clothes!"
Trample him down!
Trample him down!
This woman is guilty of carnal intercourse with the Devil.
She is subject to the judgment of the inquisition.
She shall be tortured and then burned at the stake.

"Love is like a net, capturing heroes' hearts"
"Like a sword, vengeance cutting through love and hate"
What did you think of yourself?
Angel?
I lifted them for your sake.
"Now you can marry her, or just keep her."
Brother!
What's this you have done?
You have crossed all limits.
You showed your standings.
"You have misunderstood me, Sheen."
Stop your performance.
What did you think?
You will gain me like this?
"Faiz, this was a big mistake by you."
Victory is not in forcing.
Victory is in defeating hate.
Well!
You and your brother won't understand this.
These are professional killers.
Might have lifted up even the women your family.
Be in your limits and speak!
You speak badly about our women?
"Step away, brother!"
Move!
What are you doing?
What are you all doing?
Leave me.
I will shoot her.
"Making fusses, bloody!"
"What else can be expected of you, Impotent?"
"Stop it, girl!"
You call us Impotent?
Shall I show you our manhood?
- I have to finish here first.
- It's OK.
I can come back later.
- Selfish bastard!
- Cunt!
- Your costumes are just magnifique.
- Thank you.
"You can come a long way in France, with the right support."
"I feel I see who you are and what you need, you know?"
- I'm not quite sure I do.
- I could make you very successful.
- A very happy woman.
"- Thanks, but I'm doing fine."
I think you should start trusting your feelings.
Like we do in Paris.
What feelings?
You don't know who I am!
You cunt!
You loser...
Merde!

I thought we'd talked about you using my bathrobe.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't.
- If you insist.

Sit down!
- You can keep it on for now.
"- Sit down, please."
Sit down.

It's eight hours until dark and what is it?
Four shot balls left.
"Eight hours, four shot balls, not the most encouraging number."
"Besides, they're not going to let us live until dark."

The other two got away.
They got andreas.

He will be back with a vengeance.
Where will they take andreas?
To the darkest place on earth.
I have to go after them.
(nigel:)let's see what we've got here.
The scabbard has holes along its length
That coincide with words written
On the inside of the blade.
Makes up a latin phrase.
"""from sarsen stone, 240 peds,"
"Beneath the druid's noch."""
"(syd:) ""peds."""
Is a roman measurement common to the time.
"Yeah, the stride of an average man."
It would have been about
Five-foot-two in those days.
Sarsen.
"Sarsen is a type of limestone,"
Indigenous to south- central England.
"Also known as greywether,"
Or druidstone.
It's what stonehenge is made of.
- [bleats]
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
- Want me to tell you how safe?
- [Alfred bleating]
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month,"
They're gonna give me a gold safety award.
- What do you think of that?
- [bleating]
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
- I sure hope you're a good tipper.
- [bleats]
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
[tires screeching]
[cabbie] hey!
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
[cabbie sighs]
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh...
Record.
You're the murderer the whole empire is out looking for!
"Well, then."
I will go and prepare your dinner now.
The count was really depressed.
Do you suppose he feels responsible?
Is this really a good idea?
Is what?
"Well, the count, he most likely thinks of her as-"
"Yes, he seems to like her!"
And you don't care?
!
Is there something wrong with that?
Asta-san!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
I should've minded my own business!
Your Lordship?
Where are you going?
To find Radu.
You mustn't!
"Out of my way, Terran!"
Why are you so adamant?
!
Eh?
Is there something wrong with me finding Radu and keeping him from assassinating Her Majesty?
!
Your Lordship!
Are you suggesting I want the empress to be assassinated?
!
I'm just...
"I'm just some deplorable, blood-starved monster to you, anyway!"
That's not true!
"- You make up for that, then!"
-
- Hmm?
-
- Don't know what you mean.
-
- Listening to the gossip!
I can't help overhearing a certain amount.
Over--over--overhearing?
!
Your lugs were f--flapping about like radar!
There was me with me arms windmilling about trying to persuade you to m--make a sale.
"Oh, is that what you were doing?"
Making a sail for your windmill.
A sail for your w...
Aghh!
Ow!
-
"- Now, you're g--g--going to get on with it."
-
- What are you doing with that lad's ear?
It's the only place to handle s--small dogs and errand boys.
"With due regard to the conventions, where else would I take hold of an errand boy?"
Poor lad!
You've made it all red.
-
- It feels longer.
Is it longer?
-
- You leave him alone.
"He's got very shapely, delicate, small ears."
"""Delicate""?"
I'm upset with myself.
I live in my fantasies.
"When reality knocks, I don't open."
He tell you?
Briefly.
No need for more.
It would be dangerous.
For you and us.
I thought it over.
You're partially right.
Militancy is getting us nowhere.
Bourgeoise elections even less.
It's a trap.
It's time for action.
No revolution ever avoided it.
French resistance took up arms.
We extol their heroism.
We're the new resistance.
Don't Maoists say that?
Maybe they're right.
So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.
Where do you position yourself?
Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it?
It's easy.
The car comes.
The comrades change vehicles.
Set theirs on fire in the woods.
He'll take you back by motorcycle.

- It's not our call.
"We chose the underground, and its rules."

Do not know why I forgot ‎.‎.‎.
Remember that‎.
Or send us all to hell along with you‎.

- Got it‎?

"- Yes‎, Sergeant‎."
Sometimes I wonder what happens to you‎.
"You do not have to ask more‎, it has been confirmed‎."

Just a little tired‎.
"Then‎, ‎.‎.‎."

It's a long story‎.

Yes.

Yes.
"Duplicate pieces that the Cairo Museum feel they can spare will, of course, be ceded to you."

I will do everything in my power to make sure that you receive a fair selection.
My husband would have wanted you to return to your work.
Will Mr Mace be returning to Egypt?
"I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
Mace died recently.
"Oh, dear."
I'm so sorry.
I expect the newspapers will say he is another victim of the curse of Tutankhamun.
Arthur always laughed at the idea.
There are times when I wonder.

(Speaking Arabic)
Lift.
Stop.
Stop!
"You, stop."
"You, stop."
"You, lift."
"You, start."
Everyone.
That's good.
Very nice.
Good.
"Okay, let's get the planks in."
Planks in.
Good.

- When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.
- Everybody.
On my count.

- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended.

I need a Yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
"All right, amp of epi."
Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
...if it'd be easier for you.
I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to.
Because it's all right here.
"Welcome back, Elizabeth."
Do you have time for a consult?
"As it turns out, yes."
What's he have?
Belly pain?
Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.

"- Yeah, it's quite hot in here."

Um... hi.
"I wonder if you could help us, please."
We're looking for a...

I just picked up our little man and thought we'd drop by for a visit.
I've been trying to get Fen interested in food.
She shows a passing interest in oatmeal.
- (Fen grunting) - (Murdoch):
Any other changes?
"She's still making the gestures, but I haven't been able to decipher any pattern."
It certainly doesn't match any sign language that I can find.
(Murdoch):
Perhaps it is just random.
- (baby babbling)
"- Hello, Roland."
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)
- Oh!
- The nanny says that
- we are to feed him more often.
- Hahaha!
"- He's hardly underfed, William."
"- I agree, but she insists."
There.
No?
"See, you're not even hungry."
(Fen grunting)
"Do you see that, William?"
(Fen grunting)
You like the baby?
- You want to see the baby?
- (Fen grunting)
"I think she's more interested in you, William."
Pa!
- She's speaking.
- Paaa!
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean, maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
Doc.
Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean, Lex Luthor."
Case in point.
"Hey, psycho."
"Hey, psycho."
What's up?
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.
I got nine lives.
Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh, right."
"Well, uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or Bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.
But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.
Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah, most of these whack jobs add ball bearings, nails, whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.
"You mind if I, uh..."
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
Wait a bit.
- How much do you charge?
- Let go of me!
Fuck.
- That's what I'm asking about.
- Go eat shit.
Alright.
- So what are you doing right now?
"- Nothing, nothing."
There's some boys that need a medic.
- Come with me.
- I didn't finish my studies.
"If you don't say anything then I won't either, alright?"
Come.
- Jimmy!
- I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop along the way.
Pasqualino's coming too.
Let's go!
"As you can see, the interior of Vesuvius isn't dormant."
"And examining the seismographs, we can see that activity... has increased in recent weeks."
- Does that always happen?
- Absolutely not.
This is the first time I see this phenomenon.
- Strange...
- Yes.
"Maria, we..."
"Excuse me, one moment."
Maria!
Where are you going?
What about the picnic?
Tell my father we're going to see the nuns.
I know that crowd.
Watch out or they'll get him into trouble.
You understand?
"Tomorrow evening, you say?"
Is Biberkopf really coming with us?
Of course.
Why not?
"One bale of cheviot, 75.29."
"One half bale of worsted, 75.64."
"One bale of cheviot, 75.66."
- How many bales are missing in total?
- Just a moment.
"My wife said just yesterday, ""No one can get through that door!"""
So they came through the roof!

These men clearly have no sense of patriotism!
The very best English cloth!
The very best English cloth.
"I certainly hope so, or I'm conning myself."
That tickles!
No nonsense!
I'll send for my old things later.
"Mieze, come and be amazed."
What do you think?
- Very smart!
Clothes make the man.
Now it's your turn.
No!
Don't be so silly!
Business is good.
We can afford decent clothes now.
Right?
- Welcome home
- Thanks
What's that?
It was just lying there
Someone was in a hurry
"I'm home, baby"

"He'll be fine, it's the third time And the sword's bamboo"
He tries to commit hara-kiri every spring

Was also delicious.

What the hell?

And that's why no one is leaving MasterChef.
Wow.

"Congratulations for bringing top-level technique, restaurant-quality souffles."
Thank you.

I was offering her a chance to earn some extra money in our substation
It's no big deal
I know you Japanese policemen too well

You deserve it!

Who knows?
"Had any meat, my boy?"
Have a drink!

Father!
"Father, can we slaughter a cow?"
Not enough to eat?
"It's enough, but we haven't had beef for such a long time"
Do it then
Let's slaughter a cow!
Hooray!
She's locked me out of the system.
"I can override her manually, but I need that control panel."

Okay.
Unauthorized entry.
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.
Do you think we are all created for a purpose?
I'd like to think so.
Denser alloy.
My father gave it to me.
I think he wanted me to kill you.
Security breached.
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.
-What if we didn't have six minutes?
-We'd have to climb down 30 stories to inject the nanites directly into her brain.
Why?
Because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes.
We gotta go!
Go!

Save her!
Save the girl!

But I must apply the nanites!

You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.
You have so got to die.

"This full moon, this water, the shadows..."
"Jilaan, Saiba, such love..."

Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.
Here..
I die for you.
No!
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"'Bodies meet, bodies perish.'"
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Saiba was never yours and shall never be.
Nature shall repeat this story.
Today love has bled into water.
Then there's no lover greater than me.
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
'Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.'
"'No trust, no love.'"
'Here...
I die for you.'
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Karma.
Things come back to you.
They repeat.
What had happened will repeat.
"Only you can change it, Saira."
You were mine and shall always remain mine.

"Oh, Bruiser!"
Bruiser!
Fighters... set to.
Regency boxing predated today's Queensberry rules.
"Come on, Mr. Dean!"
"Come on, Bruiser!"
It combined punching with wrestling and was always bareknuckle.
Who wants to back the favorite?
Who's going to show first blood?
First blood!
First blood!
Time!
Rounds continued until one man hit the ground.
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Here they come.

Bruiser!
Round 16.
Come on!
Come on!

And he dumped me in boarding school.

"Well, now taken literally,"
What's written on there
"Doesn't make any sense,"
The words are all jumbled up
And in no particular order.

None like I've ever seen.
Look at this.
"Marks on the blade,"
Like grooves over the words.
As if something's been repeatedly
"Moved back and forth,"
Like a scabbard.

"Excuse me, but who are you?"
"- ""Introductions by Elise."""
Introduction...?
Intro...
Oh.
"- Oh, you're a dating service."
- Executive matchmaker.
Oh.
And a very large contributor.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase:
"You are the 200-pound tuna of bachelors, senator."
"You really don't have time to separate the wheat from the chaff,"
Grace Kellys from the Britney Spears.
That's where I come in.
- We need to meet the governor.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Lovely to meet you.
Think about it.
- You bet.
- Give me that.
- You didn't find her persuasive?
No.
"Objectifying, pushy, judgmental?"
"Yes, definitely."
She is trying to bring people together.
That is noble work.
- She looked at you like meat.
"- Tuna, actually."
If the press ever got wind of you using a madam...
- Matchmaker.
- They're gonna have a field day.
Can you think of a less romantic way to meet someone?
I will destroy the jedi.
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
You are no longer my apprentice.
And now you shall die.
"Thank you, Artoo."
That's quite enough.
"Ventress, you're not looking well."
She never does.
"You have failed, Ventress, surrender."
Never.

Ventress is battling the jedi on board the command ship.
Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire.
"But, my lord,"
"I calculate that will destroy, Ventress, the jedi, and all our forces."
Precisely.

- Open fire.
That is correct.
Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar.
It's over.
"Anakin, look out!"
We have to get out of here.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

You will fall in love eventually.
Anyway...
The only one...
I am the only one you can love.
Not even a kiss for your fiancé?

You established an outpost in our space.
You butchered helpless human beings.
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you.
Can that be true?
Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space?
"It may well be possible, doctor."
We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
Then we could be in the wrong.
Perhaps.

Never mind about me.

You better stay here and keep an eye on things:

Let's go:
Where to now?
I don't know:
Looks like we struck a dead end:
Colonel Deering:
Captain Rogers:!
I just searched the supply room:
It was Reardon:
He changed himself to look like Parsons:
It's locked:
Stand back:
"Reardon, we know you're in here:"
You might as well show yourself and surrender:
"Hawk, you see anything?"
"Nothing, Buck:"
It appears as though Reardon has left the reactor room:
- But how?
- Perhaps through another door:
"What do you mean, another door?"
You know as well as I do there's only one way out of this reactor room:
Buck?
Where's that detonator?

Because he's a giver.
"Do you watch ""The Voice?"" He really, like, is into, I think he might give just the right amount."
"Like, not Sting give, but--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I would do what I had to do to meet that cat.
That white cat he holds on that show.
BETH HOYT:
That's what he's saying.
What?
What the f did I tell you?
The bandaid on the back of your neck?
The briefcase.
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
MALE SPEAKER:
"Oh, jeez."
Just another day at the office.
-I told you Porno Pictionary was the way to go.
"-Hey, why don't we kick it up a notch and make this into a swingers party?"
"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

"Let's say, right now."
Have you ever been to
California?

There was one last night too.
"It's So it, so it just ended?"
It just happened right now?
Yeah.
"Just now. ,, , What part of California do you live in?"
Los Angeles What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh yeah, I see where it came from."
I'm just looking at the epicenter.
Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."

Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.

"Alright, here we go."

"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.

Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
"Yes, what does it mean?"
How much is this?
Correct.
"Hey guys, let's eat a snack."
What is this?
"Hey, what's the use in knowing that?"
The No Ri that we love
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"
"Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged."
Thank you.
"Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me."
Okay.
"If there's something you don't know, always call me."
"You know my phone number, right?"
"Yes, I will."
"No Ri, get healed quickly."
"Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem."
"No Ri,"
"All Rio has to do is get his victim safely to shore, grab the flag, and he wins."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Make sure not to let my head go under in case he went under."
I wanted to see where he was at all times.
Stay calm.
I'm here to rescue you.
You're going to be okay.
I got you.
"Just try to kick with me, all right?"
I'm swimming for the finish line.
That's when I see Paul.
Paul:
"I get to the bridge, I look out in the lake,"
I see two swamped canoes and some guy in the middle of the lake splashing around.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" We're almost there, okay?"
Paul:
Calm!
Stay calm!
Everything's coming back to me from my Life Saving merit badge.
Get the person calm in the water before you approach him.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I got him to the shore."
I pulled him out of the water.
You okay?
"All right, you'll be all right, man."

"Hey, man, you get the flag."
Teenager #14:

Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
Judging from that Yello Robe fellow's expressions... he must have wicked plans for Wanqing &amp;amp; Master Tuan.
No
I must try to inform the Tuan family first.
"Go, little snake."
Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."
I said stay there.
You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?
- You're a liar.
She's not coming back.
- I promise she is.
I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Stop, please!"
Where are you?
I don't want to see her die again!
"Please, I beg you."
Help me.
Please.
This is yours.
"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
- May God give you more.
Afiyet olsun.
"Mehmet, where's our tea?"
"Just kidding, sit down."
Eat your food.
It's Memo's day today.
"Eat all you can, Memo."
That's what I call a börek... ... health be upon your mother's hands.
Eat from that çörek as well.
It's the çörek my dad sells the most.
- I already ate 3 of those.
- Whoa!
"Mmm, this one is delicious as well."
This doesn't look like bakery material tho.
Where is this from?
From a certain çirkin.
"Guys, your letters."
"Good news, we got our letters"

How are you Mahir?
I'll go prepare her food before she comes.
She didn't look tired at all.
She was outside all day.
She went to the jail with Sami Amca.
- Jail?
"- Well, I was there as well."
That's how I saw her.
- Good evening.
"- Good evening, how can I help you?"
- Gülten Hanım?
"- Yes, it is me."
"I am Münir Erkut, lawyer."
I told Barış all I had to say.
I don't want anything from him.
I have no demands.
All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not an attorney to the person you mentioned.
I am Kazım Gencerel's lawyer.
My condolences.
I had not told my daughter about it.
My condolences.
Your father wanted me to give you something.
Please come inside.
Gülten Hanım...

Please grant my son his life!
Please let my son live.
Take my life instead.
"Renu, I have good news for you."
Hello!
Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.
Hospital!
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.
A bullet hit his shoulder and now it's out.
He'll be dancing within a week.
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj.
God heard my prayers.
This means that our hero is perfectly all right.
He is no ordinary hero.
His plane caught fire and it crashed.
He landed with his parachute right in the midst of the enemy.
He was 20 miles away from our side... ... and he came back avoiding the shower of bullets.
Can we meet Suraj?
The visiting hours are from 4 to 6.
You can meet him then.
Goodbye!
"Come, aunty."
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.
"Hello, aunty!"
Are you all right?
- Perfect!
Otherwise I have no hope.

We're encouraging everyone to chant Hare Krishna mantra
"Q: yet we're seeing now there's one quote in Padma-purana, the sa that same, without proper initiation, the mantra received is wihout effect."
So is it that those without proper connection they're not getting any benefit from chanting the mantra?

Q2:

Proper progress.
"There maybe something like [unna??], [backward??] marriage?"
"Like [budwa??] activating and sadure, abruptly it may become or may not namabhas."
I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!

Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!

Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."

You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"

I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.

This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
We will see him together.

He will be here soon.

"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.

You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.

"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."
"And the secret of his long life was that.. ..he was a bachelor like me. sir, you should count a person""s real age after his marriage."
You are right!
You are an interesting man!
"Yes, sir! sir, shall I come with you?"
"No! lf you want, you can go and.."
"Yes, sir!"
Now it is too late!
Did you patch up with your beloved?
That is not a problem.
"But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss!"
"Boss, give me such an idea.. such an idea.."
That he stops interfering!
"Yes, boss!"
He should be completely defeated!
What does her father wants?
We got experience
New coaches new teachers
Done new events and everything is just is getting better and better
Thats one section
Alright
Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
He has forgotten all of us.
Hatun Abla...
Look...Maybe this baby will be born but...
Mustafa won't even recognize it.
"What kind of husband or man... ...or father he will be, that I don't know, but..."
"If you and the doctor ask and if Narin helps and goes to the hospital to see him,  maybe he will get better."
Stay away from Narin!
Enough of your malice!
Enough!
"Hatun Abla, for every cruelty I did to you... for my every misbehaviour, forgive me!"
Please...
"Look, I will cary you on my back until I die."
I will clean you...
I will be your slave.
"Please, forgive me Hatun Abla."
"Doctor, please help..."
"Look, If you want, I can give you golds I kept at my mom's house."
"Fatma, take me..."
"Hatun Abla, please!"
"Hatun Abla, please forgive me."
Pull yourself together...
Get up...
Please...
Inci Teyze...
Get up my girl...
"Hatun Abla, please..."
Asiye...Pull yourself together...
Maybe you should give her some medicine???
"Not now, mom..."
Let me take you home.
They will be worried.
Who will worry about me?
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
"Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order."
"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."
"Jackie is injured, sir."
He can't go much far.
He must be somewhere nearby.
D'souza!
Wherever he's...
I can't return home until I find him.
You... sir?!
"- Yes, I..."
Now I'll bring Jackie dead.
"""My love, my beloved..."""
"""My darling... my love..."""
"""My darling, my Romeo."""
"""My Romeo... my honey..."""
"""My love..."""
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."""
"""But I'm not destined... for anyone's love in life."""

"""I know..."
I know...
"My love..."""
Say I can't stand being with a guy like him anymore.
But... you want me to say that?
Just help me this once.
I can't say it to him myself.
Mi-ryung asked me to tell you this.
She wants to break up with you.
She can't stand... being with a guy like you any longer.
He's crying.
You can hang up now.
She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.
"Yes, really."
Wait.
Now what?
You said it's finished!
Thank you so much.
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?
Don't bother.
We're over
Separation Agency
"For people who are hesitant about breaking up, or for those who have trouble saying the words,"
"I will... no, we will do it for you."
Separation Agency.
I wish it would just pour rain and cool things off.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Didn't she come in here just now?
Oh my god!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Damn, why's it so dark?"
Is it on backwards again
Why did you drink so much?
Come to your senses!
Good job.
Go on your way.
Aren't you going to give me some...?
- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
I'll scold him!
"Dalyan, I'm sure one of your men will have a knife."
I want it now.
What will you do?!
I want it now.
Don't waste time.
I can be thrown in solitary confinement anytime now!!
Dalyan...
Stab me!
My soul is burning when firing the trigger...
That look of yours... saying 'Don't forget me!'...
It marked my betrayal on my forehead.
Lan...
"Come on then, shoot...Shoot!"
I have no one left.
Shoot!
"C'mon, shoot!...Shoot..."
Shoot!
"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."
"Ibo, there is no return from here, son!"
"You will never forget that i pointed a gun at you, Lan!"
"And i can't live in fear, Lan."
"Stop it, stop it...I will redeem myself to you...Please don't do this!"
Come on stand up.
Don't let your last words be begging ones.
Who saidI asked you?!
Why are you doing this?
I'm talking to youI failed...
Why are you doing this?
I'm telling you I'm not betraying you!
I will never do it!
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.
"No, let's take him right in."
( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
"And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice"
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life
[dramatic music playing]
-(reporter) The carnage continues today as yet another body was found.
This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
-(announcer) This summer... get ready... the rivers are gonna run red.
[crash!]
-Ah!
-Oh yeah!
"[muffled yelling, explosion]"
-Knife to meet ya.
-[muffled noises]
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
Can I axe you a question?
-Ah!
-Go!
"Go, he's gaining on us!"
Step on it!
[crash!]
"-I'll teach you to make fun of me, Dane Cook."
Heads up!
-Ah!
lf they had their way they will sell God.
lnternational crook. crook. crook.
lnternational crook.
Bhuta singh!
- Yes!
Do you want to lose your life?
- No!
"lf you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life!"
No!
- Listen!
- Yes!
Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."
"lf you didn""t come out till I count 5.. ..then we will kill the child!"
1 .. 2.. ..3..
No!
Give me my child!
Leave him!
Leave him!
No!
"I won""t let this happen!"
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
(laughs)
"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.
(coughs)
"Good morning, Sweet Valley High."
"Today's top story... 3, 2..."
*♪ I've got some news for you*
*♪ I am the one you need...*
Missing school fund discovered.
After a recent probe into the school department's budget...
Go again.
"OK, take 14! *♪ I've got the perfect story* missing $5,000 fund..."
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
- Where should I put my hands?
- The waist is safest.
You're a quick learner.
"Now, tongues."
They're a health and safety issue.
The secret is to strike the right balance between yielding and giving.
"Start slowly, like a turtle, not a lizard."
Avoid washing machine syndrome.
"Sadly, this session's over."
My next client's here.
"- Hi, Georgia."
"- Hi, El."
"Thank you, Georgia."
I'll be in touch.
"You did tongues, didn't you?"
Number six.
"You did a big fat tongue sandwich, didn't you?"
"Oh, my God."
"All I know is, he was from Saliva City."
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.
Wait!
Mum?
Dad?
I just want you both to know how much I really appreciate all you've done for me.
"I mean, it can't be easy since you can hardly remember being my age"
'cause it was so long ago.
Have you been inhaling fumes from the science lab?
I want to talk party details.
"Oh, Georgia."
I told you I needed to talk about something important.
"Oh, this is important!"
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?
"Life, a penny at a time."
"Oh, love, life a penny at a time."
"Love, life a penny at a time."
"Oh, love."
"[fireworks whistling, popping]"
man speaking native language:
"When I close my eyes,"
"I can see all different people in the world from town to town, from country to country."
"I can feel it, I can touch it, I can see it."
I feel like born again because of my haircut.
It's time to continue my journey.
man:
Who do you love?
Cathy:
"My silly boys, the Bobby-ells."
Okay.
What do you fear? man:
"Well, I guess..."
I'm fearless now.
"I guess my fear was that you'd get cancer, and you did."
"That you'd get it again, I mean."
And you did.
But it's over with.
So I'm fearless.
[haunting music]
[overlapping chatter]
[thunder rumbling]
woman:
No
No one smells anything
I definitely smell a chicken
"Alright, man."
I wanna clean fight Let's get it on
Wait a minute is he gonna use those gloves
What's wrong with my gloves
"Well, won't they get in the way of all the scratching and slapping? *"
You're gonna rock his world.
Punish him.
You're the man
Good luck
Come on.
Stuart
"You're like a wild animal, aren't you"
"Well, how am i supposed to fight you if you keep running around like a sissy?"
A sissy
Yeah
Is he down
How good of a friend is he?
"Actually, we're very tight, but I'm totally ok with you beating the crap out of him."
"Come on ,Dorothy"
Is that all you got? here comes one from macy's basement.
"1,2,3,4....."
Don't sweat this.
Only 14 more rounds to go. here we go!
"How are you doing, Stuart, alright."
How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.
"Thank God, Damodar isn't here today."
"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"
I know Damodar.
He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
"What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?"
"Pretty swanky, are they not?"
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you... ...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
"Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it."
"Oh, and it turned out BEAUTlFUL, don't you think?"
"Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy."
It just sings spring!
"And Pinkie Pie, look!"
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
-They're...
"-Yeah, they're..."
They sure are...
-...sumth'n.
-Yes!
Something.
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Here it is.
That's right.
"This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia."
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
"Here we are at six, which is burned out."
Just your basic Dover elevator.
"For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator."
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right.
Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray:
You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha.
"So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man."
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.
[baby wailing]
"Just bullshit, man."
Alpha male trapped in and locked in through religion and politics.
"Soon enough, man, my plans will all come into perfection."
[celestial choir]
[man snores]
[phone rings]
[toy rattles]
[alarm beeping]
[rooster crows]
It's going to be about German industry norms.
"I wish you good luck, I hope it's going to be perfect!"
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
That was a mistake!
Nobody checks the handicapped sticker.
"Mom, we're just not comfortable with it."
"Yeah, and it's a really expensive ticket, by the way."
"Well, I got a bum knee and a broken vagina."
Ticket that!
(DlNG!
DlNG!
DlNG!)
MOTHER'S DAY
"Good afternoon, welcome to the El Fuerte..."
What's good about it?
Sorry!
It was a long drive.
Ha ha ha!
"Um, we have our registration."
You got room in the trash for Mama?
Unless you want my crust.
"Trust me, you don't want that."
My sister and I are on the list.
"And, um, we have our mom with us today."
Does she have a reservation with us?
I have a reservation about your haircut.
It should be under Turner.
P F-ing U!
Either something died in this...
"Ma, I'll put you back in the car so fast."
Oh G-d!
Look.
What's he doing?
- What..
"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.
- Nah.
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.
It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.

Amy:
Oh no!
DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!

"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""

"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.

"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.

I heard Yoda talking about midichlorians.
I've been wondering... ...what are midichlorians?
It's herion.
"Come on, boy."
We have located the Jedi.
We have them right where we want them.
Good.
This is almost over.
Just remember to keep all of your receipts.
This is a business trip.
Everything we do here is tax deductible.
At last.
I will show the Jedi who is truly lord of the dance. ...conference call to go over our quarterly report.
Maul?
Maul!
Snap out of it.
Are you even listening to me?
Yes.
Business trip.
Pinkie's tail is twitchin'.
What else can I do?
(all laugh)
Twilight:
"""I am happy to report that I now realize there  are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true."
"It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."""
Pinkie Pie:
HONK!
Spike:
"(still writing) ""Honk..."" Twilight:"
"""Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."""
(door opens)
(tail twitches) Pinkie Pie:
There it goes again!
Twilight:
I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky THlS time.
Pinkie Pie:
You never know.
"(window opens, Spike inhales) (approaching jet, Celestia thuds onto balcony)"
Spike:
Twitchy tail?

Episode 12
"Which way do I go? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you go in that direction, you will die.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You shouldn't go there!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
"If you won, our model will won."
"And with it's victory, the company will win."
"Your house will be made, your dream house."
Wow!
What a horoscope!
Planets are very firm at their positions... ...facing some obstacles too... ...which means the girl is very adamant.
- That's right.
She'll do love marriage.
Boy's name will start with J.
That means Jimmy.
- Yes.
"This year, the boy will take part in some air competition... ...and win the first prize."
And he'll earn fame in the world.
He'll be her husband.
Air competition?
"Yes, I remember."
Motor cycle race.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
And there's going to be a motorcycle race.
I stood first in Singapore for consecutive 3 years.
And I'll definitely take part in this race.
"Yes, son and do come first."
This is a question of our reputation.
Yes.
This race is of 30 miles distance from Mumbai to Panvel.
And 21 motorbikes across the world are taking part.
"Number 9, Mr. Jaikishan from Escort."
"Motorbike, Rajdoot 350."
Number 16.
Mr. Jimmy Thapa from Singapore.
Jimmy!

Gold and watches worth lakhs were seized!
"Were any men nabbed? - sir, five!"
Where is the group?
"Why didn""t you bring them here? very sorry, sir."
Presenting corpses is illegal. shut up!
Listen! - sir!
Where was that call from?
"- From Alibagh, sir! shift our headquarters there immediately."
"- Right, sir! very good idea, sir!"
The police should keep a tab on the culprits.
"And the culprits should keep a tab on the police. so that it""s easy for both of them."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir!"
Will you please shut up?
And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!
Gomi!
The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."
Sure.
"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.
"Mom, I'm home !"
[ Chattering ]
[ Moaning ]
[ Moaning Continues ]
"Oh, yeah."
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
I'm sorry that I cannot touch your feet as my arm is wounded.
It's not necessary.
- Why not?
I had left with your blessings so I returned alive.
"No, my son."
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life for their country.
What did aunty say?
I've got it.
Wonderful!
Your words have strengthened my determination.
Do you know what my mother would have said?
"What have you done, my son?"
I told you not to join the defence services.
You are my only son.
"You were saved this time but, what will happen the next time?"
And then she would start crying.
For the sake of her child a mother has to cry sometime.
Some shed tears and some swallow their tears.
"What is the matter, aunty?"
Nothing.
"Aunty, can I ask you something?"
Don't you have any children?
I had a son.
He wasjust like you.
I lost him.
Your mother has come to see you.
"Please send her in, doctor."
I'll leave now.
- Why?
You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.
"Renu, you stay here."
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.
"I-I mean, the scars healed really well."
"- Hey, Stifler."
- Eat shit.
What was that all about ?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that ?
"What do you mean, ""no comment"" ?"
- Did you two hook up or something ?
"- What, are you kidding ?"
No.
Then how did all this get started ?
"Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now."
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
"Cheese, please."
"Finch comes up to me and says, ""Jessica,"
"I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."""
"So I said, ""All right."
"Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."""
"So he did, and I did."
- That actually works ?
"- Well, duh !"
Of course.
"Naturally, I embellished a little bit."
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman ?
[ Chuckling ]
"No, I didn't hear that one."
That one was my favorite.
[ Laughing ]
"Do that cheerleader. - - Thank you, baby - - She wants me."
She calls me up--
- How sweet it is to be loved by you --**
"Oh, my God, you're gay !"
Come and dance with us come on ... purge your demons!
How long are you going to stay drunk?
How would you prefer me?
Perhaps riding in the head of my four legions to meet him in battle?
For yet another victory celebration?
A true king is not a coward!
I am not a coward
I am merely a fool in exile with no place to hide except my wife's country
Enough!
Enough!
Everybody out!
Out
Be well
I trusted you
I believed in you
"I, l believed in your strength"
Could I have misjudged you?
You misjudged yourself
It may be your nature to see victory in defeat
"But it's not mine, I fear...l fear..."
I fear I can lead no more...
I should have died...l should have... where's my sword?
I had a sword...
I must die...
I must die with honor My men believed in me...
I must have it...
Stop it!
Give me my sword!
Give me my sword!
I must have my honor!
This is no honor!
ls this how you want them to remember you?
"I am ASlAN, Man."
Who cares?
"Dude, Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole (Slap) Owwww.."
"""Bottom of the totem pole""?"
That is the most low self-esteem crap.
I have ever heard
This is a fact
The only people that say Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole are Asian guys!
I have never heard a girl go
I don't date Asian guys cuz they are
The bottom of the totem pole
Oh my god.
You are so right!
Never heard that before... from a girl
Asian guys!
Why are we so pessimistic?
We are smart
We are clean
We don't sweat a lot.
We are exotic.
We are super exotic!
Asian guys are really at the bottom of the totem pole which we are not it's not cuz we are ugly or cuz we smell bad
It's cuz we have little.....
Confidence
Yeah.
Confidence.
You..
"You were thinking something dirty,"
Weren't you?
"Asian guys, we need to stand up."
We need to stand up and... and be brave.
We need to stand up and grow a pair
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.

What is that?

If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.

"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
They made me scared.

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way
"We kept keeping on, feelings were so strong"
Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You could always find a little more time
To show me I was number one
Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
You first go home.
- Let us go home.
"Ok, come on let us go."
Is that you?

I have to take you to my friends immediately.

Rain is my friend.
Correct madam.
It rained when we first met.

Your testimony and your blessings.
How did you know the deceased  when he was still healthy and among us?
[Crowd:]
He was a good man!
- Do you testify that he was a good muslim?
- We do!
"Earthly or unworldly, materially and spiritually make all your rights halal to him."
Helal olsun.

"- One more time, for God's blessings."
- Helal olsun.
"May God accept your prayers, your testimony and blessings for the deceased."
May he rest in peace.
It's a very fine piece.
Hand made.
Great craftsmanship.
But this alone don't mean much.
It is valuable only with its pair.
Otherwise it's just like a button.
Wish you could find the other one as well.
Then I wouldn't want to sell it.
"Anyway, maybe we'll find it."
If we can't...
Then my husband will keep it as a heirloom.
- Thank you.
"- Have a nice day, miss."
We've come with great news.
Is that so?
How nice.
The forward buyings are going great.
We revitalized the market.
- Glad to hear that.
There isn't one penny at the bank
We could find the money here
What if we don't find anything?
"I dunno, but I'm sure we'll find something"

You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
On the good ship lollipop.
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
Lemonade stands everywhere.
Crackerjack bands fill the air.
And there you are
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.
See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll
With the big bad devils food cake.
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
You'll awake with a tummy ache
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away

Woman:
Nick?
Is it really you?
It is.
Oh... ( chuckling )
"Oh, my dear, lost love!"
I'm paralyzed with happiness.
"Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, nick carraway."
"Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no?"
I hope it means we do.
Tom says you've just come from chicago.
Tell me everything.
Do they miss me?
The whole town is desolate.
"Oh, how gorgeous."
All the cars have their left rear wheel
"Painted black as a mourning wreath,"
And there's a persistent wail all night.
"Let's go back tomorrow, tom."
I love a persistent wail.
"Well, I love a drink."
"Come on, let's all have a drink."
( sighs )
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
You live across the sound in west egg.
I know somebody there.
I don't know a single person.
You must know gatsby.
This place is quite big for a robot safari park.
"Ah, there's the border."
Hello!
A real elephant has come here.
What are you talking about?
But look...
-Then go over to that side.
"-Yes, sir!"
There is an invisible beam fence around this place.
Then where did this elephant come from?
It can never enter this place!
It must be a robot.
"No, this is a real..."
Leave.
I'm busy.
This is a real one for sure.
But it is true that it did come from somewhere.
"Hey, where did you come from?"
Hold on.
"Atom, Atom."
He's late.
Where did he go?
Doctor Ochanomizu.
Welcome to our safari park.
"Hey, Doctor Hura."
How is it?
Isn't this a wonderful park?
I feel reluctant to use animals for hunting even if they were robots.
You are still too serious.
Real animals are decreasing in its number recently.
So I developed animal robots that's the same as real ones so tourists can observe them and enjoy hunting.
That's why I opened this safari park in this vast field of Africa.
"No, I don't."
I don't know.
What are you saying?
I...
I can't remember.
I drank and blacked out.
"That is why I told you to be careful, didn't I?"
There are always eyes everywhere.
Who the heck did something like this?
"President, who brought these photos?"
I will immediately just!
There is no need for that.
I already took care of it.
Indeed!
"Still, we can't be relieved."
We don't know when other photos will circulate.
That can't happen.
All my female fans will disappear.
These photos are completely embarrassing.
"So, go abroad for awhile and take a rest."
It is easier to take care of it when you aren't around.
What about the schedules?
"Do you know the saying, ""penny-wise and pound-foolish?"""
We can't incur a great loss by pursuing a small profit.
Go!
Go Dong will be waiting for you downstairs.
Hyungnim!
Over here!
What is this?
It's this car again?
The President said to be careful so that we aren't seen by others.
"Get in, Hyung."
"Until then, that name did not exist."
"And so, the name ""christian"" was made to name Jesus's disciples."
"Christian, in its true form, it is the disciple of Jesus."
Jesus's follower.
But Jesus wants followers?
He wants disciples?
Of course!
The last word before going to the heavens was:
"""Therefore, go and make disciples."""
The last thing He said!
"Normally, the last words of a man is the most important thing, the legacy he will leave."
Jesus said:
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
He begins with this.
Matthew 28.18.
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
"""Therefore, go and make disciples"""
"Of where? ""of all the nations."""
From all places.
"""I want disciples, in all places,"""
"""of all nations."""
How to make disciples?
He answers:
"""Baptizing them in the name of the Father,"""
"""the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"""
"""and teaching them"" what?"
"""To obey everything I have commanded you."""
"""And surely I am with you always,"""
"""to the very end of the age."""
"So, in this job, I will help you."
You can fix my word here too.
[indecipherable chatter]
[Other panelist]
"I will tell you guys, while Don's been talking, I've been up here occasionally and Chris, you tweeted to me, I responded."
I've been actually tweeting.
This answers your question Glen earlier.
"I'm using a wireless bluetooth keyboard connected to my phone and a bluetooth headset, which is why you guys haven't heard my phone babbling to tweet to various things that people have been answering."
[undecipherable comments]
[Other panelist]
Not my phone you can't.
[Coordinator in back of room]
I can't hear it from here.
[Other panelist]

[Mooji:]
"'Mooji,' it says."
"'Buddha,'"
This one I don't know:
'Kovan' Kovan?
'...
"Kovan, Shiva, Jesus...' and then in brackets it says,"
"I think, '[Matthew 6:21] all speak of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi."
They describe it as self-effulgent.
Can these be enlightenment...
"Kanji, people say you're doing this for publicity?"
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
- You?
- You will sit here.
"Sit, sit."
Hey insurance..
How's the Rolex?
Working fine.
Relax.
Relax.
He's the one who spread the rumour about God eating butter.
All rise.
"Kanji, get up."
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"- Yes, sir."
We've been informed that you'll defend your own case.
Yes..
"I don't have any other option, Your Honour."
The other lawyers are scared.
"So, I'll have to defend this case.."
"My lordship, this is a baseless appeal."
A publicity stunt.
There's no cause of action that can be proved in court.
"So I suggest, under order 7 rule no.11.. ..of the code of civil procedure."
This case be straightaway dismissed.. ..for out of cause action.
"Your Honour, my English isn't that good.. ..but I do understand that he's asking.. ..to shut down this case immediately."
Right?
You're right.
I don't want to get into this hassle in the first place.
"I'm a Gujarati, businessman."
(Applause)
That's right.
"Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,"
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.
"Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?"
How about a two-digit number?
Audience:
22.
AB:
22.
"And another two-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
47.
AB:
"Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working."
"Do all of you get 1,034?"
"1,034?"
Volunteer:
No.
AB:
594.
Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
(Applause)
"Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?"
"OK, great."
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
That's OK.
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
"There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself."
"For instance, five squared would be?"
Audience:
"Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"
Dressmaking's easy Every customer's call
Brings a whole new revision
Have to pick up the pace Still hold to my vision
"That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor."
"French haute couture, please."
What if it rains?
Galoshes!
More balloons!
"Oh no, that's too many balloons."
More candy!
"Oh, less candy."
"Oh wait, I know."
Streamers!
-Streamers?
-Whose dress is this?
Streamers it is.
What?
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Do you not like the color?
"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Do you not like the shape?
"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler."
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
All we ever want is indecision
All we really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
Making sure we make a good appearance
Even if you simply have to fudge it
Make sure that it stays within our budget
Got to overcome intimidation
Lyuty and his men are billeted there.

Vodka!
"Way to go, the black head!"
"You're sharp, Gypsy!"
I know a pure-blooded little filly when I see her!
How can you tell?
By her teeth.
I looked round -
A coffin flying over the graves!
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound!
"Drink, sinner!"
Learn to partake of our fare.
I'm confident with that news.
My source is reliable.
Who is your source?
Tell us so we know.
You will have to spill it out in court anyway.
I'm lose my mind...
There's the sworn statement of the girl.
And there's the gendarme reports.
Easy now...
Save yourself to the prosecutor.
You can't fabricate news like that.
You'll publish a refutation.
- Okay...
- I'll get your newspaper shut down.
I'll sue both you and your source.
You may come in.
"Mustafa, ignore her son."
Madam.
Madam.
Your husband left these bags for you.
Can you imagine my uncle?
He got furious.
And Selim is a wreck...
That's a bummer...
Just when we thought the things were settling.
Won't you say something?
What do you want me to say?
Don't think we're safe just because only Selim's name's involved.
"If Münir Abi can't stop it, then all the newspapers will write about it."
"And when they dig deeper, they'll find out more."
We will all be screwed.
They'll find out about all of us.
Our faces smile
Our glasses are up high

I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
You can all take your time on this;
"I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right."
"To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,"
"let's say, one, two, three, four."
"If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square."
Nine.
Seven.
Five.

(Laughter)
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?
"So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?"
Does yours go higher?
Volunteer:
I don't know.
AB:
"Oh, yours does?"

I can probably do it.

Yeah.
All right.
But there is one other piece of information that is very important that I have got to tell you.
And that is that only fools aim for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER]
"Okay, go to it."
Watch your ball.
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles been launched?
Yes.
Fantastic.
All right.
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha particle that backscattered?
"Okay, so now I've got to count."
Keep your hands up because there are some lights that make it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?
Yes.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Six.
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?
That's it?
Six alpha particles that backscattered.
"Okay, so now we have to calculate some probabilities here."
The probability of backscattering is the number that backscattered.
Chandra:
"So, do they ask you then?"
I'll make it clear.
It's before we start dating.
They'll know that I'm an asexual person.
"And I'll make it clear when we're, you know, when we're still in the friend stage."
Elisabeth:
Do they see it as a challenge?
"Do they think, ""Well, I'm gonna get him to be sexual."" ?"
[laughter]
David:
"A couple people have, but it hasn't worked out."
Star:
"So, do you not have sex?"
"I mean, do asexual people not have sex at all?"
No sexual contact?
David:
"There's a couple of aexual people who, kind of as a compromise because they're in a relationship with sexual people."
It's not like a code.
It's not like we kick you out or something.
Joy:
"Well, let me ask you something."
[laughter]
Do you ever have sex with yourself?
[laughter]
David:
It's a valid question.
[laughter]
"Perfectly, perfectly, valid question."
[applause]
Joy:
You may not be attracted to anyone else but that doesn't mean you're not attracted to yourself.
It works fairly well for typical cases.
And then we've got the Knuth-Morris-Prath
Method that can guarantee linear time and has no backup.
And maybe uses extra space unless you use Pratt's version.

Ashley:
This is how I ground myself in my sexuality (laughter)
Majestic:
I like it when you get your hands going.
Oh there they go!
David:
"Over 6,000."
Elisabeth:
"Over 6,000?"
"So, there are plenty of people, um, experiencing this as well, like you do"
"So, can you just explain for everybody exactly what being an asexual actually means and how it is to live that way?"
David:
An asexual person is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.
David:
"So, the way that, you know, most sexual people walking down the street and you see someone or you're in a relationship with someone at some point, you feel like introducing sexuality into that."
That just never happens to asexual people.
Joy:
And is it a problem?
David:
"No, it's not a problem."
Joy:
"So, then, why do you need to organize?"
[laughter]
David:
There's a lot of things that are not a problem that you can organize around.
"We need to organize, well, partially, because it's not getting talked about."
"Because, um-"

"If you're not talking about sex, what's there to talk about?"

"The fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats. This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important."
"Humans have some problems with the system, because though they share the physiology with other animals, they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice. Humans can try to talk their way through various problems and semi-threats, but they may suffer stress when the issues are not easily solved."
Other responses.
Animals respond in many ways to situations which threaten them. The fight/flight choice is just one alternative. At one extreme is the way mother cats with kittens will defend them to the death if necessary. Another situation is the way many animals keep still when a predator is nearby. Their camouflage is often effective.

Today it is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done in houses, instead of on stage."
"A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the ""Kyomai"" or Kyoto style dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period.

"Founded by David Belle in France, practitioners only use efficient movements to develop their bodies and minds, and to be able to overcome barriers in an emergency. It may also be a form of entertainment or a hobby."
"Acrobatics (such as flips and wall flips) are not part of parkour, because of inefficiency in a difficult situation (emergency). Freerunning is the branch of parkour, when such flips are used rather than efficient movement."
"In 1988, David Belle was 15 years old. His father Raymond Belle was a great fireman. David was influenced by his father. He left school at the age of 16 and his father helped him to make him stronger. David and his classmates began to create new actions to train themselves. They named it parkour."

History.
"The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was ""Westpalmbeach"", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the ""Calaboose"" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."
"Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead."
"In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district."

"Boy, the way Glenn Miller played"
songs that made the hit parade
Guys like me we had it made
Those were the days
Didn't need no welfare state
ev'rybody pulled his weight
gee our old LaSalle ran great
Those were the days
And you knew who you were then
girls were girls and men were men
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content
fifty dollars paid the rent
freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little Sunday spin
go to watch the Dodgers win
Have yourself a dandy day
that cost you under a fin

Siegbert Tarrasch
"Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a German doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day."
"Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism."
"Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;p411"
"Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine."
Chess author.
"Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His ""Dreihundert Schachpartien"" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the ""praeceptor mundi"", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine ""One of the monuments of our game"".f/w"
"Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the ""Deutsch Schachzeitung"", the German-language chess magazine. These annotations were read throughout the world, since that was the leading chess magazine of the day."
"In his later elementary textbook ""The game of chess"" (1931) he wrote"

User Datagram Protocol
"The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a core member of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols used for the Internet. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, known as ""datagrams"", to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in ."
Ports.
"UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response."
"Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named ""well-known"" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access."
"Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports."
"Ports 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers."
Uses.
"There are many uses for UDP, for example BitTorrent optionally uses it for peer-to-peer file sharing. The Teredo tunneling protocol uses UDP."

Echizen forged knives
"Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Fukui prefecture, Japan. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in its creation. ""Nimai hiroge"" (double layering), and ""Mawashi hagane tsuke"" (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristic techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979."
History.
"The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-cho period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to ""Echizen no kuni"" (present Echizen city) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen city became an area famous for their production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen city became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets."
Two main processes.
"The two main important processes: ""nimai hiroge"" and ""mawashi hagane tsuke""."
...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a machine hammer.
...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond.

Example for different signals at the output to a motor:
Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine:
Communication.
There are basically two ways of communication:
From the machine to the Simatic.
"In the machine, there are sensors. A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine. For example, how fast the motor rotates, what the temperature is or when the current action is completed. All this information is necessary for the program. The sensors give out an electrical signal, each signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit. So the program knows what´s going on in the machine. This is very important, because now the program can perform the next correct step in its sequence. For example, if the temperature of the motor is too high, the program has to know it. Now the program will switch off the motor."
From the Simatic to the machine.
"In the machine, there are actuators. They cause a wanted motion, action or forming. Examples for actuators are a motor, a heater or a light. If the program says that it´s time to switch on the light in the machine, the right output of the Simatic unit will be set. That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light."
The name Simatic.
"The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens, since 1958. Simatic connects “Siemens” and “Automatic” in one word."
Product lines.
Siemens developed four different product lines so far:
Used Software.
Every automation system needs a program to control a machine. To create a program you need a software. Siemens created their own software for their products.

Register (linguistics)
"A register, in linguistics, is the way people use different words, spelling or grammar—talk or write differently—to different people, in different situations. They might be more polite to strangers, for example. Or they will be more respectful to their boss at work."
This chart shows the words or phrases that one would use depending on different registers:
Stratum (linguistics)
"In linguistics, a stratum, or strate, is a language that changes another language or is changed by another language."
"A substratum is the language which is changed, and a superstratum is the language that changes it. An adstratum is two languages changing each other at the same time."
Language transfer
"Language transfer is where a person uses their knowledge of one language when they learn another one. This can help them, but it can also confuse them."

"Hematopoiesis (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cells. In a healthy adult person, about 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. The process is called hematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=""Birbrair n/a–n/a""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the core (bone marrow) of most bones."
As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type.
HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.

SR Class 2Wim
"2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class."
SR Class 4DD
"Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."
Network SouthEast
"Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England. Before 1986, the sector was known as London &amp; South Eastern."

Discourses on Livy
"The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli."
It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured.
"While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a ""kingly state"" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a ""civil way of life"". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as ""princes"". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism."
Product rule
"In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication."
formula_1
formula_2.
Steps.
Say we have the function formula_3.
The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.
We can set
formula_6 and
formula_7.
The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.
"We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14."
"To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18."
"Now we can substitute the values into the equation,"
formula_19.
Proof.
One definition of a derivative is
"formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21."
formula_24
We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.
formula_25
"The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,"
"formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32."
"formula_33, and formula_34 and formula_35 are just equal to formula_15and formula_37."
Brazing
Brazing is a metal-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
Brazing differs from welding because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering.
"During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action."
"The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength."
Sequoia
Sequoia or Sequoyah may refer to:
Balsamic vinegar
"Balsamic vinegar is made from grapes. The name is derived from a Hebrew word meaning ""spicy."" The condiment is very strong, so it is applied to food usually in a small amount. It can be used to dress fresh fruit, salads, and meat dishes."

Dietitian
A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.
"Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers."
In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.
"The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians."
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
"Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers."
"Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well."
Mycology
"Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and psychoactive substances."
A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist.
"Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi."
"Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants."
"Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle."

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

Yeah.
"So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day."
"I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, it was very different before."
How do you dress?
"Well, I'm a drafter,"
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and I have sweatshirt on today.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much the norm for me.
"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"

"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that

She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."

"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"

"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
"Yeah,"
yeah
"And these days that helps, doesn't it?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
I mean
You know
"But it is nice,"
"it is a, it is really a nice area."
"I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,"

Oh.
And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
"Oh, good heavens"
Not me
I avoid the sun
"Well, yeah,"
"basically I do, too."
"Yeah,"
"it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass."
And I try to cover up when I do the lawn
"Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly."
"Yeah,"
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems"
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.

"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"
"Yeah,"

Exactly.
Go ahead.
"And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,"
Exactly.
"let them, do it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what I think they're saying too.
Have you had any snow up your way?
"No,"
"we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas"
"and, uh we had a lot before Christmas."
Um.
The ski resorts were really
"and, uh,"
"but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,"
"so,"
"but no, uh, no snow."
Um.
"The snows all melted off uh,"
"Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend"
"and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way."
"Uh-huh,"
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"

"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."

"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.

"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"

No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."

"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"

"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
"And, uh, until next time."
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

"Well, are you going to buy a car soon?"
"Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to retire."

And what are you going to buy?
"I I don't know,"
"we're either going to buy a pick up,"
or we're going to buy a van.
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,"

"Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones that, that all have air bags?"
"Uh, yeah."
Does that make a difference to you?
Yeah.
It sure does.
I like to watch those skins games.
Uh-huh.
"Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know,"
for each hole they win they get the money for it.
Uh-huh.
I think those are pretty exciting.
"Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf."
"You hit a little ball,"
"you chase it,"
"you go find it,"
and then you hit it again and lose it again.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,"
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.
Oh really
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.
"Oh, I know."
"Oh, yeah."
My husband and his buddies are not very good.
They play like maybe once a month or less
"Uh-huh,"

I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
"It was brand new, white,"
it was like a big marshmallow.
"When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you."
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
"and I mean, they did whatever"
"and, and we went for a test drive in that"
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
"And I wanted it,"

"Yeah,"
"there, there's something about having a place to live,"

"And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical."
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
"Yeah,"

"So,"
"I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars."
"They are, they're pretty aren't they lately"
Yeah.
"And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive."
They really are.
"and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know."
Huh.
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either."
Not at all.
"I'm not real sure what the,"
What do you think about capital punishment?
"Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes."
Yeah.
Which crimes do you feel that?
"Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it."
Yeah.
"Because of,"
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent

"Thomas Ellis was the first European settler in the area known today as Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area."
"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

"SS ""Calabria was a passenger and cargo steamship. AG Weser built her for Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was launched as D/S ""Werra and completed in 1922. (""D/S"" stands for ""Dampfschiff"" in German as ""SS"" stands for ""steamship"" in English.)"
"In 1935 she was bought by Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale, who renamed her Calabria. In 1937 she was sold to Lloyd Triestino."
"In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) was going to rename her Empire Inventor, but she was sunk before this had been done."
"The Allied Powers seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as prize ships or afterwards for war reparations. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from Bremer Vulkan, AG Vulcan Stettin and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; ""Werra"" among them."
"""Werra"" was one of a series of six sister ships that AG Weser built for NDL. ""Werra"" and were completed in 1922; , and in 1923 and in 1924."
"""Werra"" had two three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines and twin screws. Between them her two engines were rated at 604 NHP. ""Werra"" was equipped with wireless direction finding and submarine signalling."
"In 1935 NDL sold ""Werra"", ""Coblenz"" and ""Saarbrücken"" to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them ""Calabria"", ""Sicilia"" and ""Toscana"" and registered them in Genoa. In 1937 the three ships were sold to Lloyd Triestino, which registered ""Calabria"" in Trieste."
"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer."
"""Calabria"" left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Schütze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."
"The oldest man aboard was ""Calabria""s chief cook, Santan Martins, who was 79 years old. Martins may have been the oldest merchant seaman killed at sea in the Second World War."
"Those who died in ""Calabria""s sinking are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her Indian seamen and supernumaries are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai."

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

"A group of Seebees from the 3rd Construction Battalion detachment with a Marine anti-aircraft battery and a company of colored infantrymen arrived on Santo on 8 July 1942 to begin work on Turtle Bay airfield. The Seebees were given twenty days in which to construct the airfield, assisted by 295 infantrymen, 90 Marines, and 50 natives. A runway was cleared and surfaced with coral in time to meet the deadline. On 28 July the first fighter squadron came in and was followed the next day by B-17s of the 26th Bombardment Squadron. The planes were fueled from drums and carried out their first attack on Japanese forces on Guadalcanal on 30 July."

The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

"Salomon (de) Koninck (1609 - buried 8 August 1656) was a Dutch painter of genre scenes and portraits, and an engraver."
"Koninck was born in Amsterdam, the son of a goldsmith, originally from Antwerp, and was a nephew of Philips de Koninck. Salomon became a pupil of Pieter Lastman, David Colijns, François Venants and Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert. From 1630 he was a member of the Sint Lucasgilde. He moved in the circles of Rembrandt and the academy of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, making many copies of Rembrandt's compositions. His paintings have a warm colour palette and include many ""philosophers"" or scholars. Perhaps one of the better known of these is the ""Philosopher with an Open Book"" at the Louvre that was long attributed to Rembrandt and served as companion piece to Rembrandt's ""Philosopher in Meditation""."
He married a daughter of Adriaen van Nieulandt and later a sister of Antonie van Stralen. He died in Amsterdam in 1656.

"The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets ."
"The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""8-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. The best known is 240, from the E lattice and the 5 honeycomb."
formula_1 contains formula_2 as a subgroup of index 270. Both formula_1 and formula_2 can be seen as affine extensions of formula_5 from different nodes:
"The D lattice (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8). It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1))."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four ""D8 lattices"": It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 16 (""2n"" for n≥5). and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, ."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 256 8-demicube facets around each vertex.

Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school."
The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students.

At first, the office was held by the two-star rank air officer, an Air Vice Marshal, and later upgraded to a three-star rank, Air Marshal. The British Air Council continued making the appointment at the command level until 1957, when Pakistan had promoted a local air officer to the commanding position."
"On 20 March 1972, the title of the office was changed from ""Commander in Chief"" to the ""Chief of Air Staff"" with Air Marshal Zafar Chaudhry being appointed as the first person to hold the latter title. The Air Force had its first four-star rank officer, an Air Chief Marshal, in 1974. The term of the superannuation was then constrained to three years in the office as opposed to four years and air chief was made a permanent member of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Since 1974, there has been 14 four-star rank air force officers who have commanded the air force as its air chief."

"Delta is an American sitcom starring Delta Burke that aired on ABC from September 15, 1992 to August 25, 1993. It was a new starring vehicle for Burke, as her return to television following her dismissal from the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women"" in the spring of 1991."
"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."
"Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"", reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The theme song was ""Climb That Mountain High"" by Reba McEntire which was not a charted single; the tune was featured on Reba's 1990 MCA album ""Rumor Has It""."
"The sitcom premiered September 15, 1992, to healthy ratings following ""Roseanne"". It then moved to Thursday nights opposite FOX's ""The Simpsons"", and ratings began to sink. It was pulled from the schedule in December 1992 and returned to ABC the following spring 1993 for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring (even refilming the opening credits to correspond with the change in hair color), in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save it."

"Built in 1905, Island House was built as the residence for the first British Police Magistrate appointed in 1898. It is one of the declared monuments of Hong Kong."
"Tai Wong Yeh Temple () is located at the Island House Interchange. The temple was originally a stone tablet which was erected on the northern shore of Yuen Chau Tsai by the villagers in Chik Mei Village, located on the north bank of the Shenzhen River, in the mid-Qing Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty, some fishermen raised funds to build the temple for worship by local fishermen at the present location."

"Richards was born in rural Adair County, Kentucky, and played basketball for one year at Adair County High School. He was recruited to play baseball at Western by Coach E. A. Diddle (better known as the basketball coach). Diddle got Richards into officiating high school basketball. After graduation, Richards was hired as head basketball coach at Auburn High School. He went from there to Glasgow High, where he coached the Scotties to a state championship in 1968."
"Richards returned to Western as an assistant the following year, when an opening occurred on John Oldham's staff after Gene Rhodes left to coach the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association. When Oldham left the sidelines to become athletic director, Richards became head coach for the 1971-1972 season."

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.

He is considered a veteran Nasserist and a long-time advocate of pan-Arab unity. He has authored several books specializing in Egyptian and Arab politics. He is a resident of Shobra and a Coptic Christian."
"Iskander began his career in activism as a staunch Nasserist. Throughout the 1970s, during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, he was part of the anti-Sadat student movement and won in two student union elections. He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison."
"When the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP) was legalized in 1992 Iskander joined the party, which was founded by Diaa al-Din Dawoud, but later left the party in 1998 along with other members of the ""new guard"" after disagreements with the party's leaders. Along with former ADNP cadre Hamdeen Sabahi, Iskander co-founded the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama""). He continued his activism, being instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian-Palestinian solidarity movement in 2000 after the start of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against the Israeli occupation. He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation."
"These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement. Iskander was one of the principal leaders of the movement and became a vocal opponent of the planned, succession of Gamal Mubarak, Hosni's son, to the presidency which Iskander criticized as ""presidential inheritance."""
"Iskander joined the youth-led protests of the 2011 Egyptian revolution on its first day, 25 January and was arrested by security forces while protesting in Cairo's Shobra district on the first day. He continued protesting after his release on 27 January. He became the Dignity Party's secretary-general in 2011. Iskander strongly condemned the killing of mostly Coptic Christians protesters during the Maspero demonstrations on 9 October.

"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."

All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

"Argimiro Pérez García (born 14 March 1959), commonly known as Pichi Lucas, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker, and is a coach."
"He spent most of his career with Celta, for which he appeared in 288 official games and scored 92 goals. His La Liga input consisted of 113 matches and 18 goals over six seasons, also representing in the competition Compostela."
Lucas subsequently worked as a manager.
"Born in Camponaraya, Castile and León, Lucas' professional career was solely associated to two Galician clubs, RC Celta de Vigo and SD Compostela. After a loan to lowly Córdoba CF, he returned to the former for the 1981–82 season, scoring a career-best 26 goals in 37 games ""en route"" to a La Liga promotion."
"Lucas made his debut in the Spanish top flight on 5 September 1982, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–1 away loss against Sevilla FC. He netted his first goal in the competition twenty days later in a 2–2 home draw with RCD Español, but only added another until the end of the campaign and his team was eventually relegated back; during his tenure with Celta, he experienced a further two promotions and relegations."
"In the summer of 1991, after one year in Segunda División B with neighbouring CD Ourense, Lucas signed for Compostela from Segunda División. He contributed with nine goals in 28 matches in his third season, as the club reached the top flight for the first time in its history."
"Lucas retired at the end of the 1994–95 campaign at the age of 36, after helping ""Compos"" retain their newfound status by scoring four times in only 14 appearances."
"From 1998 to 2000, Lucas acted as interim manager at Compostela, being in charge for eight second level games combined and winning only two. He subsequently worked mainly in lower league football, helping SD Ponferradina reach division two in 2006, a first-ever for the club."
"Lucas was fired on 30 April 2007 after a 3–3 home draw against UD Vecindario (seven rounds remaining), as the side went on to suffer relegation. In the following years he worked in the third tier, with FC Cartagena, Real Oviedo, Celta de Vigo B and FC Jumilla."

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo ( 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II."
"Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy."
"Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as ""rector"" of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon."
"In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci ""rector"" of Tuscia (Tuscany), as well as ""capitano"" (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto ""Ascendit de mare""."
"When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year)."
"In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily."
"In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250. He was initially buried in the Abbey of Citeaux, but later his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi at Viterbo, which he had built in 1217–1221 as a gift to his personal friend, Saint Dominic."

"Baldwin 60000 is an experimental steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin."
"It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is ."
"60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks."
"This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today."
"After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons."
"Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades."
"In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption."
"On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad."
"In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal."
"Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute."

"Vicia villosa, known as the hairy vetch, fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to some of Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state — as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces."
"Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (""Vicia cracca""), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem."
Several subspecies are recognized:
"The species ""Vicia hirsuta"" is also called hairy vetch."
"Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production."
"Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting."
"It is regulated in the state of Florida. Some sources consider it generally invasive in areas with suitable climate for it to out-compete native species, in a manner similar to how cow vetch, ""Vicia cracca"", is regarded. With both vetches, their agricultural usefulness is typically given precedence over concerns regarding potential ecological degradation. Despite being native to part of Europe it is considered an alien or invasive species in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain."

"In 2003, Cabinet approved the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, who said that new regulations were needed to cater for changes in the aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes in the last few years to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization).

"In April 2004, Suleman was jailed for 21 months, with a 12-month non-parole period, for four fraud offences."
"Two days shy of being released from a 21-month jail term in 2005 the corporate regulator struck again, laying 26 new charges."
Karl Suleman Enterprizes fleeced 2062 investors who committed $130.7 million between them – by inviting them to invest in a trolley collection business that promised investors returns of 100 per cent a year.
"But instead of their money going into that business, the money was used to fund Suleman's extravagant lifestyle."
"Suleman and his wife Vivienne bought properties, luxury cars, boats and planes, sponsored charity events and gave lavish gifts as well as dinners for former United States presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton."
Some of the money was used to service a $13 million loan taken out to finance a range of IT and mobile phone ventures under the Froggy Group banner.
"Documents filed with the court by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed that investors, mostly from Sydney's Assyrian community, were induced to put between $50,000 and $150,000 into the trolley business on the promise that they would receive fortnightly returns of between $4000 and $25,000."
"While investors received some fortnightly payments as promised, the money earned by the trolley collection business fell well short of being sufficient to sustain the promised payments."
"The company's liquidators said in their report that between July 2000 and November 2001 the business made a net profit of $275,096 but was paying out $2 million a week to investors seeking high returns."
"Suleman started the trolley business in 1993, providing trolley collections from supermarkets stretching from Cairns to Adelaide. Supermarkets paid Suleman an agreed fee out of which he paid subcontractors to do the work."
The District Court heard 15 people invested more than $3 million in Suleman's supermarket trolley collection business in 2000 and 2001.
"Thirteen of them lost a total of more than $800,000."
The founder of the Froggy Group – was sentenced to 7 and a half years jail after pleading guilty to 26 charges.
The judge found Suleman knew the income from his business was not enough to repay the investors.
"He said it was serious white collar crime, and that Suleman had breached the trust of naive investors so he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income."
"Two years after being released from jail on 20 June 2013, 52-year-old Suleman suffered a heart attack at his home in Horningsea Park Sydney."

"Pani Dihing Wildlife Sanctuary () is a wildlife sanctuary located in Sivasagar district, Assam. It is away from Sivasagar town. This protected area was established as a Bird Sanctuary in August 1999 by the Government of Assam."
The climate of the area is moist tropical and annual temperature ranges between 8-35 Celsius annually. Annual rainfall is approximately 3200 mm with a relative humidity of 65-85 %.
The sanctuary is bordered by the Brahmaputra and the Dishang rivers in the north west and south respectively.
"As many as 267 species of birds including 70 species of migratory birds have been identified and recorded at Pani Dihing. The common birds seen here are bar-headed goose, greylag goose, spot-billed duck, mallards, gadwall, wigeon, garganey, shoveller, red crested pochard, common pochard, ferruginous duck, adjutant stork, kingfisher, lesser adjutant stork, open bill stork, white necked stork. The rare griffon and white-rumped vultures have also been spotted at the sanctuary."
"Although an important birding area supporting a very large population of birds, Pani Dihing has suffered on account of poaching, grazing of cattle and fishing within the sanctuary premises."
= = = Betty Burstall = = =
Betty Margaret Burstall (4 February 192614 June 2013) was an Australian theatre director who founded the La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in 1967. Burstall and her theatre are credited with leading the growth of contemporary theatre in Melbourne during the 1960s and 1970s.
"Burstall was inspired to establish the theatre after returning from New York City. She introduced off-Broadway contemporary theatre to Melbourne through La Mama. Numerous actors and writers have appeared and worked at La Mama, including Graeme Blundell, Kerry Dwyer, Jack Hibberd, and John Romeril, all of whom formed the Australian Performing Group. In 1976, Burstall turned over the day-to-day operations of La Mama to Liz Jones, who remains the theatre's artistic director as of 2013. Burstall remained the chief script adviser until about 1998."
"Betty Burstall was predeceased by husband, film director Tim Burstall, in 2004. She died on 14 June 2013, at the age of 87, survived by two sons and their wives, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The actress Sigrid Thornton is her daughter-in-law."
"As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals."
"The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003."
"The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case."
"In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less."
"This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer."
Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15. Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win. and 6mm Rem. are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform.
"The 243 WSSM is 3/8 inch shorter than the 243 Win. giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle."
The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

"Its vertex figure ""6.10/3.6/5.10/7"" is also ambiguous, having two clockwise and two counterclockwise faces around each vertex."
It shares its vertex arrangement with the truncated dodecahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the great icosicosidodecahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common) and the great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common).
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

He went on to criticize the graphics, specifically, ""muddy textures, 2D explosions, blocky structures, disappearing polygons, and frequent slowdown"". David Smith of IGN shared similar sentiment with regards to the graphics of the same console version, noting the dull palette of greens, browns, and grays and the muddy textures. He went on to praise the simple controls and entertaining voice acting, but denounced the gameplay as dull and easy. He concluded that ""Four-player support should have been included."""

"The affine tangent bundle formula_7 admits an affine connection formula_24 which is associated to a principal connection on an affine frame bundle formula_8. In affine gauge theory, it is treated as an ""affine gauge field""."
"Given the linear bundle coordinates (1) on formula_26, an affine connection formula_24 is represented by a connection tangent-valued form"
This affine connection defines a unique linear connection
"on formula_4, which is associated to a principal connection on formula_12."
"Conversely, every linear connection formula_32 (4) on formula_33 is extended to the affine one formula_34 on formula_7 which is given by the same expression (4) as formula_32 with respect to the bundle coordinates (1) on formula_26, but it takes a form"
relative to the affine coordinates (2).
Then any affine connection formula_24 (3) on formula_40 is represented by a sum
of the extended linear connection formula_34 and a basic soldering form
"on formula_4, where formula_45 due to the canonical isomorphism formula_46 of the vertical tangent bundle formula_47 of formula_7."
"Relative to the linear coordinates (1), the sum (5) is brought into a sum formula_49"
"of a linear connection formula_32 and the soldering form formula_51 (6). In this case, the soldering form formula_51 (6) often is treated as a ""translation gauge field"", though it is not a connection."
"Let us note that a true translation gauge field (i.e., an affine connection which yields a flat linear connection on formula_4) is well defined only on a parallelizable manifold formula_1."
"In field theory, one meets a problem of physical interpretation of translation gauge fields because there are no fields subject to gauge translations formula_55. At the same time, one observes such a field in gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media because, in the presence of dislocations, displacement vectors formula_56, formula_57, of small deformations are determined only with accuracy to gauge translations formula_58."
"In this case, let formula_2, and let an affine connection take a form"
"with respect to the affine bundle coordinates (2). This is a translation gauge field whose coefficients formula_61 describe plastic distortion, covariant derivatives formula_62 coincide with elastic distortion, and a strength formula_63 is a dislocation density."
Equations of gauge theory of dislocations are derived from a gauge invariant Lagrangian density
"where formula_65 and formula_66 are the Lamé parameters of isotropic media. These equations however are not independent since a displacement field formula_67 can be removed by gauge translations and, thereby, it fails to be a dynamic variable."
"In gauge gravitation theory on a world manifold formula_1, one can consider an affine, but not linear connection on the tangent bundle formula_4 of formula_1. Given bundle coordinates (1) on formula_4, it takes the form (3) where the linear connection formula_32 (4) and the basic soldering form formula_51 (6) are considered as independent variables."
"As was mentioned above, the soldering form formula_51 (6) often is treated as a translation gauge field, though it is not a connection. On another side, one mistakenly identifies formula_51 with a tetrad field. However, these are different mathematical object because a soldering form is a section of the tensor bundle formula_76, whereas a tetrad field is a local section of a Lorentz reduced subbundle of a frame bundle formula_12."
"In the spirit of the above-mentioned gauge theory of dislocations, it has been suggested that a soldering field formula_51 can describe ""sui generi"" deformations of a world manifold formula_1 which are given by a bundle morphism"
where formula_81 is a tautological one-form.
Then one considers metric-affine gravitation theory formula_82 on a deformed world manifold as that with a deformed pseudo-Riemannian metric formula_83 when a Lagrangian of a soldering field formula_51 takes a form
"where formula_86 is the Levi-Civita symbol, and"
is the torsion of a linear connection formula_32 with respect to a soldering form formula_51.
"In particular, let us consider this gauge model in the case of small gravitational and soldering fields whose matter source is a point mass. Then one comes to a modified Newtonian potential of the fifth force type."
