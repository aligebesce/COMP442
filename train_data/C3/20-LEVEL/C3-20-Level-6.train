I think we can easily put erm pits for daily life or how to be environmental.
And then
Oh a few tips.
Oh
With respect I really think it ought to be recycling and nothing else.
Mm.
"Well I just find these, I mean we had quite a few  now"
Cos recycling sort of comes into the tips for daily life as well though doesn't it.
It's part of it.
Like protecting  people don't just save bottles they save their glass jars
seem to be patronizing people when really you just want to give information.
as well.
People don't always think of.
Yeah.
"Re-using things, re-using things is almost the same  as recycling isn't it?"
Re-use?
Yes.

Yeah.
Erm.
So.

the main thing I suppose.
"This was dropped on me out of the blue, I must admit this course"
"Was it , okay?"
Right

Measure  the works

Well I don't think
Now
what Hughie's saying is that that will be done
Th that responsibility
mutually
valuations because we've got this
Mm.
Perhaps you do.
"which, which"
Personally I don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement.
"I think, I think it should all be, you know, basically it should be done from"
The offices.
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole.
It's all part of the measuring anyway.
You're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
In accordance with the  and the er the
what do you call it?
Yeah well.
The
Preamble.
preamble.
"Can I take it then, that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator discusses with the team quantity surveyor at the"
Who does what.
Yes.
Who does what because
Yes.
Get it chopped up.
It's a great laugh!
Mm.
But we want one of those halogen jobs.

Mm.
Oh you're joking!
About five hundred.
Not bad!
"You can't burn stuff on them either, can you?"
"On the halogen ones, no."
It's a
Exactly!
So that's a definite bonus!
"Well it wasn't, although they'd actually be going around burning ourselves anyway!"
"I do, you know those frying pans that you bought, the frying pans and saucepans?"
"An , you know the metal bit that's by the handle  that's a really poor safety device!"
Poor?
On the saucepans there's a metal rim  sort of piece at the end of the handle
Is there?
that that touches the actual saucepan
Yes.
when you pick that up you put your thumb on it!
I
And I burnt myself so many times on that!
Don't pick it up so close to the handle then!
Yeah but it's
What on liquidated damages?
Next.
Shut up .
"S safe, okay."
"Procedure K zero stop one, safety related admin."
"I'm making the point that man management procedures erm, sorry, safety instructions and information and safety information will not be issued via management procedures."
"Management procedures w will relate, will only contain procedures relating to the admin of safety matters."
Yes.
Good.
Excellent
Go back to the clerical section

And there's talking about labelling of defective equipment and what have you.
Good.
And I've been ordered to .
Right.
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in !
"`` When poor Fred became convinced that I could n't promise him , he behaved beautifully -- though that rather made things worse ."
"If he had been nasty about it I would n't have felt so heartbroken and remorseful -- though why I should feel remorseful I do n't know , for I never encouraged Fred to think I cared a bit about him ."
Yet feel remorseful I did -- and do .
"If Fred Arnold never comes back from overseas , this will haunt me all my life ."
"`` Then Fred said if he could n't take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship , and would I kiss him just once in good-bye before he went -- perhaps for ever ?"
"`` I do n't know how I could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful , interesting things ."
They are horrible .
"I could n't even give poor heartbroken Fred one little kiss , because of my promise to Ken ."
It seemed so brutal .
"I had to tell Fred that of course he would have my friendship , but that I could n't kiss him because I had promised somebody else I would n't ."
"`` He said , ` It is -- is it -- Ken Ford ? '"
`` I nodded .
It seemed dreadful to have to tell it -- it was such a sacred little secret just between me and Ken .
`` When Fred went away I came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter .
I told her .
"She listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said , ` Can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby ? '"
"But she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic , oh , just so race-of-Josephy -- that I felt indescribably comforted ."
Mothers are the dearest things . ''
"` But oh , mother , ' I sobbed , ` he wanted me to kiss him good-bye -- and I could n't -- and that hurt me worse than all the rest . ' ''"
"` Well , why did n't you kiss him ? '"
asked mother coolly .
"` Considering the circumstances , I think you might have . ' ''"
"` But I could n't , mother -- I promised Ken when he went away that I would n't kiss anybody else until he came back . '"
`` This was another high explosive for poor mother .
"She exclaimed , with the queerest little catch in her voice , ` Rilla , are you engaged to Kenneth Ford ? ' ''"
"` I -- do n't -- know , ' I sobbed . ''"
` You -- do n't -- know ? '
repeated mother .
"`` Then I had to tell her the whole story , too ; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant anything serious ."
I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through .
`` Mother sat a little while in silence .
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
was the answer .
"`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! ''"
"After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer ."
"`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically ."
"And not long after , without another word , he passed away ."
"In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco ."
"He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle ."
"Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours ."
This seemed mightily to relieve him .
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
"But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body ."
"`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand ."
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
"It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . ''"
Then he pulled me aside .
"`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? ''"
"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later ."
"`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said ."
"`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . ''"
`` How do you mean ? ''
I asked .
"`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load ."
"That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain ."
"`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do ."
"But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . ''"
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
"Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood ."
`` Oho ! ''
said the captain .
`` Blaze away !
"You 've little enough powder already , my lads . ''"
"At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage ."
We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall .
"For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House ."
There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I came by you and Matcham .
"I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together ."
"Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself ."
"But see , '' he added , `` this poor shrew begins a little to revive ."
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
"The knight , from under his long dress , produced a stout bottle , and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient , who returned gradually to consciousness , and began to roll dim eyes from one to another ."
"`` What cheer , Jack ! ''"
said Dick .
"`` It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel !"
See ! ''
"`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' said the knight ."
`` This will give you manhood .
"Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall ."
"For , Dick , '' he continued , laying forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls ."
"Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down ."
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lads will pick me their way home .
"Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six ."
"Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''"
"And so saying , the knight filled himself a horn of canary , and pledged his ward in dumb show ."
"`` Selden , '' Dick faltered -- `` Selden '' -- And he paused again ."
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
"he cried , in a changed voice ."
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
"The knight heard in silence ; but as he listened , his countenance became convulsed with rage and grief ."
"`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook ."
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
Not you !
"As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand ."
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
"I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another ."
"Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream ."
"The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon ."
"Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye ."
"He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring ."
`` John ! ''
"said the sailor , stretching out his hand ."
`` Hands off ! ''
"cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast ."
"`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other ."
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
"But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? ''"
`` That ? ''
"returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass ."
`` That ?
"Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . ''"
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero .
`` Alan ! ''
he cried .
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman !
"And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more ."
"If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty ."
"You 've killed Alan , have you ?"
"Kill me too , if you can ."
But I defies you . ''
"And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach ."
But he was not destined to go far .
He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King .
"`` I saw her only for a moment , '' he said coldly , `` but she impressed me as being a beautiful woman . ''"
"`` They tell queer stories about her -- but maybe they 're not all true , '' said Isabel , unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice ."
At that moment Alan 's secret contempt for her crystallized into pronounced aversion .
He made no reply and they went the rest of the way in silence .
"At her gate Isabel said , `` You have n't been over to see us very lately , Mr. Douglas . ''"
"`` My congregation is a large one and I can not visit all my people as often as I might wish , '' Alan answered , all the more coldly for the personal note in her tone ."
"`` A minister 's time is not his own , you know . ''"
`` Shall you be going to see the Olivers ? ''
asked Isabel bluntly .
`` I have not considered that question .
"Good-night , Miss King . ''"
On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question .
Should he make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of Four Winds ?
"It surprised him to find how much he wanted to , but he finally concluded that he would not ."
They were not adherents of his church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone .
"When he got home , although it was late , he went to his study and began work on a new text -- for Elder Trewin 's seemed utterly out of the question ."
Even with the new one he did not get on very well .
At last in exasperation he leaned back in his chair .
Why ca n't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people ?
"Here , let me put these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them ."
That girl had a beautiful face but a cold one .
Would I like to see it lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free ?
"Yes , frankly , I would ."
She looked upon me with indifference .
Would I like to see her welcome me as a friend ?
"I have a conviction that I would , although no doubt everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable friend for me ."
"Do I believe that she is wild , unwomanly , heathenish , as Mrs. Danby says ?"
"No , I do not , most emphatically ."
"I believe she is a lady in the truest sense of that much abused word , though she is doubtless unconventional ."
"Having said all this , I do not see what more there is to be said ."
And -- I -- am -- going -- to -- write -- this -- sermon .
`` What my mother hopes .
"John , what are -- '' But Hook had found his voice again ."
`` Tie her up ! ''
he shouted .
It was Smee who tied her to the mast .
"`` See here , honey , '' he whispered , `` I 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ''"
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise .
"`` I would almost rather have no children at all , '' she said disdainfully -LSB- scornfully -RSB- ."
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they were about to take .
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they could stare and shiver only ."
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward Wendy ."
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one .
"But he never reached her , he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her ."
He heard something else instead .
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile .
"They all heard it -- pirates , boys , Wendy ; and immediately every head was blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but toward Hook ."
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators ."
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him .
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint .
He fell in a little heap .
"The sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought , `` The crocodile is about to board the ship ! ''"
Even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted .
"Left so fearfully alone , any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working , and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go ."
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke ."
`` Hide me ! ''
he cried hoarsely .
"They gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard ."
They had no thought of fighting it .
It was Fate .
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile climbing it .
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid .
It was Peter .
"If you can not attend to your business , I shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who can ."
The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is really getting beyond endurance . ''
A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella 's tongue .
All her bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and eyes .
"For one moment she was determined to speak out , to repay Mrs. Liddell 's insolence in kind ."
A retort was ready to her hand .
"Everyone knew that Mrs. Liddell , before her marriage to a wealthy man , had been a working girl ."
"What could be easier than to say contemptuously : `` You should be a judge of a clerk 's courtesy and ability , madam ."
You were a shop girl yourself once ? ''
"But if she said it , what would follow ?"
Prompt and instant dismissal .
And Patty ?
The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in Marcella 's soul .
For Patty 's sake she must control her temper -- and she did .
"With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly : `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Liddell ."
I did not mean to be inattentive .
"Let me show you some of our new lingerie waists , I think you will like them . ''"
But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella brought to her in her trembling hands .
For another half hour she examined and found fault and sneered .
"Then she swept away with the scornful remark that she did n't see a thing there that was fit to wear , and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything worth looking at ."
"When she had gone , Marcella leaned against the counter , pale and exhausted ."
She must have a breathing spell .
"Oh , how her head ached !"
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was !
She longed for the country herself .
"Oh , if she and Patty could only go away to some place where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills where the air was sweet and pure !"
During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool beside the bargain counter .
"When a clerk asked her if she wished to be waited on , she said , `` No , I 'm just waiting here for a friend who promised to meet me . ''"
She was tall and gaunt and grey haired .
"She had square jaws and cold grey eyes and an aggressive nose , but there was something attractive in her plain face , a mingling of common sense and kindliness ."
She watched Marcella and Mrs. Liddell closely and lost nothing of all that was said and done on both sides .
Now and then she smiled grimly and nodded .
"`` I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter , '' exclaimed Murray rapturously , not meaning a syllable of it , but devoutly believing he did ."
Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray heard music that was not of the birds .
"It was a girl 's voice singing beyond the maples to his left -- a clear sweet voice , blithely trilling out the old-fashioned song , `` Five O'Clock in the Morning . ''"
`` Mrs. Palmer 's niece ! ''
Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples .
He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt reasonably well acquainted with her .
"Moreover , Mrs. Palmer had assured him that Mollie was a very pretty girl ."
Now a pretty girl milking cows at sunrise in the meadows sounded well .
Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece 's beauty .
Murray said so to himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey less than ten yards away from him .
Murray 's artistic instinct responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction .
"He could see only her profile , but that was perfect , and the colouring of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something to adore ."
"Her hair , ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the morning wind , was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her bare head , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were as white as marble ."
"Presently she began to sing again , and this time Murray joined in ."
She half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the maples .
"Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly , but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about her lips ."
"That , and the revelation of her full face , decided him ."
He sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of lush clover blossoms .
"`` Good morning , '' he said coolly ."
"He had forgotten her other name , and it did not matter ; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities ."
`` Is n't it rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone ?
May I help you ? ''
Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder .
She had glorious grey eyes .
Her face was serene and undisturbed .
`` Can you milk ? ''
she asked .
"`` Unlikely as it may seem , I can , '' said Murray ."
"`` I have never confessed it to Mrs. Emory , because I was afraid she would inveigle me into milking her fourteen cows ."
But I do n't mind helping you .
I learned to milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm .
May I have that extra pail ? ''
"I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position ."
I should very much like to move about .
"If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '"
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
"I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !"
They have all run away ! ' '
"I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man ."
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
"` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '"
"` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog ."
"` Why , you have only just been made ."
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
"He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter ."
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
"I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant ."
"That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend ."
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
"barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep ."
The weather really did change .
"Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing ."
"But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight ."
"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms ."
"The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white ."
"The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet ."
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
"They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees ."
Never to feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about his work in the valley fields !
Never to stoop with a glad thrill over the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to her !
Jeffrey groaned aloud .
"No , he could not go up to see her that night ; he must wait -- he must strengthen himself ."
Then his heart rebuked him .
This was selfishness ; this was putting his own feelings before hers -- a thing he had sworn never to do .
Perhaps she needed him -- perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer her such poor service as might be in his power .
"He turned and went down through the orchard lane , taking the old field-path across the valley and up the hill , which he had traversed so often and so joyfully in boyhood ."
"It was dark now , and a few stars were shining in the silvery sky ."
The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under them .
Sometimes he felt that he must turn back -- that his pain was going to master him ; then he forced himself to go on .
"The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the dull light , with its leafless vines clinging to it ."
There were no lights in it .
It looked like a home left soulless .
Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked .
"He had expected the maid to open it , put Sara herself came ."
"`` Why , Jeff , '' she said , with pleasure in her tones ."
`` I am so glad to see you .
I have been wondering why you had not come before . ''
"`` I did not think you would want to see me yet , '' he said hurriedly ."
`` I have thought about you every hour -- but I feared to intrude . '' ''
"You could n't intrude , '' she said gently ."
"`` Yes , I have wanted to see you , Jeff ."
Come into the library . ''
He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare calls .
Sara lighted the lamp on the table .
"As the light shot up she stood clearly revealed in it -- a tall , slender woman in a trailing gown of grey ."
"Even a stranger , not knowing her age , would have guessed it to be what it was , yet it would have been hard to say what gave the impression of maturity ."
"Her face was quite unlined -- a little pale , perhaps , with more finely cut outlines than those of youth ."
"Her eyes were clear and bright ; her abundant brown hair waved back from her face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned child of six , under the pines ."
Perhaps it was the fine patience and serenity in her face that told her tale of years .
Youth can never acquire it .
he said .
`` Dinner ? ''
"`` Ay , sot , '' replied the cook , `` dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread ."
"But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart 's desire both of ale and wine ."
"But now are men 's spirits dead ; and this John Amend-All , save us and guard us !"
but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . ''
"`` Nay , '' returned the other , `` y ' are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless ."
Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . ''
"`` Look ye , '' returned the cook , `` I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high ."
"I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king 's archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth !"
and shot the king 's deer .
What cometh of it ?
Naught !
I were better to have bided in the cloister .
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All .
By ' r Lady !
here they come . ''
"One after another , tall , likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn ."
"Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup , helped himself from the caldron , and sat down upon the grass to eat ."
"They were very variously equipped and armed ; some in rusty smocks , and with nothing but a knife and an old bow ; others in the height of forest gallantry , all in Lincoln green , both hood and jerkin , with dainty peacock arrows in their belts , a horn upon a baldrick , and a sword and dagger at their sides ."
"They came in the silence of hunger , and scarce growled a salutation , but fell instantly to meat ."
"There were , perhaps , a score of them already gathered , when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns , and immediately after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debauched upon the lawn ."
"A tall , lusty fellow , somewhat grizzled , and as brown as a smoked ham , walked before them with an air of some authority , his bow at his back , a bright boar-spear in his hand ."
`` Lads ! ''
"he cried , `` good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y ' have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease ."
But what said I ever ?
"Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift ."
And lo !
"here is her little firstling -- even that good creature , ale ! ''"
There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask .
"`` And now haste ye , boys , '' the man continued ."
`` There is work toward .
"Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle ; the rest rode in pursuit ; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground , and it was plain their quarry would escape them ."
"Hatch , roaring an oath , put his horse at the hedge , to head him off ; but the beast refused , and sent his rider sprawling in the dust ."
"And though he was up again in a moment , and had caught the bridle , the time had gone by , and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture ."
The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton .
"Instead of starting in a vain pursuit , he had whipped his crossbow from his back , bent it , and set a quarrel to the string ; and now , when the others had desisted , he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot ."
`` Shoot !
shoot ! ''
"cried the priest , with sanguinary violence ."
"`` Cover him , Master Dick , '' said Bennet ."
`` Bring me him down like a ripe apple . ''
The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety ; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill ; and the man ran slower in proportion .
"What with the greyness of the falling night , and the uneven movements of the runner , it was no easy aim ; and as Dick levelled his bow , he felt a kind of pity , and a half desire that he might miss ."
The quarrel sped .
"The man stumbled and fell , and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers ."
But they were counting their corn before the harvest .
"The man fell lightly ; he was lightly afoot again , turned and waved his cap in a bravado , and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood ."
`` And the plague go with him ! ''
cried Bennet .
"`` He has thieves ' heels ; he can run , by St Banbury !"
"But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! ''"
"`` Nay , but what made he by the church ? ''"
asked Sir Oliver .
`` I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here .
"Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . ''"
Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper .
"`` This writing was pinned to the church door , '' he said , handing it to the parson ."
"`` I found naught else , sir parson . ''"
"`` Now , by the power of Mother Church , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` but this runs hard on sacrilege !"
"For the king 's good pleasure , or the lord of the manor -- well !"
"But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door -- nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight ."
But what have we here ?
The light falls apace .
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom."
"""Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,"" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor."
THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY
"Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons, and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be with him. Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came to a King who had six daughters; such lovely king's daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts."
"But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the Giant's house was, and there the Giant came out, and set his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone, princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad again."
"""And if I had not you left,"" he said to Boots, ""I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers."""
"""Well, but now I've been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again; that's what I'm thinking of,"" said Boots."
"""Nay, nay!"" said his father; ""that leave you shall never get, for then you would stay away too."""
"But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his sorry old steed."
"""Farewell, father,"" said he; ""I'll come back, never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me;"" and with that he rode off."
"So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Raven, ""give me a little food, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""I haven't much food,"" said the Prince, ""and I don't see how you'll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it."""
So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.
"Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into the water again."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Salmon to the Prince; ""shove me out into the water again, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""Well!"" said the Prince, ""the help you'll give me will not be great, I daresay, but it's a pity you should lie there and choke;"" and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again."
"After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly."
"""Dear friend, do let me have your horse,"" said the Wolf; ""I'm so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I've had nothing to eat these two years."""
"""No,"" said Boots, ""this will never do; first I came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can't be done, that it can't, for then I should have nothing to ride on."""
"""Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,"" said Graylegs the wolf; ""you can ride upon my back, and I'll help you again in your utmost need."""
"""Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great, I'll be bound,"" said the Prince; ""but you may take my horse, since you are in such need."""
"So when the Wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolf's jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the Wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before."
"""When we have gone a bit farther,"" said Graylegs, ""I'll show you the Giant's house."""
So after a while they came to it.
"""See, here is the Giant's house,"" said the Wolf; ""and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go."""
"""Nay, but I daren't go in,"" said the Prince; ""he'll take my life."""
"""No! no!"" said the Wolf; ""when you get in you'll find a Princess, and she'll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you."""
"Well! Boots went in, but, truth to say, he was very much afraid."
"When he came in the Giant was away, but in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the Wolf had said, and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on."
"""Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?"" said the Princess, as she saw him; ""it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his body."""
And he told them all about it.
"But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the matter in his hands."
"""But what about my baby?"" said John."
"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."""
"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale."
"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!"""
"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."""
"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet."
"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night."""
"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut."
"The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid."
"Good night, sir."""
"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began."
"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever."
"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night."""
The baby went on screaming.
"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?"""
"""I do, a little,"" said the mother."
"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes."""
"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby."
"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet."
"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town."""
"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."""
"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation."
"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain."
"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses."
"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week."
"The baby named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon."
"The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser."
"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town."
"""We're lost,"" said the mayor. ""I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats by his teeth."""
"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them."
"Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it."
"It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who heard it."
"When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, ""I will catch her to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the others."" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, ""Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry."" He said, ""No. But from to-day, you and I are one."" So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly."
"Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit."
"The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying, ""You must have known it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me."" And that was all the revenge she took."
The Cruel Crane Outwitted
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
"Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish."
And a crane thought on seeing the fish:
"""I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."""
"And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it."
"When the fish saw him, they asked him, ""What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?"""
"""I am sitting thinking about you,"" said he."
"""Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?"" said they."
"""Why,"" he replied; ""there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, 'What in the world will these fish do now?'"""
"""Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?"" said they."
"""If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it,"" answered the crane."
"""That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at."""
"""Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."""
"Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore."
"Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond."
"And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, ""All right, sir! You may take us with you."""
"Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there."
"But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:"
"""I've thrown that fish in; let another one come."""
"And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more!"
"But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out:"
"""I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!"""
"""But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"""
"""I'll bite hold of you with my beak."""
"Boston ladies gave up tea and used the dried leaves of the raspberry, and the girls of 1777 graduated in homespun. Could the iron heel of despotism crunch such a spirit of liberty as that? Scarcely. In one family at Newport four hundred and eighty-seven yards of cloth and thirty-six pairs of stockings were spun and made in eighteen months."
"When the war broke out it is estimated that each Colonial soldier had twenty-seven pairs of blue woollen socks with white double heels and toes. Does the intelligent reader believe that ""Tommy Atkins,"" with two pairs of socks ""and hit a-rainin',"" could whip men with twenty-seven pairs each? Not without restoratives."
"Troops were now sent to restore order. They were clothed by the British government, but boarded around with the Colonists. This was irritating to the people, because they had never met or called on the British troops. Again, they did not know the troops were coming, and had made no provision for them."
"Boston was considered the hot-bed of the rebellion, and General Gage was ordered to send two regiments of troops there. He did so, and a fight ensued, in which three citizens were killed."
"In looking over this incident, we must not forget that in those days three citizens went a good deal farther than they do now."
"The fight, however, was brief. General Gage, getting into a side street, separated from his command, and, coming out on the Common abruptly, he tried eight or nine more streets, but he came out each time on the Common, until, torn with conflicting emotions, he hired a Herdic, which took him around the corner to his quarters."
"On December 16, 1773, occurred the tea-party at Boston, which must have been a good deal livelier than those of to-day. The historian regrets that he was not there; he would have tried to be the life of the party."
"England had finally so arranged the price of tea that, including the tax, it was cheaper in America than in the old country. This exasperated the patriots, who claimed that they were confronted by a theory and not a condition. At Charleston this tea was stored in damp cellars, where it spoiled. New York and Philadelphia returned their ships, but the British would not allow any shenanegin', as George III. so tersely termed it, in Boston."
"Therefore a large party met in Faneuil Hall and decided that the tea should not be landed. A party made up as Indians, and, going on board, threw the tea overboard. Boston Harbor, as far out as the Bug Light, even to-day, is said to be carpeted with tea-grounds."
"George III. now closed Boston harbor and made General Gage Governor of Massachusetts. The Virginia Assembly murmured at this, and was dissolved and sent home without its mileage."
"Those opposed to royalty were termed Whigs, those in favor were called Tories. Now they are called Chappies or Authors."
"On the 5th of September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia and was entertained by the Clover Club. Congress acted slowly even then, and after considerable delay resolved that the conduct of Great Britain was, under the circumstances, uncalled for. It also voted to hold no intercourse with Great Britain, and decided not to visit Shakespeare's grave unless the mother-country should apologize."
"In 1775, on the 19th of April, General Gage sent out troops to see about some military stores at Concord, but at Lexington he met with a company of minute-men gathering on the village green. Major Pitcairn, who was in command of the Tommies, rode up to the minute-men, and, drawing his bright new Sheffield sword, exclaimed, ""Disperse, you rebels! throw down your arms and disperse!"" or some such remark as that."
"The Americans hated to do that, so they did not. In the skirmish that ensued, seven of their number were killed."
"Thus opened the Revolutionary War, a contest which but for the earnestness and irritability of the Americans would have been extremely brief. It showed the relative difference between the fighting qualities of soldiers who fight for two pounds ten shillings per month and those who fight because they have lost their temper."
"The regulars destroyed the stores, but on the way home they found every rock-pile hid an old-fashioned gun and minute-man. This shows that there must have been an enormous number of minute-men then. All the English who got back to Boston were those who went out to reinforce the original command."
"The news went over the country like wildfire. These are the words of the historian. Really, that is a poor comparison, for wildfire doesn't jump rivers and bays, or get up and eat breakfast by candle-light in order to be on the road and spread the news."
"General Putnam left a pair of tired steers standing in the furrow, and rode one hundred miles without feed or water to Boston."
"Twenty thousand men were soon at work building intrenchments around Boston, so that the English troops could not get out to the suburbs where many of them resided."
I will now speak of the battle of Bunker Hill.
"This battle occurred June 17. The Americans heard that their enemy intended to fortify Bunker Hill, and so they determined to do it themselves, in order to have it done in a way that would be a credit to the town."
"A body of men under Colonel Prescott, after prayer by the President of Harvard University, marched to Charlestown Neck. They decided to fortify Breed's Hill, as it was more commanding, and all night long they kept on fortifying. The surprise of the English at daylight was well worth going from Lowell to witness."
"Howe sent three thousand men across and formed them on the landing. He marched them up the hill to within ten rods of the earth-works, when it occurred to Prescott that it would now be the appropriate thing to fire."
"He made a statement of that kind to his troops, and those of the enemy who were alive went back to Charlestown. But that was no place for them, as they had previously set it afire, so they came back up the hill, where they were once more well received and tendered the freedom of a future state."
"Three times the English did this, when the ammunition in the fortifications gave out, and they charged with fixed bayonets and reinforcements."
"The Americans were driven from the field, but it was a victory after all. It united the Colonies and made them so vexed at the English that it took some time to bring on an era of good feeling."
"Lord Howe, referring afterwards to this battle, said that the Americans did not stand up and fight like the regulars, suggesting that thereafter the Colonial army should arrange itself in the following manner before a battle!"
"Washington decided that he must strike a daring blow while his troops had any hope or vitality left; and so on Christmas night, after crossing the Delaware as shown elsewhere, he fell on the Hessians at Trenton in the midst of their festivities, captured one thousand prisoners, and slew the leader."
"The Hessians were having a symposium at the time, and though the commander received an important note of warning during the Christmas dinner, he thrust it into his pocket and bade joy be unconfined."
"When daylight came, the Hessians were mostly moving in alcoholic circles trying to find their guns. Washington lost only four men, and two of those were frozen to death."
The result of this fight gave the Colonists courage and taught them at the same time that it would be best to avoid New Jersey symposiums till after the war was over.
"Having made such a hit in crossing the Delaware, Washington decided to repeat the performance on the 3d of January. He was attacked at Trenton by Cornwallis, who is known in history for his justly celebrated surrender. He waited till morning, having been repulsed at sundown."
"Washington left his camp-fires burning, surrounded the British, captured two hundred prisoners, and got away to Morristown Heights in safety. If the ground had not frozen, General Washington could not have moved his forty cannon; but, fortunately, the thermometer was again on his side, and he never lost a gun."
"September 11 the English got into the Chesapeake, and Washington announced in the papers that he would now fight the battle of the Brandywine, which he did."
"Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot from under him."
"The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia."
"October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the dullest winter of his life."
"The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way."
"A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life."
"He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's troops by a neck."
"Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the militia. Stark said, ""Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow."" This neat little remark made an instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian."
"Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks."
"He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British wit had it, ""gave Gates ajar,"" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks."
"Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open fire."
"Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle, probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command, and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp."
"Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold."
"A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent compositions ever composed."
During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.
"Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to rest and dream of food and freedom."
Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of such heroic sires.
Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination of his personal record.
"In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the struggling troops."
"The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and, alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better facilities for getting home."
"Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a retreat."
"Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him and went away where they could be by themselves."
"From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to Boston for her groceries."
"The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult."
"Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done."
"One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft; though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack."
"Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation."
"""Be you a witch?"" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to the records now on file in the State-House at Boston."
"""No, your honor,"" was the reply."
"""Officer,"" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, ""take her out on the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails with a pair of hot pincers, and then see what she says."""
"It was quite common to examine lady witches in the regular court and then adjourn to the tennis-court. A great many were ducked by order of the court and hanged up by the thumbs, in obedience to the customs of these people who came to America because they were persecuted."
"Human nature is the same even to this day. The writer grew up with an Irishman who believed that when a man got wealthy enough to keep a carriage and coachman he ought to be assassinated and all his goods given to the poor. He now hires a coachman himself, having succeeded in New York city as a policeman; but the man who comes to assassinate him will find it almost impossible to obtain an audience with him."
"If you wish to educate a man to be a successful oppressor, with a genius for introducing new horrors and novelties in pain, oppress him early in life and don't give him any reason for doing so. The idea that ""God is love"" was not popular in those days. The early settlers were so stern even with their own children that if the Indian had not given the forefather something to attract his attention, the boy crop would have been very light."
"Even now the philosopher is led to ask, regarding the boasted freedom of America, why some measures are not taken to put large fly-screens over it."
CHAPTER VI.
THE EPISODE OF THE CHARTER OAK.
The Colonies of Maine and New Hampshire were so closely associated with that of Massachusetts that their history up to 1820 was practically the same.
"Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims, say two years or thereabouts, Gorges and Mason obtained from England the grant of a large tract lying between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers. This patent was afterwards dissolved, Mason taking what is now New Hampshire, and Gorges taking Maine. He afterwards sold the State to Massachusetts for six thousand dollars. The growth of the State may be noticed since that time, for one county cost more than that last November."
"In 1820 Maine was separated from Massachusetts. Maine is noted for being the easternmost State in the Union, and has been utilized by a number of eminent men as a birthplace. White-birch spools for thread, Christmas-trees, and tamarack and spruce-gum are found in great abundance. It is the home of an industrious and peace-loving people."
Bar Harbor is a cool place to go to in summer-time and violate the liquor law of the State.
"The Dutch were first to claim Connecticut. They built a trading-post at Hartford, where they swapped bone collar-buttons with the Indians for beaver-and otter-skins. Traders from Plymouth who went up the river were threatened by the Dutch, but they pressed on and established a post at Windsor."
"In 1635, John Steele led a company ""out west"" to Hartford, and Thomas Hooker, a clergyman, followed with his congregation, driving their stock before them. Hartford thus had quite a boom quite early in the seventeenth century. The Dutch were driven out of the Connecticut Valley, and began to look towards New York."
"Soon after this the Pequod War broke out. These Indians had hoped to form an alliance with the Narragansetts, but Roger Williams prevented this by seeing the Narragansett chief personally. Thus the Puritans had coals of fire heaped on their heads by their gentle pastor, until the odor of burning hair could be detected as far away as New Haven."
"The Pequods were thus compelled to fight alone, and Captain Mason by a coup d'état surrounded their camp before daylight and entered the palisades with the Indian picket, who cried out ""Owanux! Owanux!"""
"meaning ""Englishmen. Englishmen."" Mason and his men killed these Pequods and burned their lodges to the ground. There has never been a prosperous Pequod lodge since. Those who escaped to the forest were shot down like jack-rabbits as they fled, and there has been no Pequoding done since that time."
"The New Haven Colony was founded in 1638 by wealthy church members from abroad. They took the Bible as their standard and statute. They had no other law. Only church members could vote, which was different from the arrangements in New York City in after-years."
"The Connecticut Colony had a regular constitution, said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people, framed for the people by the people. It was at once prosperous, and soon bought out the Saybrook Colony."
"In 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above colonies and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them. It amounted to a duly-authenticated independence. A quarter of a century afterwards Governor Andros, in his other clothes and a reigning coat of red and gold trimmings, marched into the Assembly and demanded this precious charter."
"Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on the dragon's head and said: ""Can I be of any assistance?"""
"Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say nothing else. So the white grouse said: ""One moment. I am only too grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct about the firework!"""
"And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and only their faces peeped out."
"""Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,"" said Jane, ""but you'll be cold yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear feathers?"""
"The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind, soft bird voices."
"""Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts warm!"""
"Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners."
"So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk."
"The dragon had not moved yet but then he might at any moment get warm enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:"
"""You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you."
"What more can you possibly want?"""
"Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: ""Oh, do mind your wings in the fires!"""
For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.
"""What's the matter?"" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail."
So they told him.
"""Sealskin, are they?"" said the moth. ""Just you wait a minute!"""
"He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and the stars."
And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.
"For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls, and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the sealskin fur."
"Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children who eat fur but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When they are not thinking about you they say, ""I fear the moths have got at my ermine tippet,"" or, ""Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak, but it was eaten by moths."" And now there were more moths than have ever been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs."
"The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the very life and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat bare pelts."
"""Oh, thank you thank you, darling Arctic moth,"" cried Jane. ""You are good I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you afterward!"""
"Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings, ""We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves once in a while to oblige a friend."""
"And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!"
"""Oh, dear,"" said Jane, ""this is the worst of all!"""
"""We've no friends left to help us,"" said George. He never thought that the dragon himself might help them but then that was an idea that would never have occurred to any boy."
"It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers the children shivered."
"Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy length over the snow, and said: ""This is something like! How faint those fires did make me feel!"""
"The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die."
"But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and Jane, because they were frozen to his back."
"He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling south with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a million ways of going south from the North Pole so you will own that it was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed, between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace."
"A long debate ensued, and, according to tradition, while the members of the Assembly stood around the table taking a farewell look at the charter, one of the largest members of the house fell on the governor's breast and wept so copiously on his shirt-frill that harsh words were used by his Excellency; a general quarrel ensued, the lights went out, and when they were relighted the charter was gone."
"Captain Wadsworth had taken it and concealed it in a hollow tree, since called the Charter Oak. After Andros was ejected from the Boston office, the charter was brought out again, and business under it was resumed."
"Important documents, however, should not be, as a general thing, secreted in trees. The author once tried this while young, and when engaged to, or hoping to become engaged to, a dear one whose pa was a singularly coarse man and who hated a young man who came as a lover at his daughter's feet with nothing but a good education and his great big manly heart. He wanted a son-in-law with a brewery; and so he bribed the boys of the neighborhood to break up a secret correspondence between the two young people and bring the mail to him. This was the cause of many a heart-ache, and finally the marriage of the sweet young lady to a brewer who was mortgaged so deeply that he wandered off somewhere and never returned. Years afterwards the brewery needed repairs, and one of the large vats was found to contain all of the missing man that would not assimilate with the beer, viz., his watch. Quite a number of people at that time quit the use of beer, and the author gave his hand in marriage to a wealthy young lady who was attracted by his gallantry and fresh young beauty."
"Roger Williams now settled at Providence Plantation, where he was joined by Mrs. Hutchinson, who also believed that the church and state should not be united, but that the state should protect the church and that neither should undertake to boss the other. It was also held that religious qualifications should not be required of political aspirants, also that no man should be required to whittle his soul into a shape to fit the religious auger-hole of another."
"This was the beginning of Rhode Island. She desired at once to join the New England Colony, but was refused, as she had no charter. Plymouth claimed also to have jurisdiction over Rhode Island. This was very much like Plymouth."
"Having banished Roger Williams and Mrs. Hutchinson to be skinned by the Pequods and Narragansetts over at Narragansett Pier, they went on about their business, flogging Quakers, also ducking old women who had lumbago, and burning other women who would not answer affirmatively when asked, ""Be you a witch?"""
"Then when Roger began to make improvements and draw the attention of Eastern capital to Rhode Island and to organize a State or Colony with a charter, Plymouth said, ""Hold on, Roger: religiously we have cast you out, to live on wild strawberries, clams, and Indians, but from a mercantile and political point of view you will please notice that we have a string which you will notice is attached to your wages and discoveries."""
"Afterwards, however, Roger Williams obtained the necessary funds from admiring friends with which to go to England and obtain a charter which united the Colonies yet gave to all the first official right to liberty of conscience ever granted in Europe or America. Prior to that a man's conscience had a brass collar on it with the royal arms engraved thereon, and was kept picketed out in the king's grounds. The owner could go and look at it on Sundays, but he never had the use of it."
"With the advent of freedom of political opinion, the individual use of the conscience has become popularized, and the time is coming when it will grow to a great size under our wise institutions and fostering skies. Instead of turning over our consciences to the safety deposit company of a great political party or religious organization and taking the key in our pocket, let us have individual charge of this useful little instrument and be able finally to answer for its growth or decay."
CHAPTER VII.
THE DISCOVERY OF NEW YORK.
The author will now refer to the discovery of the Hudson River and the town of New York via Fort Lee and the 125th Street Ferry.
"New York was afterwards sold for twenty-four dollars, the whole island."
"When I think of this I go into my family gallery, which I also use as a swear room, and tell those ancestors of mine what I think of them. Where were they when New York was sold for twenty-four dollars? Were they having their portraits painted by Landseer, or their deposition taken by Jeffreys, or having their Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes made?"
"Do not encourage them to believe that they will escape me in future years. Some of them died unregenerate, and are now, I am told, in a country where they may possibly be damned; and I will attend to the others personally."
"Twenty-four dollars for New York! Why, my Croton-water tax on one house and lot with fifty feet four and one-fourth inches front is fifty-nine dollars and no questions asked. Why, you can't get a voter for that now."
"Henry or Hendrik Hudson was an English navigator, of whose birth and early history nothing is known definitely, hence his name is never mentioned in many of the best homes in New York."
"In 1607 he made a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage. In one of his voyages he discovered Cape Cod, and later on the Hudson River."
This was one hundred and seventeen years after Columbus discovered America; which shows that the discovering business was not pushed as it should have been by those who had it in charge.
"Hudson went up the river as far as Albany, but, finding no one there whom he knew, he hastened back as far as 209th Street West, and anchored."
"He discovered Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and made other journeys by water, though aquatting was then in its infancy. Afterwards his sailors became mutinous, and set Hendrik and his son, with seven infirm sailors, afloat."
Ah! Whom have we here?
"It is Hendrik Hudson, who discovered the Hudson River."
"Here he has just landed at the foot of 209th Street, New York, where he offered the Indians liquor, but they refused."
How 209th Street has changed!
The artist has been fortunate in getting the expression of the Indians in the act of refusing. Mr. Hudson's great reputation lies in the fact that he discovered the river which bears his name; but the thinking mind will at once regard the discovery of an Indian who does not drink as far more wonderful.
"Some historians say that this especial delegation was swept away afterward by a pestilence, whilst others commenting on the incident maintain that Hudson lied."

"""Nobody! _Nobody!_"""
"""Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand--"""

"""Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...."""
After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few
"moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided"
"miserably. Besides, she was a girl."
"All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could"
help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to
"him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a"
little better.
"The door opened on the signal, ""Sesame."" When Butt saw somebody was"
"with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his"
fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.
"He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered"
his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump
when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.
"""An honor, Miss Sparling,"" he said in that rumbly voice. ""Please come"
"right in. There's a hurry-up draft."""
So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the
"entirely here. This place belongs to her."""

"""I? I have just been released from prison in London, Holloway"
"Prison..."""

"_Vivie_: ""I hate the present British Government--the most"

you say the Fleming?--the Flemish part of Belgium will receive us
"with such pleasure. It is only with the Wälsch, the Wallon part we"
disagree.... But there is so much for me to do--we must talk of all
these things some other time. Let us begin our business. I must
first introduce myself. I am Oberst Gottlieb von Giesselin of the
"Saxon Army. (He rose, clicked heels, bowed, and sat down.) I see you"

"_Vivie_ (taking courage): ""It is my mother's jewellery and some"

"and traded some bonds."""
"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the

"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"
little trading here this morning. Mind getting the bond desk at
Westminster Union on the line? Tell Nogami we're good for a hundred in

"""What?"""
"""We've got company. They look like field reps."""
"""Good God."" Novosty strode to the door and looked out. A group of four"

MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.
"Turning back, he looked imploringly at Vance. ""What do we do?"""
"""Figure they came prepared."" He waved toward Eva. ""Better lose that"

"I began speaking French, but when I paused for his verdict, he shrugged"
"his shoulders, saying:--"
"""Ah, _oui, oui!_ It may be better than my English."" But notwithstanding"
"his scant praise, we spoke the French language thereafter."
"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"
"good Doctor among the stars, as usual. There was a letter for me from"
Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""This is to tell you that M. l'Abbé du Boise will soon be in London. He"
will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.
"""You do not know him. Please call on him when he arrives. Tell the"
Duchess of Hearts that he will want to see her. Ask her to be ready to
"help him. He goes to buy Dunkirk for the French king, and his success"
will mean good fortune for me.
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
more.
"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.
*       *       *       *       *
"Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the"
"door and came back beside me. ""Well,"" he said, swinging to a bunk,"
"""that's sort of it."""
"""You're better off, Butt,"" I burst out. ""You shouldn't have a woman"
"like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget"
"she was trained to run an underwater city!"""
"""Wasn't worrying about that,"" he grinned. ""_I_ grew up in the fifteen"
"long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope."" He turned over on his"
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."
"""It ain't any good talkin',"" said Jack, ""and hevery one knows that"

"for 'em.  For if they was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to"
"whack 'em, and I for one would be on the side of just goin' down"

"The ""old man"" staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand."
"""Have you done it, sir?"" asked Simcox.  ""Let's hear it."""
"""Yes, read it out,"" said Lampert, with half a sneer, which the"
skipper did not notice.
The crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock.
"""On board the British barque _Potluck_, belonging to the British port"
"Liverpool; owners, McWattie & Co.; Captain Abednego Jones."
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir----"""
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Jameson bring Muller along. I am going up to the Deluxe.”
I must say that I was surprised at finding Mrs. Moulton there. Outside
"the suite Winters and I waited with the unresisting Muller, while"
Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he began, “something terrible has happened—”"
"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.
"“Where is Mr. Moulton?” he went on, changing his question."
"“Mr. Moulton is at his office,” she answered tremulously. “He"
"telephoned while I was out that he had to work to-night. Oh, Mr."
Kennedy—he knows—he knows. I know it. He has avoided me ever since I
missed the replica from-”
“Sh!” cautioned Craig. He had risen and gone to the door.
"“Winters,” he whispered, “I want you to go down to Lynn Moulton’s"
office. Meanwhile Jameson can take care of Muller. I am going over to
that place of Stein’s presently. Bring Moulton up there. You will wait
"here, Walter, for the present,” he nodded."
He returned to the room where I could hear her crying softly.

"'Never!' she said, with a brave face; but her heart beat wildly, and a"
mist rose before her eyes.
"He laughed. 'My legions are round me,' he said. 'Where are yours?'"
"'You are a gentleman,' she answered with an effort. 'You will let me"
go.'
'If I do not?'
'There are those who will know how to avenge me.'
"He laughed again. 'I do not know them, Countess,' he said"
"contemptuously. 'For Hesse Cassel, he has his hands full at Nuremberg,"
"and will be likely, when Wallenstein has done with him, to need help"

"stands and waves ever the wider. Be advised,' he continued grimly."
"'Bend, Countess, or I have the means to break you.'"
'Never!' she said.
"'So you say now,' he answered slowly. 'You will not say so in five"
"minutes. If you care nothing for yourself, have a care for your"
friends.'
"'You said I had none,' she retorted hoarsely."
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."

"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."

Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.

"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"

in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep

barely dodged it.

hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.

"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.
"""I should have loved her now,"" I answered at last, ""were it not for one"
"fact."""
"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."

"The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one"
side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a
dying whale.
"""M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians built like that?"""
"""Men like that are worth the mileage!"""
"""_I want him!"" ""I want him!"" ""I want him!_"""
Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She
"was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles"
of fury popping in them.
"""The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!"""
"I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin."
"""What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You"
"_promised_!"""
She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get
"to Venus on foot. ""I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."""
"""My name is Ford and I don't understand."""
"""Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl."
"It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and"
"be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my"
"word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally"
decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"

Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.

"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.

"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.

"saying that. Just take it from me again, both of you, that you'd better"
"not be so slow again in telling me--"""

"The cab stopped at the Bury Street door.  She took his hand, put it to"
"her cheek, and got out.  He said quietly:"
"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""
"""All right.  There'll be time to get you in some things for the night"
after I come back.  I shan't run any risks to-day.  Make Mrs. Markey give

"When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the"

red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"

a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"

"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"

"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"

PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.

"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"
impair the perfect sweetness of memory wherein she held her mother.
"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"
"mind, dear, you mustn't mind. Oh, you didn't think it would make any"
"difference to me, dear, did you? What do I care? Mrs. Puttock may care,"
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
"""Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,"" the"
"Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. ""Hey, purse, remember when the"
whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue
"with Colonel Leclerc?"""
"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"
"Treaty,"" the Captain was saying very loudly, ""I arrest you for"
violation of Articles Sixteen to Twenty-one inclusive of the Space
"Transport Code, and order your person and belongings impounded for"
the duration of this voyage as set forth in Sections Forty-one and

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"
"the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.
*       *       *       *       *
"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--
"""MASTER GEORGE HAMILTON:"
"""Monsieur le Grand wishes you to pay him a visit immediately."
"""DE CATANET."""
"""You probably know Monsieur le Grand?"" I asked."
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""
*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"""Do you remember Pancorbo?"" said Ramon Garcia."
"Rollo could not hear the answer, but he caught the outlaw's next"
question.
"""And have you forgotten El Sarria, who, having a certain Miguelete under"
"the point of his knife, let him go for his sweetheart's sake, because"
"she was waiting for him down in the valley?"""
"The sentry's reply was again inaudible, but Rollo was fully awake now."
"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"
"companions. We are no traitors, but good Carlists to a man. Our papers"
"are----"""
"Here the words were spoken so low that Rollo could not hear more, but"
the next moment he was nudged by Ramon on the leg.
"""Write a note to Concha Cabezos, telling her to bring the papers here at"
"once if she would save our lives. You are sure she is faithful?"""
"""I am sure!"" said Rollo, who really had no reason for his confidence"
except the expression in her eyes.
"He had no paper, but catching the sentry's eye, he nodded across to"
where Etienne was still diligently rolling cigarettes.
"""Alcoy?"" he whispered."
"The sentry shouldered his piece and took a turn or two across the floor,"
mind.  Vaviloff also liked Petunikoff's straightforward manner of
"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"
"said, bitterly:"
"""Now I will have a nice time!  They will laugh at me, they will cry"
"shame on me, the devils!"""
The orator finished his speech and looked upon his hearers with his
"dark, pathetic eyes, seeming to apologise to them for some unknown"
crime.
The public understands it.  They understand the morale of the creature
"who was once a man, the morale of the public-house and much misfortune."
"""Well, brother Yashka, did you understand?  See how true it is!"""
Yakov understood that to beat her incautiously might be injurious to
"his wife.  He is silent, replying to his companions' jokes with"
confused smiles.
"""Then again, what is a wife?"" philosophises the baker, Mokei Anisimoff."
"""A wife ... is a friend ... if we look at the matter in that way.  She"
"is like a chain, chained to you for life ... and you are both just like"
"galley slaves.  And if you try to get away from her, you cannot, you"
"feel the chain ..."""
"""Wait,"" says Yakovleff; ""but you beat your wife too."""
"""Did I say that I did not?  I beat her...  There is nothing else"
handy...  Do you expect me to beat the wall with my fist when my
"patience is exhausted?"""
"""I feel just like that too..."" says Yakov."
"""How hard and difficult our life is, my brothers!  There is no real"
"rest for us anywhere!"""
"""And even you beat your wife by mistake,"" some one remarks humorously."
"said. ""Percy says all Indian butter is bad. Of course, it's only an"
"idea of his, but men are such faddy creatures, don't you think?"""
"""They wouldn't be men if they weren't--"" Mrs. Carmichael had begun,"
"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She
picked them up immediately and went on with an impatient exclamation
at her own carelessness. But the involuntary start had coincided with
"a loud report from outside in the darkness, and a smothered scream."
Lois put down her knife.
"""Won't you come and help me?"" she said to Beatrice. ""Your mother will"
"not notice that you have gone."""
"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"
"cushions, came over to Lois' side."
"""How brave you are!"" she said in a whisper. ""You seem so cool and"
"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"
"am so sorry."""
"“Edith was looking at it when Mr. Trent came in, and forgot to return"
it.”
"“Ah! Boswell, I am sure you are sitting on Mrs. Pendleton’s foot. By the"
"way, how is your aunt?”"
“Dead—better.”
"“I wonder you could tear yourself away so soon,” said Trent, viciously."
“You’d better be careful. She might make a new will.”
“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest fifteen minutes of my life with her
this afternoon. She promised me all.” He turned to Severance. “You have
"been breaking hearts on the beach, I suppose.”"
"“Which is better, at all events, than breaking one’s head against a"
stone wall.”
"“Politics brought you here, I suppose, Mr. Trent,” interrupted Miss"
Decker. “I hear you made a stirring speech the other night.”
“I did. It was on the question of Radicalism in the Press _versus_ Civil
Service Reform. Something must be done to revolutionise this hotbed of
"iniquity, American politics. Such principles need courage, but when the"
hour comes the man must not be wanting—”
"“That was all in the paper next morning,” drawled Boswell. “Mrs."
"Pendleton, did you receive the copy of my new book I sent a fortnight"
"ago? Unlike many of my others, I had no difficulty in disposing of it."
"It was lighter, brighter, less philosophy, less—brains. The critics"
"understood it, therefore they were kind. They even said—”"
"""I have shown it you before.""  Vaviloff looked up suspiciously and"
closely scanned the Captain's face.
"""Show it me!"" shouted the Captain, striking the bar with his fist and"
sitting down on a stool close by.
"""But why?"" asked Vaviloff, knowing that it was better to keep his wits"
about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"
"Court of Justice at the time when I came into possession."""
"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"
"the title-deeds, and everything you have immediately.  You will"
"probably clear at least a hundred roubles over this, do you understand?"""
Vaviloff did not understand at all; but the Captain spoke in such a
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""

Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.
CHAPTER XXI
"""WHAT THE NIGHT HELD"""
"mine must be in the 'ands of them mutilatin' French.  Simcox, you'll"
"'ave to go to 'em again and open n'gotiashuns!"""
"""No, sir,"" said Simcox, ""if you'll excuse me, I'll do nothin' of the"
"sort.  I've had my fill up of bein' ambassador."""
"""This is mut'ny,"" said the skipper; ""but under the painful national"
"circumstances I shan't do nothin' but order you to your cabin, where"
"you'll consider yourself in custody."""
"Simcox looked greatly relieved, and went without delay."
"""Mr. Lampert, you'll be hambassador,"" said the old man, after a drink"
of brandy.
The mate looked the skipper up and down.
"""I'll see you further first,"" he cried.  ""'Twas you that started the"
"row and the trouble, and you can get out of it as you like."""
"""This is rank mut'ny,"" said the skipper, ""and you could be 'ung for"
refusin' duty.  But under the painful nash'nal circumstances you can
retire to your cabin and be your own bloomin' policeman till peace is
"restored, when I'll try you and sentence you, you run and scuttle"
"swine you."""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said the mate contemptuously."
"""Now, men,"" said the skipper thickly, ""what I wants is 'earty"
"support.  Who'll volunteer for to be hambassador?"""
The crew looked at each other and shook their heads.  They scuffled
of the Rogans caught her by the wrists and dragged her forward.
"""They have come to question you,"" Greca lamented to Brand. ""And they"
"want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!"""
Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.
"""You are powerless to struggle,"" he said. ""Do as they ask. You cannot"
"help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't"
"learn anything from us."""
"The tall Rogan teetered up to the prisoners on his gangling legs, and"
"stared icily at them. Crouched beside him, her lovely body all one"
mute appeal to the Earthmen to forgive her for the part she was forced
"to play, was Greca."
At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to
"Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen."
"""He says,"" exclaimed Greca telepathically, ""to inform you first that"
"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"
"globe must do as he commands."""
Brand nodded to show he understood the message.
"""He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to"
"answer truthfully if you value your lives:"""
"""First, he wants to know what the people of your world are like. Are"
"they all the same as you?"""

wings.
"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....
XXIV
"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"

_Proceedings by Captors._
[Sidenote: Custody of Prize Ship.]
"16. Every Ship taken as Prize, and brought into Port within the"
"Jurisdiction of a Prize Court, shall forthwith and without Bulk broken,"
be delivered up to the Marshal of the Court.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find

"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep
"Till, the journey ended, he stands at last"
"In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep."
_Ethel Clifford._
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
"scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or"
"has the time. Then one evening someone finds him reading under a lamppost,"
"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"
forward searchingly.
"""Isn't it--? Oh, no, excuse me, I thought--"""
"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"
"you, very well. And thanks for the knapsack; I understood all at once--I"
"quite understand--"""
"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"
or a shake of the head. I write it down from memory; it was important to
"her, and it became important for others as well."
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.

At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his

glare of Port Townsend and saw in the distance the flashing
searchlights of the forts that guard the Straits. They saw him stop
"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""
"With an exclamation of impatience, the commanding officer stepped to"
"the telegraph, but Emerson forestalled him."
Thursday 2:34 P.M.
Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
"It was a grief to Dick to part from his master; but he saw the need, and"
he loved the horse only second to Grey himself.
"""I will do your behest, master.  Nay, I want no money; I have plenty for"
all my needs.  I too have made some modest wealth here in this great
"city. Only tell me where I may find you, and I will be gone, and do what"
"can be done for the poor beast."""
"""You shall always get news of me at Wills’ Coffee House, good Dicon,"""
"was the answer.  ""Where I go and how I live, I know not yet; but I will"
"leave word there for you.  So now, farewell.  I turn a new page in my"
"life from this day forth."""
*CHAPTER X.*
"*""THE OLD LION.""*"
"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"
eyes.  Did the glance of the other quail ever so little before his?  He
"thought so, but could scarce be certain."
"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes

“Let us think. What sort of a stone would a politician be most likely to
choose?”
Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous
"with conceit, then I think the ruby must have come from Mr. Trent.”"
"“I am sure of it. And as your author is always in the dumps, I am"
certain he takes naturally to the sapphire.”
“But the emerald—”
“Is emblematic of your deluded Teddy. The solitaire therefore falls
"naturally to Mr. Severance. Well, now that you have got through the"
"first interviews in safety, what are you going to do next?”"
"“Edith, I do not know. They are all so dreadfully in earnest that I"
"believe I shall finally take to my heels in down-right terror. But no, I"
won’t. I’ll come out of it with the upper hand and save my reputation as
"an actress. I will keep it up for two or three days more, but after that"
it will be impossible. They are bound to meet here sooner or later.
"Thank Heaven, we are rid of them for to-night, at least!”"
The manservant threw back the portière.
“Mr. Trent!”
"“Heavens!” cried Edith, under her breath; “I forgot to give orders that"
"we were not receiv—how do you do, Mr. Trent?”"
“And which is his ring?” Jessica made a frenzied dab at the jewels in
a case of a woman of her caliber gone wrong.
“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.

"Little-Englanders, denounced him as a Turk, an assassin, a"
"seventeenth-century Spanish _conquistador_ of the bloodiest type, and"
"held him up to popular execration, and recalled him, and put him on a"
beggarly pension years before he had reached his age limit. He could
tell them stories which seemed (and in truth deserved to be) incredible.
"“John,” said Lady Blount, “has heard all this a thousand times,”--as"
"indeed he had,--“and must be sick to death of it. He is not going out to"
Australia as governor-general.”
"“Who said he was, my dear?” said Sir Oliver."
"“If you did n't imply it, you were talking nonsense, Oliver,” Lady"
Blount retorted.
"“Anyhow, Oliver, do you think John is taking a wise step?” Herold"
hastily interposed.
"“I do,” said he; “a very wise step.”"
"“I don't agree with you at all,” said Lady Blount, with a snap of"
finality.
"“Your remark, my dear,” replied Sir Oliver, “does not impress me in the"
least. When did you ever agree with me?”
"“Never, my dear Oliver,” said Lady Blount, with the facial smile of"
the secretly hostile fencer. “And I thank Heaven for it. I may not be a
"brilliant woman, but I am endowed with common sense.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at her for a moment, with lips parted, as if to"
fraught with significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach the
dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"
heels!
"""It was that fool Rochester who set the rumor afloat."""
"After standing through an awkward minute or two, Castlemain bowed stiffly"
"to the king and the duchess, turned away from our group, and soon left"
the ballroom.
"When Castlemain was gone, we all laughed save the king. Presently he left"
"us, and I saw him beckon Wentworth and Berkeley to his side. I followed"
"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""
"exclaimed the king, impatiently. ""You picked up the wrong woman. But"
"Encouraged by these assurances, one of the newcomers said to the other:"
"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"
to each other:
"""I wonder if there's a war on in these parts--I hear the Huns have made"
"a bit of a push."""
"""Curse the blighters--they'll mess up my leave, it's due in a week's"
"time."""
"""Jolly good coffee, this! Here, Marie, bring us another two cups--der"
"coop der caffay--that's right, isn't it?"""
"""Dat's right,"" said the girl, ""you speak goot French--vous avez tout a"
"fait l'accent parisien."""
"Suddenly her sister came running into the room, sobbing loudly:"
"""English soldier come round from Commandant--he tell us Shermans"
"come--ve got to go 'vay at once, ve got to leave everysing--ve go 'vay"
and English troops steal everysing and shellss come and smash everysing
"and ve looss everysing."""
The civilians of the village had received orders to leave immediately.
Through the window we could see groups of people standing in the street
"his _Euralia Past and Present_ the eminent historian, Roger"
"Scurvilegs, does not spare her; but that she had her great qualities I"
should be the last to deny.
"She had been writing poetry that morning, and she wore green.  She"
"always wore green when the Muse was upon her: a pleasing habit which,"
"whether as a warning or an inspiration, modern poets might do well to"
imitate.  She carried an enormous diary under her arm; and in her mind
several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to
the Palace.
"""Good morning, dear Countess,"" said the King, rising only too gladly"
"from his nibs; ""an early visit."""
"""You don't mind, your Majesty?"" said the Countess anxiously.  ""There"
was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite
"certain----"""
"""What _were_ we talking about yesterday?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty,"" said the Countess, ""affairs of state,"" and she"
"gave him that wicked, innocent, impudent, and entirely scandalous look"
"which he never could resist, and you couldn't either for that matter."
"""Affairs of state, of course,"" smiled the King."
"""Why, I made a special note of it in my diary."""
She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages.
"""Here we are! '_Thursday._  His Majesty did me the honour to consult"
"me about the future of his daughter, the Princess Hyacinth.  Remained"
"informant; 'all, from the earliest memory to the latest breath. Like a"
whole landscape called by a flash of lightning out of the dark night. It
"is all there, every bit of it, good and evil, pleasure and pain, sin and"
righteousness.'
A man cannot escape from his life even in death. In our acts of to-day
"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"
"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because

CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
out. I have no more idea than you have.”
It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."
something inevitable you might as well look at it from the more
"cheerful side. After all, there was the chance that we might not have"
"made it this far, you know. Now, tell me honestly, does it make sense"
getting all worried-up by thinking of how horrible it would have been
"if we'd been caught back there when Seventy-nine blew up?"""
"""I suppose not."""
"""Well, then,"" he said in a semi-cheerful tone, ""since we did make it"
"out safely, and are still waiting after eight days, we might as well"
"expect to be collected soon."""
"Charles Andrews said, from behind him, ""At a hundred dollars an hour,"
"Norton?"""
"Norton turned around angrily. ""So it's the hundred clams per,"" he"
"snapped back. ""That's damned poor payment for having to live with the"
"likes of you in a space can this cramped."""
"Andrews eyed the pilot with distaste. ""Tell me,"" he said smoothly,"
"""did my last effort on the pedal generator go for power storage, or"
for a couple of gallons of hot water for that shave and shower you've
"enjoyed?"""
"Norton stretched and stood up. ""I figured that having a clean face"
"might help morale,"" he said pointedly."
"""You're a cheap, chiseling--"""
"""Easy, Andrews! Easy. There's a lady present. Besides, I might forget"
"my easy-going nature and take a swing at you."""
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.

"approaching it slowly."""
blow he could.
"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"Coxon showed more interest now, and remarked,"
"""Why, Gaspard was one of Medland's organisers. I saw him with both"
"Medland and Norburn on Saturday."""
"""I don't suppose they were planning to murder this Benham. Indeed, I"
don't see that the thing can have been political at all. What did it
"matter whether Benham lived or died?"""
"""I don't see that it did, except to Benham,"" assented the Captain. ""But"
"what's become of Gaspard?"""
"""Ah, that they don't know. He's supposed to have taken ship, and they've"
"cabled to search all ships that left the port that morning."""
"""He'll find the man in blue--or the local equivalent--on the wharf,"""
"said the Captain. ""Rather a jar that, Sir Robert, when you're in from a"
"voyage. What are they doing now?"""
"""Well, the Superintendent said they were going to have a thorough search"
"through the dead man's lodgings, to see if they could find out anything"
about him which would throw light on the motive. The police don't think
"much of the political theory of the crime."""
"""Dashed nonsense, _I_ should think,"" said the Captain, and he sauntered"
off to play billiards.
"""That young man,"" said the Chief Justice, ""is really not a fool, though"
"he does his best to look like one."""
"""That queer conduct seems to me rather common in young men at home. I"
"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"“About two miles on the level,” Frank suggested, “and about four hundred"
miles the way the surface of the ground runs.”
"After a short rest the boys proceeded south, climbing over jutting"
"spurs, dipping into depressions, and sliding over stony slopes until"
they were almost too tired to take another step.
"“We’ll get used to this in a month or two,” Harry said, sitting plump"
down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”
"“Running water, too,” added Frank. “Now, where do you think that water"
"comes from, and where does it go to?”"
"""No one can say. A day, a week, a month, a year--it is an elusive search"
"I follow, my young friends. May I call you that?"""
"We bowed, and I deferentially suggested:"
"""If we can help you in any way?----"""
"""It is the beautiful spirit of America,"" he sighed, ""to help those in"
"distress, yet there is nothing to do but watch--watch. For you have not"
"yet been here long enough to see a child in these waters--no?"""
"Tommy, perhaps because he came from the South and was on more or less"
"friendly terms with superstitions, glanced over the rail as if an infant"
might be floating around almost anywhere. Our strange guest's mysterious
"hints were, indeed, rather conducive to creeps."
"Then, without further comment, he arose, tossed his cigar overboard, ran"
"his fingers through his mass of hair, and went below."
"""What d'you suppose he meant?"" I asked, in a guarded voice."
"""Simple enough,"" Tommy whispered. ""He's got apartments to let"
"upstairs."""
"""Get out, man,"" I laughed. ""That chap has more sense than either of us!"""
"""Then he'd better come across with some of it. You remember the freckled"
"lad at Soissons who got fuzzy-headed from too much concussion? Well, he"
"saw children around everywhere, too! It's a sure sign, Jack!"" But now he"
"laughed, adding: ""Oh, I suppose our little Roumanian's all right,"
"only----"""
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Give it to me ...  Perhaps there is something in it about us ..."""
"""About whom?"""
"""About the village."""
"They laughed at him, and threw him the paper.  He took it, and read in"
"it how in the village the hail had destroyed the cornfields, how in"
"another village fire destroyed thirty houses, and that in a third a"
"woman had poisoned her family,--in fact, everything that it is"
"customary to write of,--everything, that is to say, which is bad, and"
which depicts only the worst side of the unfortunate village.  Tyapa
"read all this silently and roared, perhaps from sympathy, perhaps from"
delight at the sad news.
"He passed the whole Sunday in reading his Bible, and never went out"
"collecting rags on that day.  While reading, he groaned and sighed"
"continually.  He kept the book close to his breast, and was angry with"
any one who interrupted him or who touched his Bible.
"""Oh, you drunken blackguard,"" said Kuvalda to him, ""what do you"
"understand of it?"""
"""Nothing, wizard!  I don't understand anything, and I do not read any"
"books ...  But I read ..."""
"""Therefore you are a fool ..."" said the Captain, decidedly. ""When there"
"are insects in your head, you know it is uncomfortable, but if some"
"thoughts enter there too, how will you live then, you old toad?"""
"satellites."""
"""Their vessels are crude, clumsy things. The journey from the nearest"
satellite is the limit of their flying range. They have nothing like
"your wonderful little ships, and they want to know how to build and"
"power them."""

"She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: ""You see, yours is the"
fourth space ship to visit their kingdom; and that makes them fearful
because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop
"that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their"
greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely
"sphere, and they are insatiable in their lust for new territories."
"Thus they plan to go to your planet as soon as they are able, and kill"
or enslave all the people there as they have killed and enslaved my
"race."""
"""They'll have a job on their hands trying to do that!"" declared Dex"
stoutly.
"But Brand paled. ""They can do it!"" he snapped. ""Look at those"
"death-tubes of theirs. We have no arms to compete with that."" He"
"turned to Greca. ""So the Rogans plan to force the secret of our motors"
"from us by torture?"""
"She nodded, and caught his hand in hers."
"""Yes. They will do with you as they did with the six who came before"
"you--and who died before surrendering the secret."""
"write one. I also suggested that we meet in Bettina's parlor, where"
Frances's letter could be rewritten in cipher. We trusted Bettina as we
"trusted ourselves, and when we told her the good news, she clapped her"
"hands for joy, laughing, yet ready to weep, and was as happy as even she"
"could be, which was very happy indeed."
"After we had talked, laughed, and cried a reasonable time in Betty's"
"parlor, Frances handed me her letter, which was a bulky document, well"
taped and waxed.
"""It will require a week for me to translate this,"" I remarked, weighing"
the letter in my hand.
"""What do you mean by translating it?"" she asked in surprise."
"""I must write it out in cipher. Hamilton directed that all letters should"
"be sent in that form,"" I answered, amused at her alarm."
"""No, no!"" she cried, snatching the letter from me, pressing it to her"
"breast and blushing to her ears. ""You shall not see my letter!"""
"""Why?"" I asked."
"""Because,"" she answered."
"""That is no reason,"" I replied. ""Of course you have written nothing that"
"you would not want me or your father to see?"""
"""Well, yes, I have,"" she returned emphatically. ""A great deal. Would you,"
"Betty, want any one to see such a letter written by yourself?"""
"""I suppose I could write a letter which I should want but one person in"
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.
and an uneasy eye.
"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
"truth, I was once a man, though I was not noble.  I care now for"
nothing and nobody ... and all my life has been tame--a sweetheart who
"has jilted me--therefore I despise life, and am indifferent to it."""
"""You lie!"" says Abyedok."
"""I lie?"" roars Aristid Kuvalda, almost crimson with anger."
"""Why shout?"" comes in the cold sad voice of Martyanoff."
"""Why judge others?  Merchants, noblemen ... what have we to do with"
"them?"""
"""Seeing that we are"" ... puts in Deacon Taras."
"""Be quiet, Abyedok,"" says the teacher, goodnaturedly."
"""Why do you provoke him?""  He does not love either discussion or noise,"
and when they quarrel all around him his lips form into a sickly
"grimace, and he endeavours quietly and reasonably to reconcile each"
"with the other, and if he does not succeed in this he leaves the"
"company. Knowing this, the Captain, if he is not very drunk, controls"
"himself, not wishing to lose, in the person of the teacher, one of the"
best of his listeners.
"""I repeat,"" he continues, in a quieter tone, ""that I see life in the"
"hands of enemies, not only enemies of the noble but of everything good,"
"avaricious and incapable of adorning existence in any way."""
"""But all the same,"" says the teacher, ""merchants, so to speak, created"
"Genoa, Venice, Holland--and all these were merchants, merchants from"
"England, India, the Stroyanoff merchants ..."""
"""Don't you sell tea, bread, or anything to eat?"""
"""I trade only in walls and roofs, for which I pay to the swindling"
"proprietor of this hole--Judas Petunikoff, merchant of the second"
"guild--five roubles a month,"" explained Kuvalda in a business-like"
"tone.  ""Only those come to me who are not accustomed to comfort and"
"luxuries .... but if you are accustomed to eat every day, then there is"
the eating-house opposite.  But it would be better for you if you left
off that habit.  You see you are not a gentleman.  What do you eat?
"You eat yourself!"""
"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"
"always with smiling eyes, and also for the attention he paid to his"
lodgers the Captain was very popular among the poor of the town.  It
"very often happened that a former client of his would appear, not in"
"rags, but in something more respectable and with a slightly happier"
face.
"""Good-day, your honour, and how do you do?"""
"""Alive, in good health!  Go on."""
"""Don't you know me?"""
"""I did not know you."""
"""Do you remember that I lived with you last winter for nearly a month"
".... when the fight with the police took place, and three were taken"
"away?"""
"""My brother, that is so.  The police do come even under my hospitable"
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

"They waited, rather expectantly."
"""Cruising's all right,"" I said, without enthusiasm. ""But it's a waste of"
"time to go after romance and adventure. They died with the war."""
"""Ho!--they did, did they?"" he laughed in mock derision. ""What's become"
"of your imagination--your vaporings? You used to be full of it!"" And the"
Mater supported him by exclaiming:
"""Why, Jack Bronx! And I used to call you my Pantheist! Don't tell me"

"What was romance here to the colorful, high-tensioned thing I had seen"
in devastated areas where loves of all gradations were torn and
scattered and trampled into the earth like chaff! Fretfully I told them
this.

"Then Alice added, ""And even if it weren't for the hundred per, he isn't"

"She shook her head. There was no answer to that argument. Furthermore,"
it was the kind of unresolvable argument that could go on and on until
the answer was supplied from the outside. There could be no end to it
until they were either picked up safely or died in lonely space.
"She decided to drop the discussion as pointless, so headed for the"
bathroom. A hot shower and a quick tubbing of her underclothing were
"on her mind. Her garments, of course, would dry instantly. She had"
to smile a little. To think that a hundred years ago women thought
something they called nylon was wonderful because it was fairly
"quick-drying! Not instantaneous, of course, as was the material of"
which her lingerie was made.
"Anyhow, getting it clean now, and having a bath herself would make"
her feel better. And she would be better equipped to face the
nerve-gruelling business of just sitting there watching the clock go
"around and around, with nothing to do but wait."

"Regin Naylo faced his superior with a scowl. ""That rips it wide open,"""
he said.
torrent of rain beat upon the Frangipani's streaming face; he tottered
"on his knees, but still held his hands to the heavens."
"""They lied,"" he cried. ""Give me but life.""--"
The duke looked at him and heaved up his sword.
"Giovanni Frangipani saw the white face above him, gave a great cry and"
cowered behind his hands. It was all ended in a moment. The rain
washed his gilded harness as he lay with his blood soaking into the
crevices of the rocks.--
Francesco had witnessed neither the fight nor the ending. Impelled by
"an insensate desire to find Raniero, to have a final reckoning for all"
"the baseness and insults he had heaped upon him in the past, for his"
"treachery and cruelty to Ilaria, he had made his way to the great"
hall.
The door was closed and locked from within.
Francesco dealt it a terrific blow. Its shattered framework heaved
inward and toppled against the wall.
In the doorway stood Raniero and looked out at his opponent. He did
not recognize Francesco. His face was sullen; the glitter of his
little eyes mimicked the ring gleams of his hauberk. He put out the
tip of a tongue and moistened his lips.
Francesco's face was as the face of a man who has but one purpose left
"in life and, that accomplished, cares not what happens. Raising his"
"vizor, he said:"
"""By Jove,"" he cried, ""the news'll be at the House by now! Come along,"
"man, come along!"""
"And, as they went, they read the rest; for the paper had it all--even a"
copy of that marriage certificate.
CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
Thursday 2:28 P.M.
"""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino"
"said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been"
"completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring"
"the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"""The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,"" Taro Ikeda, the project"
"director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. ""It is the Soviet"
"pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced."" He looked down, searching for"
"the right words. ""I'm concerned. I think he has discovered the stealth"
"capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the same,"
I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
"capabilities."""
"""_So deshoo_."" Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed. ""But he has said nothing?"""
"""No. Not a word. At least to me."""
"""Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It would not be the"
"first time."""
"""The maneuvers. They were too explicit,"" Ikeda continued. ""As I said,"
"two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched off the"
"transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a"
"power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-"
"evasive action."" The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic"
"smile. ""At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's"

(_f_) The title _Lady_ belongs to daughters of all noblemen not lower
than earl.
(_g_) The title _Hon._ belongs to daughters of viscounts and barons;
"also to an untitled woman who becomes a maid-of-honor to the Queen,"
and this title is retained after she leaves the service. If a woman who
has the title _Lady_ becomes maid-of-honor she does not acquire the

Index compound names according to the usage of the author's
"fatherland, though if it is known that his practice differs from"
"this usage, his preference should be followed. Compound names"
then go:
"(_a_) If English, under the last part of the name, when the first has"
"not been used alone by the author: e.g., _Gould, Sabine Baring-_;"
"but _Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O._, and _Locker"
"(afterwards Locker-Lampson)_, because they are well-known under the"
first names.
"(_b_) If foreign, under the first part."
Both such compound names as _Gentil-Bernard_ and such as _Gentil de
"Chavagnac_. There are various exceptions, when a name has been more"
"known under the last part, as _Fénelon_, not _Salignac de Lamothe"
"Fénelon_; _Voltaire_, not _Arouet de Voltaire_; _Sternberg_, not"
"_Ungern-Sternberg_. Moreover, it is not always easy to determine"
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references are necessary
"whichever way one decides each case, especially when the second part"
"lately?"""
"""Very well, I believe. The men were down the other day, and told me it"
"was a big thing."""
"""I'm delighted. How does it seem, to be rich?"""
There was the slightest hint of constraint in the girl's voice as she
"stared out at the slowly gathering twilight, murmuring:"
"""I--I hardly know. Rich! That has always been my dream, and yet--"""
"""The wonderful feature about dreams,"" he took advantage of her pause to"
"say, ""is that they come true."""
"""Not all of them--not the real, wonderful dreams,"" she returned."
"""Oh yes! My dream is coming true, and so is yours."""
"""I have given up hoping for that,"" she said, without turning."
"""But you shouldn't give up. Remember that all the great things ever"
"accomplished were only dreams at first, and the greater the"
"accomplishments, the more impossible they seemed to begin with."""
Something in the girl's attitude and in her silence made him feel that
"his words rang hollow and commonplace. While they had talked, an"
"unaccustomed excitement had been mounting in his brain, and it held him"
now in a kind of delicious embarrassment. It was as if both had been
"suddenly enfolded in a new and mysterious understanding, without the"
need of speech. He did not tell himself that Cherry loved him; but he
"roused to a fresh perception of her beauty, and felt himself privileged"
then! I felt that I had become a different being altogether.
The boat entered the harbour and ran alongside the quay. A train was
waiting for us. We poured out of the ship in two streams that spread out
fan-wise and flowed into the carriages.
It was good to sit by the window in a comfortable compartment and lean
back against soft cushions.
Glad anticipation and barely suppressed excitement were visible on
everybody's face.
"The train sped through familiar country: meadows, pastures, cornfields,"
orchards and woodlands. People waved their handkerchiefs at us from
cottage windows.
It was growing dark as the first rows of drab suburban houses began to
glide past.
So this was London. I stared out of the window and tried to grasp the
"tremendous, wonderful fact with all the power of my mind. Somehow or"
"other it did not seem real, but I felt I could make it real by an effort"
of the will.
Streets and houses and moving people soon crowded the whole view. The
people filled me with intense curiosity. I longed to talk to them and
find out what they felt and thought about the war.
We entered Victoria Station. I opened the door of the compartment with
"hasty, trembling hands. I did not wait to change my French money, but"
hurried out into a street and got on to a 'bus.

"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Very curious indeed!"""
"""What is curious?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""Those marks,"" he answered, indicating them with his finger.  ""They are"
"very puzzling.  I've never seen such marks before."""
"""Do they point to foul play?""  I inquired, feeling suspicious that she"
had by some mysterious means fallen the victim of an assassin.
"""Well, no,"" he responded, after some hesitation; ""that is not my"
"opinion."""
"""Then what is your opinion?"""
"""At present I have none.  I can have none until I make a thorough"
"examination.  There are certainly no outward marks of violence."""
"""We need not inform the police, I suppose?"""
"""Not at present,"" he replied, his eyes still fixed upon the blanched"
face of the woman who had once been all the world to me.
"I raised her dead hand, and upon it imprinted a last fervent kiss.  It"
was cold and clammy to my lips.  In that hour all my old love for her
"had returned, and my heart had become filled with an intense bitterness"
"and desolation.  I had thought that all my love for her was dead, and"
"that Edith Austin, the calm, sweet woman far away in an English county,"
"who wrote to me daily from her quiet home deep in the woodlands, had"
"taken her place.  But our meeting and its tragic sequel had, I admit,"

Her perplexity was fast approaching alarm when we heard a muffled report

"Then, drawing a chair to the bedside, he seated himself, holding her"

there.
"""Have you no idea of the nature of the poison?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""None,"" he responded.  ""Ask me no questions now.  When we have brought"

strange in that?”
"“You are right,” said Cæsar; “whoever wants to learn, should. I have"
done so about financial questions.”
“Is it true that your brother knows all about questions of money?”
Kennedy asked Laura.
“He says so.”
“I haven’t much belief in his financial knowledge.”
“No?”

"“I will compass it. It is true that I want to be a philistine, but a"

This is a Burman allegory of Buddhism. It was told me long ago. I trust
I have not spoilt it in the retelling.
CHAPTER XXV
CONCLUSION
This is the end of my book. I have tried always as I wrote to remember
the principles that I laid down for myself in the first chapter. Whether
"I have always done so I cannot say. It is so difficult, so very"
"difficult, to understand a people--any people--to separate their beliefs"
"from their assents, to discover the motives of their deeds, that I fear"
I must often have failed.
My book is short. It would have been easy to make a book out of each
"chapter, to write volumes on each great subject that I have touched on;"
but I have not done so--I have always been as brief as I could.
"I have tried always to illustrate only the central thought, and not the"
"innumerable divergencies, because only so can a great or strange thought"
"be made clear. Later, when the thought is known, then it is easy to"
"stray into the byways of thought, always remembering that they are"
"byways, wandering from a great centre."
CHAPTER XIV
"""SALLIE HARRIS"""
Sallie's first startled impulse was to deny the new identity Slyne had
so glibly bestowed on her. It seemed too preposterous to be believable;
"and she was very suspicious of him. A little flushed, more than a little"
"afraid, and yet in some sense convinced in spite of herself by the"
outward and visible signs about her that all these strange happenings
"must have at least some foundation of fact, she sought to read the"
others' thoughts in their faces.
"The Marquis of Ingoldsby was gaping at her, in open wonder and"
"admiration. Slyne's features wore a subdued expression of triumph, and"
"Captain Dove's a dazed, incredulous frown. Mr. Jobling was beaming about"
"him, so apparently satisfied with her, so respectably prosperous-looking"
himself that her doubts as to Slyne's good faith began to give way. When
the lawyer was in turn presented to her and also addressed her by that
"new name, she could scarcely disclaim it."
"""You'll stay and have luncheon with us, Lord Ingoldsby?"" Slyne remarked,"
touching the bell; and his lordship left off gaping at Sallie to look
him over with all the solemn sagacity of a young owl in broad daylight.
"""Er--all right,"" his lordship at length agreed. ""Don't mind if I do."
"""Though I have some--er--friends waitin' for me,"" he added as an"
"machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square"
"metal plates everywhere. That is all I know."""
"Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two"
guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and
"contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the"
"piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly,"
commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue
eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on
with a mighty bound.
"""We have in ally in her,"" murmured Brand. ""Though God only knows if"
"that will mean anything to us...."""
CHAPTER IV
_In the Tower_
"""What I can't figure out,"" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare"
"room, ""is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor."
"They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they"
"could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it."""
"Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive"
study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive
"power. ""If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know"
better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar
magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions
difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.
"""As you say, _Mino-sama_,"" Ikeda bowed. ""I merely wanted to make you"
aware of my concern about the pilot. He should be monitored more
"closely from now on."""
"""Which is precisely what I intend to do."" Tanzan Mino's silver hair"
"seemed to blend with the sea beyond. ""There is an obvious solution."
"When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be alone."""
"""What are you suggesting? No one else--"""
"""Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable, then steps"
"must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with him."""
"""You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was designed to"
"accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the two"
"researchers."""
"""No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the Boeing. Then if"
"Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way, they will"
"be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is solved."" He"
"revolved back from the window. ""That will be all."""
"Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door. He"
"didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully in"
command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would
have to be started immediately.
"After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and activated a"
line of personal video monitors beside his desk.
"""Frankly, I haven't had time to read them. However, I think there is"
little doubt as to the mood of my people. They will be indignant and
"angry at Washington bungling."""
He pointed to another hand.
"""Senator, granting the details you outlined are accurate, have you any"
"knowledge as to--"""
"""Young man. _Every_ detail I outlined was completely accurate."" Senator"
Crane withered the reporter with a hostile look and pointed elsewhere.
"""Senator, did you consult with the people responsible for handling the"
"situation before making your speech?"""
"""I tried. I was willing to co-operate in every way, but my patience ran"
"out. Also, I was alarmed at the bungling and inefficiency I saw. For"
"that reason I went straight to the people with my story."""
"""Senator, I have a wire from the governor of your state. It just arrived"
in response to my query as to his attitude on this affair. The governor
"says, quote, _No comment_, unquote. Would _you_ care to comment on his"
"statement?"""
Senator Crane thought he heard a faint ripple of mirth drift across the
"room. But, of course, he had to be mistaken. ""I think the governor"
replied wisely. I expect to return home and confer with him as soon as
"possible."""
"""Senator, can you explain why, out of all the able, sincere officials in"
"Washington, D.C., elected or otherwise, you were the only one with"

"“Now, these ginks will be watching me every minute, waiting for a chance"
"to shoot. You may catch them off their guard directly and when you do,"
cut and run!”
“So that’s what you did all the talking for?” queried Jack.
"“You bet!” answered Frank. “And while you’re running, I’ll do a little"
sprinting myself.”
"“Here, you!” shouted the leader, almost lifting Frank’s feet from the"
ground as he dragged him away.
“What were you whispering to that boy?” demanded one of the others.
"“I was telling him,” Frank answered, making an insulting face, “that I"
used to have a dog that looked exactly like you.”
The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy with upraised fist. The
"leader blocked his rush by imposing his own burly form, and the two went"
"down together. The half-breeds sprang forward, too, the intention"
evidently being to assist their companion as against the leader.
"Frank let out a yell which might have been heard half a mile away, and"
"the three boys darted down the mountainside, followed by harmless shots"
from the guns of the half-breeds.
The incident had taken place on a rocky level flanked by steep slopes on
"each side. The place, in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into"
a long fifty percent grade.
"visible, and from a first shyness that did not lack charm he expanded"
"briskly. After visiting a ""dry"" café, to seal this fortunate"
acquaintanceship--as he insisted upon calling it--he warmed up to us and
"we to him, with the result that his bags were soon carried down and"
"stowed in our spare stateroom. Leaving him there, we went on deck."
"""Dragot,"" Tommy mused. ""Speaks with a slight accent, but I can't make"
"out what!"""
"""Roumanian, possibly,"" I suggested, ""as he comes from there."""
"""You rather excel yourself,"" he smiled. ""Registering from Roumania,"
"however, isn't prima facie evidence that he's a Roumanian."""
"""He's a clever little talker, all the same."""
"""Right O! Too clever. I'm wondering if we aren't a pair of chumps to"
"take him."""
"""Why?"""
"""He may be a crook, for all we know. Did you notice what he said about"
"holding a commission from Azuria, and then hurrying to explain that"
Azuria isn't on the ordinary maps--just a wee bit of a kingdom up in the
"Carpathians, yet in the confines of Roumania? I call that fishy!"""
"""Not entirely so, Tommy. When you said it might now be turning into a"
"republic, did you notice how proudly he declared that the descendants of"

"escaping the ravages of the Bulgarian army, they were stronger today"

the impression of a forceful man.
"Near them, at a table close by, was a little blond man, with a hooked"
"nose and a scanty imperial, in company with a fat lady. They bowed to"
Marchmont and his wife.
"“That gentleman looks like a Jew,” said Cæsar."
"“He is,” replied Marchmont, “that is Señor Pereyra, a rich Jew; of"
"Portuguese origin, I think.”"
“How quickly you saw it!” exclaimed Susanna.
"“He has that air of a sick goat, so frequent in Jews.”"
"“His wife has nothing sickly about her, or thin either,” remarked Laura."
"“No,” said Cæsar; “his wife represents another Biblical type; one of"
"the fat kine of somebody’s dream, which foretold abundance and a good"
harvest.”
"The Englishman, Kennedy, had also little liking for Jews."
"“I do not hate a Jew as anti-Christian,” said Cæsar; “but as"
"super-Christian. Nor do I hate the race, but the tendency they have"
"never to be producers, but always middlemen, and because they incarnate"
"so well for our era the love of money, and of joy and pleasure.”"
"The English author was a great partisan of Jews, and he asserted that"
they were more distinguished in science and the arts than any other
"race. The Jewish question was dropped in an instant, when they saw a"
smart lady come in accompanied by a pale man with a black shock of hair
"""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here"
"yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!"""
"""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who"
"had taken my shape!"""
Then she gradually came to her senses; but not until long afterward was
"she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that"
"her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been"
"there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that"
"they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their"
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day.
NOTE
Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor
"dairy-maid in ""The Troll Wedding"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I,"
"p. 50. From Hadeland, told by a _Signekjarring_, a kind of wise"
woman or herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll
magic and witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the
place where it is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to
"its original form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like"
"to turn into skeins of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly"
away.

"""Bli' me! Won't that labor crowd be hot? They nearly bashed in my head"

The sputter of the craft alongside was now punctuated by such a volley
"of curses that he raised his voice again: ""Belay that chatter, will"
"you? There's a lady aboard."""
arrival of another squadron from Centauri. He found himself busy
readjusting the search pattern to accommodate this new contingent.
He eyed the pattern in the stereo and hoped it was good enough.
*       *       *       *       *
There was the basic aggregate of nine full squadrons spread out flat in
a space lattice that ran back and forth from narrow end to wide end of
the cone of probability. There was one full squadron of roving ships
"that went aimlessly back and forth across the pattern, just to cope"
with the happenstance factor.
One squadron was parked at either end of the search grid as space
"markers, with a computer ship at either end to maintain a constant"
check on their space coordinates. The big search pattern shuttled from
"one end to the other, and if they came back to miss the marker ships,"
they retraced their path so that no space went uncombed.
The infrawave chattered and Space Admiral Stone was calling for
Commodore Theodore Wilson.
"""How're you coming?"""
"Wilson replied, ""We're still at it, Admiral. So far we haven't seen"
"her."""
"""Don't forget, Wilson, there's more lost out there than the woman you"
"want."""
"Ted wanted to snap back angrily, but all he said was, ""You don't mind"
"if I take this search personally, do you, Admiral Stone? I'm not"
heard from the crippled dwarf.
"""It has nothing to do with you,"" she repeated; ""it is a matter of the"
"Gitanos!"""
"But there came up from the bottom of the ravine, the lantern-jawed"
"Sergeant, long, silent, lean, parched as a Manchegan cow whose pasture"
has been burnt up by a summer sun. With one beckoning finger he summoned
"La Giralda apart, and she obeyed him as readily as the boy had obeyed"
"her. They communed a long time together, the old gipsy speaking, the"
coffee-coloured Sergeant listening with his head a little to the side.
At the end of the colloquy Sergeant Cardono went directly up to Rollo
and saluted.
"""Is it permitted for me to speak a word to your Excellency concerning"
"the objects of the expedition?"" he said, with his usual deference."
"""Certainly!"" answered Rollo; ""for me, my mission is a secret one, but I"
"have no instructions against listening."""
The Sergeant bowed his head.
"""Whatever be our mission you will find me do my duty,"" he said; ""and"
"since this cursed plague may interfere with all your plans, it is well"
that you should know what has befallen and what is designed. You will
pardon me for saying that it takes no great prophet to discover that our
"purposes have to do with the movements of the court."""
Rollo glanced at him keenly.
"""Did General Cabrera reveal anything to you before your departure?"" he"
The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its
appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious
"destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of"
them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to
Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.
"""Red spot one mile ahead, altitude forty thousand feet,"" reported"
Brand.
He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far
"below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the"
ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red
firelight.
"Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding"
"wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast"
"crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous"
signal.
"Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the"
scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.
"""We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,"" he said."
"""No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a"
"little."""
Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast
distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles
they knew it extended.
"""We're right on it now,"" called Brand. ""Right on it--we're going over"
"the edge--we're--"""
"“How’s this, are you leaving already, father?” said Simonetta, as he"
went through the shop to get to the street.
"“I’m coming back, I’m coming back right away.”"
_SUPERSTITIONS_
"The three of them went to a rather dirty tavern in the same lane,"
and settled themselves by the window. This post was a good point of
"observation for that narrow street, so crowded and so picturesque."
"Workmen went by, and itinerant vendors, women with kerchiefs, half"
"head-dress and half muffler, and with black eyes and expressive faces."
"Opposite was a booth of coloured candies, dried figs strung on a reed,"
and various kinds of sweets.
"A wine-cart passed, and Kennedy made Cæsar observe how decorative it"
"was with its big arm-seat in the middle and its hood above, like a"
prompter’s box.
Giovanni Battista ordered a flask of wine for the three of them. While
"he chatted and drank, friends of his came to greet them. They were men"
"with beards, long hair, and soft hats, of the Garbaldi and Verdi type so"
abundant in Italy.
"Among them were two serious old men; one was a model, a native of"
"Frascati, with the face of a venerable apostle; the other, for contrast,"
"looked like a buffoon and was the possessor of a grotesque nose, long,"
thin at the end and adorned with a red wart.
"Monsieur considered this a great joke, exclaiming:"
"""It is not so much as that! She is but three--to me, always three! Yet,"
"as you say, I might better find her with you than anywhere! A despairing"
"search, my boys!"""
Tommy's eyes were twinkling as he murmured sympathetically:
"""If it's a three-year-old you want, there's a place in Havana called"
"'Casa de Beneficencia Maternidad,' where furtive-eyed damsels leave"
"kiddies at twilight, ring the doorbell, and beat it. You might pick up"
"one there, as a last resort."""
"""But--but,"" Monsieur began to sputter, when I threw an orange at Tommy,"
"explaining to our agitated guest that he was a cut-up devoid of ideas,"
really an intellectual outcast.
"""Well,"" he cried, seeming to exude pleasure, ""I will stay with you a"
"while, eh? Maybe we can teach him something--this cut-upping Tommy of"
"yours!"""
"He had fallen in with our scheme most agreeably, and later Tommy"
confided to me that he was glad we wouldn't have to sit on the old
fellow's head.
"Passing that afternoon beneath Morro Castle, the _Whim_ tacked prettily"
through the entrance of Havana harbor and in another scant two miles
dropped anchor.
"Havana Bay is a dancing sheet of water, as bright as the skies and"
hardly less contagious than the city's laughter. But when one drops
in lockers for a while without speaking. Then he spoke slowly and
deliberately.
"""It strikes me that when I was an officer of the bodyguard, in the"
"service of the late Fernando the Seventh, my right royal namesake (and"
"in some sort predecessor), there was another room used for the private"
stores and pieces of the officers. If I mistake not it was entered by
"that door to the right, but the key appears to be wanting!"""
"He added the last clause, as he watched the frantic efforts of Rollo,"
"who had immediately thrown himself upon the panels, while the Señor was"
in the act of rolling out his long-drawn Castilian elegances of
utterance.
"""Hither, Cardono,"" cried Rollo, ""open me this door! Quick, Sergeant!"""
"""Have a care,"" said the Duke; ""there is powder inside!"""
"But Rollo, now keen on the scent of weapons of defence, would not admit"
"a moment's delay, and the Sergeant, inserting his curiously crooked"
"blade, opened that door as easily as he had done the French window."
Muñoz stepped forward with some small show of eagerness and glanced
within.
"""Yes,"" he said, ""the officers' arms are there, and a liberal allowance"
"of powder."""
"""They are mostly sporting rifles,"" said Rollo, looking them over, ""but"
"there is certainly plenty of powder and ball."""
"""And what kills ibex and bouquetin on the sierras,"" drawled Muñoz, ""will"

"A Bill to Consolidate, with Amendments, the Enactments"
relating to Naval Prize of War.
Whereas at the Second Peace Conference held at The Hague in the year
"nineteen hundred and seven a Convention, the English translation whereof"
"is set forth in the First Schedule to this Act, was drawn up, but it is"
desirable that the same should not be ratified by His Majesty until such
amendments have been made in the law relating to naval prize of war as
will enable effect to be given to the Convention:
And whereas for the purpose aforesaid it is expedient to consolidate the
law relating to naval prize of war with such amendments as aforesaid and
with certain other minor amendments:
"Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and"
"with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and"
"Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of"

"and shall, on the high seas, and throughout His Majesty's Dominions, and"
"in every place where His Majesty has jurisdiction, have all such"

I flattered myself that we had all done a neat bit of convincing lying in
a good cause.
"""Odds fish!"" mumbled the king, pulling his chin beard, evidently puzzled."
"""Odds fish!"" exclaimed Frances, mimicking the king's tone of voice and"
"twisting an imaginary beard. ""Some one has been hoaxing Jacob Hall's"
"friend."""
"It was a bold speech, but Frances carried it off splendidly by turning to"
the king and speaking in mock seriousness:--
"""Your Majesty should put a check on Rochester and the wags. It is a shame"
to permit them to work upon the credulity of one who is growing weak in
"mind by reason of age."""
"The country girl had vanquished the terror of the court, and all who had"
"witnessed the battle rejoiced; that is, all save the king and Castlemain."
"She glared at Frances, and her face, usually beautiful despite the lack"
"of youth, became hideous with rage. She was making ready for another"
"attack of words, if not of finger nails, when the duchess interposed,"
saying:--
"""Evidently some one has been hoaxing you, Lady Castlemain. Mistress"
Jennings was not kidnapped Sunday nor any other day. She has been with
"me constantly of late, excepting Sunday after four o'clock, and she has"
"accounted for herself from that time till her return to my closet."""
"Castlemain was whipped out, so she turned the whole matter off with a"
"forced laugh, saying:--"
"""Absolutely."""
"""It would, moreover, not be possible for anyone to enter or leave"
"without your knowledge?""  I suggested."
"""M'sieur understands me perfectly.  Mademoiselle must have fallen to the"
"floor lifeless immediately after I had let you out.  She made no sound,"
"and had Jean not entered with her letters, which the concierge had"
"brought, my poor young mistress might be lying there now."""
The average Frenchwoman of the lower class is always dramatic wherever a
"domestic calamity is concerned, and this worthy bonne was no exception."
She punctuated all her remarks with references to the sacred personages
of the Roman Catholic religion.
"""You haven't searched the room, I suppose?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Madame gave orders that nothing was to be touched."""
This reply was eminently satisfactory.  I glanced again around the
"place, now dim in the falling twilight, and ordered her to throw back"
the sun-shutters.
"The woman went to the window and opened them, admitting a flood of"
"mellow light, the last crimson of the glorious afterglow.  Up from the"
"boulevard came the dull roar of the traffic, mingling with the sound of"
"distant bells ringing the Ave Maria.  The bonne--an Alsatian, from her"
"accent--crossed herself from force of habit, and retreated towards the"
door.
"""You may go,"" I said.  ""I will remain here until the doctor arrives."""
into a better channel.[23] Such stories are so easy to recognise that
"it would be useless to make a formal list, but I shall make further"
allusion to this in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.
"These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of"
material suitable for normal children. Much might be added in the way
"of detail, and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to"
avoid one class of story more than another; but this care belongs to
another generation of teachers and parents.

suddenly swarmed with bearded and grotesque forms. They did not
recognize in Francesco the monk who had spent a night in their midst.
"The goatherd had maliciously disappeared, as if to revenge himself for"
his interrupted orisons. With glowering faces they thronged around

Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper headings
which catch the eye of children in the streets and appeal so powerfully
to their imagination.

"look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form some"
idea of the effect upon their imagination.
"Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should"
hasten to say that this influence is very far from being altogether
bad. There are possibilities of romance in street life which may have
just the same kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting
stories. I am indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover (Hon. Sec. of the National

was convincingly loud and wrathful as he replied:

"""I'll make good your losses,"" Emerson volunteered, quickly, realizing"
that other ears were open.
"so, never fear. No power on earth could make me take up the old life"

The Girl said nothing in reply; instead she put both her arms around his
"neck and remained a long time in his embrace. At last, summoning up all"
"her fortitude she put him resolutely from her, and whispered:"
"""When you are ready, come. You must leave me now."" And with a curt"

CHAPTER VI
RETRIBUTION
Beneath the dark cornices of a thicket of wind-stunted pines stood a
"small company of men, looking out into the hastening night. The"
"half-light of evening lay over the scene, rolling wood and valley into"
"a misty mass, while the horizon stood curbed by a belt of heavy"
"thunder-clouds. In the western vault, a vast rent in the wall of gray"
shot out a blaze of translucent gold that slanted like a spear shaft
to a sullen sea.
The walls of Astura shone white and ghostly athwart the plains.
Sea-gulls came screaming to the cliffs. Presently out of the blue
"bosom of an unearthly twilight a vague wind arose. Gusts came,"
"clamored, and died into nothingness. The world seemed to shudder. A"
red sword flashed sudden out of the skies and smote the hills. Thunder
"followed, growling over the world. The lurid crater of Vesuvius poured"
"gold upon the sea, whose hoarse underchant mingled with the fitful"
wind.
A storm came creeping black out of the west. The sea grew dark. The
forests began to weave the twilight into their columned halls. A
sudden gust came clamoring through the woods. The myriad boughs tossed
"and jerked against the sky, while a mysterious gloom of trees rolled"
back against the oncoming night.
"The men upon the hill strained their eyes towards the sea, where the"
"profession.""--Ibid."
Appendix Q.
"1. ""The five writers to whose genius we owe the first attempt at"
"comprehensive views of history were Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, Voltaire,"
"Hume, and Gibbon. Of these the second was but a cold believer in"
"Christianity, if, indeed, he believed in it at all; and the other four"
"were avowed and notorious infidels.""--Buckle."
"2 ""Here, then, we have the starting-point of progress--_scepticism_...."
"All, therefore, that men want is _no hindrance_ from their political and"
religious rulers.... Until common minds doubt respecting religion they
can never receive any new scientific conclusion at variance with it--as
"Joshua and Copernicus.""--Ibid."
"3. ""The immortal work of Gibbon, of which the sagacity is, if possible,"
"equal to the learning, did find readers, but the illustrious author"
"was so cruelly reviled by men who called themselves Christians, that"
"it seemed doubtful if, after such an example, subsequent writers would"
hazard their comfort and happiness by attempting to write philosophic
history. Middleton wrote in 1750.... As long as the theological spirit
"was alive nothing could be effected.""--Ibid."
"4. ""The questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a"
hundred years ago were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds
of years before that.... But the Church had known how to deal with
"intellectual insurgents, from Abelard in the twelfth century down to"
"Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated, and for the"
"Astura poured boiling pitch upon the heads of the attacking party,"
hurled rocks of huge dimensions down upon them which crushed into a
"mangled mass scores of men, unable to retain the vantage they had"
"gained under the avalanche of arrows, rocks and fire."
In a moment's time the situation was changed.
"Noiselessly as leopards, the duke's men fell upon their rear, raising"
"their war-cry as they leaped from the shadows. Those on the ramparts,"
"forced to grapple with the nearer enemy, abandoned their tasks. The"
"Pisans, profiting by the lull, swarmed over the walls. Taken between"
"two parties, a deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued. Above the din and"
"the roar of the hurricane, of the clashing of arms, above the cries"
"of the wounded, the death-rattle of the dying, sounded the voice of"
the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Onward, my men! Kill and slay!"""
Side by side the duke and Francesco leaped into the thickest of the
"fray, both animated by the same desire to come face to face with the"
"lords of Astura, spurning a lesser enemy."
For a time they seemed doomed to disappointment. Had the Frangipani
been slain?
The zest of the conflict pointed rather to their directing the
defence. Else their mercenaries would have left Astura to its fate.
Suddenly an unearthly voice startled the combatants.

THE ART OF PRESCRIBING
The prescription should be as brief and simple as possible. It should be
explicit and clearly written. It may be expressed either in Latin or in
English. The manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
"specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic regulations"
or diet of the patient are sometimes necessary.
Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the following four
representative constituents: (1) The _basis_ or active ingredients. The
practice of conjoining several active medicines has wisely been
"abandoned. Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give"
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat different
"ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are more often effectually controlled"
by the conjunction of a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium
than by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by either
morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving them together. (2)
"The _adjuvant_ is introduced in order to increase, moderate or modify"
the action of the basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure
solubility and ready absorption. (3) A _corrective_ is occasionally

and Francesco loosened the sword in the scabbard anticipating an
"ambush, when he pushed it back with a puzzled look. Before a wayside"
"shrine, almost entirely concealed by weeds, there knelt a grotesque"
figure at orisons. He either had not heard the tramp of Francesco's
"steed, or ignored it on purpose, for not until the latter called to"
"him did he turn, and with much relief Francesco recognized his former"
guide from the camp of the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Where is the camp of the duke?"" he queried curtly, impatient with the"
man's exhibition of secular godliness.
"""Many miles away,"" replied he of the goat's-beard, as he arose and"
kissed a little holly-wood cross that he carried.
"""Lead me to it!"""
"The godly little man flopped again, scraped some dust together with"
"his two hands, spat upon it, then smeared his forehead with the stuff,"
uttering the names of sundry saints.
Francesco had come to the end of his patience.
"""Get up, my friend,"" he said, ""we have had enough praying for one"
"day!"""
"The goatherd offered to anoint him with dust and spittle, pointing a"
"stumpy forefinger, but Francesco was filled with disgust. He caught"
the man by the girdle and lifted him to his feet.

"temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual.” To those who"
"wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for their"
encouragement the following lines from Whitcomb Riley:
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN.[39]
"Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,"
When the robbers came to rob him;
"And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,"
The robbers who came to rob him--
"They picked the lock of the palace-gate,"
Seized his jewels and gems of State
"His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--"
The robbers that came to rob him.
But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
For of what had the robbers robbed him?
"Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,"
"When the robbers came to rob him,--"
They robbed him not of a golden shred
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
"“And they're welcome to all things else,” he said,"
When the robbers came to rob him.
"There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a"
"delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things"
"for small children, to be found in our old Nursery Rhymes. I quote from"
the following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the _Nation_.
After speaking on the subject of Fairy Stories being eliminated from
"the school curriculum, the writer adds:"
We all tried in vain to stand with heels and back to the inside of the
north wall on the ground floor--it cannot be done; one falls forward
at once. From the top there is a magnificent view of the city and the
"surrounding plain, of the mountains on the east and the sea on the"
"west, of the city of Leghorn and the island of Elba."
From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for the first time the
red gold of ripe oranges shining amid their dark green leaves in the
"gardens, and rejoiced to think that at last we had reached a somewhat"
"milder climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us."
"The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the schedule was such"
that we did not arrive till late at night. From the car windows we had
"some impressive views of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the"
"solemn campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at midnight,"
and passed through the breach in the walls which has been made for the
"railway, feeling, perhaps even more deeply than is usual, the thrill"
with which all travellers except those who are utterly devoid of
imagination first enter the Eternal City.

This is a vivid and powerful romance of the thirteenth century in the
"times of the great Ghibelline wars, and deals with the fortunes of"
"Francesco Villani, a monk, who has been coerced by his dying father to"
"bind himself to the Church through a mistaken sense of duty, but who"
"loves Ilaria, one of the famous beauties of the Court at Avellino. The"

the story.

CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
"Not a word more was uttered between the two. La Giralda, for no reason"
"that she would acknowledge even to herself, had conceived an infinite"
"respect for Sergeant Cardono, and was ready to obey him implicitly--a"
fact which shows that our sweet Concha was over-hasty in supposing that
one woman in any circumstances can ever answer for another when there is
a man in the case.
But on this occasion La Giralda's submission was productive of no more
"than a command to go down into the town of San Ildefonso, the white"
"houses of which could clearly be seen a mile or two below, while the"
sergeant betook himself to certain haunts of the gipsy and the brigand
known to him in the fastnesses of the Guadarrama.
Like a dog La Giralda complied. She sharpened a stick with a knife which
"she took from a little concealed sheath in her leathern leggings, and"
with it she proceeded to quicken the donkey's extremely deliberate pace.
"Then with the characteristic cry of the goatherd, she gathered her flock"
together and drove them before her down the deeply-rutted road which led
"from the farmhouse. She had not proceeded far, however, when she"

"If an ewe gives birth to a beaver[82] (?), the king's land will"

"If an ewe gives birth to a fox, Enlil[83] will maintain the rule of"
"the legitimate king for many years, or[84] the king will strengthen"
his power.
"If an ewe gives birth to a Mukh-Dul[85], the enemy will carry away"

"ruin, the dynasty will be opposed, confusion in the land."
"If an ewe gives birth to a panther, the kingdom of the ruler will"
secure universal sway.
"If an ewe gives birth to a hyena (?), approach of Elam."
"If an ewe gives birth to a gazelle, the days of the ruler through the"

that held him to his seat.
"""Boat's done for, sir,"" announced one of the would-be crew. Such was"
the case. The explosion of a shell had wrenched her keel and
garboards out of her.
"""Then overboard with that!"" ordered Terence, indicating a Carley"
"life-buoy, which, though scorched by the blast of the shells, was"
still practically intact.
"The Carley life-buoy is a ""new departure"" in life-saving appliances"
on board ships of the Royal Navy. It is a glorified edition of an
"ordinary buoy, but elongated in shape and provided with gratings, and"
capable of being propelled by oars.
Half a dozen bluejackets seized the huge buoy and slung it overboard.
Held by means of a line it floated alongside the cruiser until
Terence and three men clambered into it.
Although the rate of propulsion was not by any means so rapid as that
of a boat the progress of the rescuers was far from slow. More than
once they were splashed by the spray thrown up by a ricochetting
"projectile, as the German gunlayers were gradually correcting their"
"aim, yet unscathed the rescue party came alongside the gradually"
sinking seaplane.

The airman was Waynsford. In his pneumatic helmet and huge goggles he

"If a foetus[54] lacks the right ear, the rule of the king will come"
"to an end, his palace will be destroyed, overthrow of the elders of"
"the city, the king will be without counsellors, confusion in the"

control[55].
"If the foetus lacks a left ear, a god will harken to the prayer of"
"the king, the king will take the land of his enemy, the palace of the"
"enemy will be destroyed, the enemy will be without a counsellor, the"
"cattle of the enemy's country will be diminished, the enemy will lose"

brown filiform ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
"and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground, this being the"
form in which it is usually used.

OLEUM ANISI--OIL OF ANISE
A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless or pale yellow, thin and strongly refractive"
"liquid, having the characteristic odor of anise, and a sweetish, mildly"
aromatic taste. Specific gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an
equal volume of alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs"
"and cats, 1 to 5 m."
"ACTIONS.--Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic and carminative. It"
"is used to relieve indigestion and flatulence, to communicate an"
"agreeable flavor to many medicines, and to diminish the griping of"
purgatives. Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.
USES.--The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or alcohol to kill
"fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin; and one drop of the pure"
oil may be placed on the feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice.
"The oil of anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of drugs,"
and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant properties.
horizon. Then he pointed with his holly staff to a blue hill that rose
against the eastern sky.
"""How far?"" queried Francesco."
The goatherd was anointing himself with spittle.
"""Each mile in these parts grows more evil,"" he said, tracing the sign"
"of the cross. ""It behooves a Christian to be circumspect!"""
Francesco prodded him with his scabbard.
"""How far?"""
"""Some ten leagues,"" replied the gnome. ""The day is clear, and the"
"place looks nearer than it is!"""
"It occurred to Francesco that there must be some human abode close by,"
"as the goatherd, entirely familiar with the region, would not wander"
too far from habitations of the living. And upon having made known his
"request, the little man preceded him at a lively pace. At a lodge in"
"the forest deeps they halted, and here Francesco and his guide rested"
"during the hot hours of noon, partaking of such food as the liberality"
"of their host, an old anchorite, set before them."
"After men and steed had rested, they set out anew."
"The goatherd's inclination to invoke untold saints, whenever there"
"seemed occasion and whenever there was not, was curbed by a hard line"
"round Francesco's lips, and they plunged into the great silence. A"
"sense of green mystery encompassed them, as they traversed the green"
forest-aisles. The sky seemed to have receded to a greater distance.
"Minna--she raved over the judicial murder of this Belgian heroine,"
"who was shot, as was Edith Cavell, for nothing more than assisting"
young Belgians to escape from German-occupied Belgium.
"She witnessed the air-raids of the Allies, when only comforting"
"papers were dropped on Brussels city, but bombs on the German"
aerodromes outside; and she also saw the Germans turn their guns
from the aeroplanes--which soared high out of their reach or skimmed
"below range--on to thickly-inhabited streets of the poorer quarters,"
to teach them to cheer the air-craft of the Allies!
"She beheld--or she was told of--many acts of rapine, considered"
cruelty and unreasoning ferocity on the part of German officials or
soldiers; yet saw or heard of acts and episodes of unlooked-for
"kindness, forbearance and sympathy from the same hated people. Von"
"Giesselin, after all, was a not uncommon type; and as to Minna von"
"Stachelberg, she was a saint of the New Religion, the Service of"
Man.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BOMB IN PORTLAND PLACE
Mrs. Rossiter said to herself in 1915 that she had scarcely known a
"happy day, or even hour, since the War began. In the first place"
Michael had again shown violence of temper with ministers of state
"over the release from prison of ""that"" Miss Warren--""a convict doing"
"a sentence of hard labour."" And then, when he had got her released,"
is the one common to all tropical countries on which Benjamin Kidd laid
an unerring finger when he referred to the unwisdom of longer permitting
the riches of the tropics to “remain undeveloped with resources running
to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency”. The
Panamanian authorities are making apparently sincere endeavors to
attract new settlers of greater efficiency. In proportion to the success
that attends the efforts the future of Panama will be bright.

CHAPTER XVI
THE INDIANS OF PANAMA
While that portion of the Panama territory that lies along the border of
Colombia known as the Darien is rather ill-defined as to area and to
"boundaries, it is known to be rich in timber and is believed to possess"
gold mines of great richness. But it is practically impenetrable by the
white man. Through this country Balboa led his force on his expedition
"to the unknown Pacific, and was followed by the bloodthirsty Pedrarias"
who bred up in the Indians a hatred of the white man that has grown as
the ages passed. No expedition can enter this region even today except
"Pteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age."
Their papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great
numbers from this time on.
"Cephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started"
"into existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the"
"Cambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the"
"allied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,"
"and tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The"
"animal lived in the ""body chamber"" at the larger end, and walled"
off the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of
"the shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the"
body chamber to the closed tip of the cone.
"The seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects"
the most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been
"so numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because"
"of their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,"
that better than any other group of organisms they can be used to
correlate the strata of different regions and to mark by their
slow changes the advance of geological time.
CLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries
"contains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in"
later periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar
regions.

"as, until I could reach Robat, I had no knowledge at all as to the"
strength and composition of the force that would be at my disposal.
But upon one thing I made up my mind--even at that early stage--I
"would do my utmost to show these Raiders, who were doing us so much"
"harm, that they could not do this with impunity. The lesson once"
"driven home, an endeavour should be made to become friendly with"
"them, to win them back to our side, and, so to speak, appoint them as"
doorkeepers of the Baluchistan frontier; but doorkeepers with their
rifles pointed at our enemies instead of at ourselves.
In the midst of these meditations I found myself stumbling with
"fatigue, so, with a last look at the beauty of the night, I turned"
"indoors, and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and making up for the"
"""whiteness"" of the night before."

"On the third day we made good progress, fate being kind in helping us"
"to avoid the sandy pitfalls which had hitherto been our undoing, and,"
"by nightfall, we found ourselves approaching the post of Mushki-chah."
Here we found the road blocked with a number of camel caravans
CHAPTER XXVI
DEEP ROMANY
The news which Sergeant Cardono had to communicate was indeed fitted to
"shake the strongest nerves. If true, it took away from Rollo at once all"
hope of the success of his mission. He saw himself returning disgraced
"and impotent to the camp of Cabrera, either to be shot out of hand, or"
"worse still, to be sent over the frontier as something too useless and"
feeble to be further employed.
"Briefly, the boy's news as repeated by La Giralda to the Sergeant,"
informed Rollo that though the court was presently at La Granja and many
"courtiers in the village of San Ildefonso, the royal guards through fear"
"and hunger had mutinied and marched back to Madrid, and that the gipsies"
were gathering among the mountains in order to make a night attack upon
the stranded and forsaken court of Spain.
In the sergeant's opinion not a moment was to be lost. The object of the
"hill Gitanos was pure plunder, but they would think nothing of"
"bloodshed, and would doubtless give the whole palace and town over to"
"rapine and pillage. Themselves desperate with hunger and isolation, they"
had resolved to strike a blow which would ring from one end of Spain to
the other.
It was their intention (so the imp said) to kill the Queen-Regent and
"her daughter, to slaughter the ministers and courtiers in attendance, to"
The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he
expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
"being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small"
quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
"cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly."
On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
"the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening"
rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
"day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third"
and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
"accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the"
physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
"rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average"
"of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude"
"was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve"
"corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the"
end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
"up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England"
convalescent.

PLAN
The indexer should decide definitely in his mind just what his
"procedure is to be before actually beginning work. At first, it is well"
"to make the index too full rather than the reverse, as it is easier to"
"cut out than to fill in. Most important of all, he must be sure that"
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood before he attempts to
transcribe the idea. The character of the book to be indexed must be
"carefully considered, taking into account the class of people who will"
"probably consult it, and the lines on which they will probably seek"
information.
Judgment is required in deciding whether it is wise to choose the
exact words of the author or to condense the idea into other words.
"In technical books, the exact wording is sometimes essential, but"
otherwise it is more important to express the _idea_ than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.
Always prefer simple words and expressions to those which are unusual
and cumbersome.
Omit every unessential word.
"When the book being indexed is one written upon a specific subject,"
this main subject should not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
"some reference for which a searcher would look. Ordinarily, the"
Contents covers this point rather than the Index.
Bear in mind particularly the two extremes: the importance of
CHAPTER XVI
THE CAMBRIAN
"THE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,"
"called the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has"
come down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first
"volume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the"
globe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the
"earlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed"
"have suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and"
"have been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the"
pre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate
the formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of
"the Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the"
history of the continents.
"Paleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured"
"by the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions"
of years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms
were very great. It is according to the successive stages in the
advance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five
"systems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the"
"DEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three"
"systems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they"
alike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;
"while the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and"
"""Stop him!"" yelled the commander."
"A dozen men hastened to comply, jolting against each other in their"
"alacrity to pursue the animal, which with marvellous agility had"
gained the extremity of the signal yard-arm.
"Here he perched, hanging on with his hind paws while he tasted each"
coin with his teeth--at first with an expression of hopefulness upon
his features that rapidly changed into one of profound disgust.
Holding the rest of the coins against his chest Mephisto hurled one
on to the sacred precincts of the quarter-deck. It landed in one of
"the compartments of the pay-table, displacing a sovereign, that"
rolled between the staff-paymaster and the assistant-paymaster.
Both officers simultaneously stooped to recover the errant piece of
gold. The result was that their heads met with a thud in spite of the
protection afforded by their peaked caps.
"Several of the men could not conceal a grin. One broke into a laugh,"
and meeting the stern glance of the commander tried to side-track
into a painful cough.
Fortunately for the culprit the commander was inwardly affected by a
"similar complaint, for he, too, saw the humour of the business."
"""Confound you!"" shouted the staff-paymaster, removing his cap and"
"rubbing his bald head. ""Confound you, you brute! Throwing away the"
"money from the public chest!"""
"The only reply from Mephisto was another penny that, thrown with"
to be blamed as her sins?
"To me the Yellow Peril cry, which is so often revived in some quarters"
"of the Continent, is either a sort of what we call 'guchi,' that is to"
"say, useless repetition of complaint of some unreasonable"
"disappointment, or a perpetuation of wicked instigation and selfish"
"intention. In either case, it is not at all a laudable action; indeed, I"
may say it is wasteful calumny for no material good will come of it
inasmuch as its object can never be achieved from the very condition of
the world. The people who entertain that idea would be doing far better
"service to their country, to the progress of civilisation, to the"
"general cause of humanity, if only they put aside such a silly notion,"
and busy themselves in teaching their fellow country-folks to accustom
themselves to the changed circumstances of the time. It would be a far
"more manly and noble act if they revised their old notions, which in a"
measure may be called prejudice.
"As to ourselves, the Japanese, we shall only be glad if we can enjoy a"
"peaceful and harmonious life in the happy family of the world, as we are"
"determined to do, in spite of all the obstacles which may be laid before"
us.

"dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very seldom given internally;"
"hypodermically, one-half this dose. By inhalation, same as given"
internally. It should be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.
"ACTIONS.--It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly dilates the"
arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats; causes a sense of
"fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall of blood pressure due to"
"dilation of the arterioles, lowering of temperature; when the vapor is"
applied direct to muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely
arrests its functional activity; it depresses the nervous system and
unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause death by respiratory failure.
USES.--Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its being inhaled;
"spasmodic asthma, used either internally, hypodermically or best by"
"inhalation; in strychnine poisoning, angina pectoris in tetanus, and as"
a heart stimulant. It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about

"ORIGIN.--The anise plant is a native of Egypt and the Levant, but has"
been introduced in various parts of that continent. It is also
cultivated occasionally in the gardens of this country. The fruit is
"abundantly produced in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence it"
"is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central and Southern Russia."
"DESCRIPTION.--Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5 m. m. long; carpels"
usually cohering and attached to a slender pedicel; grayish or
This was written by Erasmus to a member of the University of Leipzig in
December 1520. This one-sided and academic conception of the great
"events, a conception which arose in the study of a recluse bending over"
"his books, did more than anything else to prevent Erasmus from"
understanding the true nature and purport of the Reformation.
CHAPTER XVI
FIRST YEARS OF THE REFORMATION
Beginning of the relations between Erasmus and Luther--
"Archbishop Albert of Mayence, 1517--Progress of the"
Reformation--Luther tries to bring about a _rapprochement_ with
"Erasmus, March 1519--Erasmus keeps aloof; fancies he may yet act"
as a conciliator--His attitude becomes ambiguous--He denies ever
more emphatically all relations with Luther and resolves to
remain a spectator--He is pressed by either camp to take
"sides--Aleander in the Netherlands--The Diet of Worms,"
"1521--Erasmus leaves Louvain to safeguard his freedom, October"
1521
"About the close of 1516, Erasmus received a letter from the librarian"
"and secretary of Frederick, elector of Saxony, George Spalatinus,"
written in the respectful and reverential tone in which the great man
was now approached. 'We all esteem you here most highly; the elector has
all your books in his library and intends to buy everything you may
publish in future.' But the object of Spalatinus's letter was the
"execution of a friend's commission. An Augustinian ecclesiastic, a great"
"They indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,"
"temperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center"
of dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their
"migration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of"
the same system in different countries implies the absence of such
barriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic
fossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine
shells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India
and in the southern extremity of South America. Since such
organisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and
"cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water"
"connection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the"
antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered
along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely
separated countries.
CHAPTER XV
THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS
THE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of
"the beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have"
"every reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of"
"the oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the"
"solar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of"
"cosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have"
been derived.
"economic principle, that is of the world of nature, of feeling, of"
"passion, as a positive grade of the spiritual process, will probably"
"be counted as Croce's greatest achievement, by those who shall be able"
to look back on his work with an ampler perspective. It is through
"it that his philosophy of the spirit, and in this philosophy, the"
"consciousness of our day, has taken possession of that other world, of"
"that persistent transcendance, which we call nature. In this direction"
"lies, undoubtedly, the future course of the thought of an age, to"
"which, in this afterglow of a great conflagration, all problems seem to"
"gather into the one of the subjection to its better and higher self,"
"the utilization for its purer purposes, of its own cumbersome economic"
"body, of its nature and of its passions."
"[Footnote 1: Filosofia della Pratica, p. 208.]"
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
"Croce's Complete Works form a collection of twenty-eight volumes, in"
"four distinct series, published by Laterza e Figli, of Bari, who are"
"also the publishers of _La Critica_, and of the following collections"
"initiated or directed by Croce: _Scrittori d'Italia, Scrittori"
"Stranieri, Classici della Filosofia Moderna._"
"We give here a full list of the _Opere di Benedetto Croce_, adding to"
"the title of each volume the year of the last available edition, the"
years of their composition having already been indicated in the text:
Champagne contains about 10 per cent of absolute alcohol and carbonic
"acid gas, which acts as a local sedative upon the stomach. Ale, stout"
"and beers contain from 4 to 8 per cent of alcohol, together with bitters"
and malt extracts.
Cider contains 5 to 9 per cent of absolute alcohol. Imported sherry (B.
P.) contains 15 to 20 per cent of absolute alcohol.
"Alcohol is the solvent most commonly employed in pharmacy, dissolving"
"alkaloids, resins, volatile oils, balsams, oleo-resins, tannin, sugar,"
some fats and fixed oils.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 6 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 3 oz.; dogs,"
2 dr. to 1 oz.
ACTIONS.--Alcohol is a cerebral excitant and finally becomes a
depressant and a narcotic poison.
"It is anesthetic, antiseptic, antiparasitic, rubefacient (if confined),"
"mild astringent, coagulate albumen; a local refrigerant by virtue of its"
"rapid evaporation, unless confined by bandage, oiled silk, etc., when it"
is absorbed by the tissues and causes a sensation of warmth.
In medical doses it is a powerful general stimulant; it is very
"diffusible, and is partly oxidized by the organism, and partly excreted;"
thus alcohol acts as a food.
"Small doses relax the blood vessels, stimulate the gastric glands,"
promote appetite and digestion; lessen the elimination of waste
"products, by preventing rapid tissue waste; causes a feeling of warmth,"
"and temporarily, though slightly, raises the body temperature. It"
"ACTIONS.--Salicylic acid, sodium salicylate and phenyl salicylate are"
"powerful antiseptic, anti-rheumatic, diaphoretic, cardiac depressant,"
antiferment and antipyretic. Salicylic acid is in addition irritant and
"astringent, continued in large doses is apt to derange digestion; best"
to be administered on a full stomach.
"USES.--For acute rheumatism, influenza, strangles and purpura where"
"there is much sloughing; also as a surgical wash, salicylic acid one"
"part, borax one part to thirty or forty parts of water. Salicylic acid"
is a more powerful antiseptic than carbolic acid. Salicylic of soda is
freely antiseptic. Salicylic acid is highly recommended in intestinal
"flatulence, given in two drachm doses with one ounce of aromatic spirits"
"of ammonia. In gastric-flatulence give two drachms in capsule, repeat in"
half hour if necessary.
ACONITUM--ACONITE--MONKSHOOD
"DERIVATION.--Aconite is obtained from the root of aconitum napellus,"
"which grows in Northwestern North America, Europe and Asia in"
"mountainous regions, and cultivated in the United States for its"
beautiful flowers.
"PROPERTIES.--The fresh leaves have a faint narcotic odor, most sensible"
"when they are rubbed. Their taste is at first bitterish and herbaceous,"
"afterwards burning and acrid, with a feeling of numbness and tingling on"
"the inside of the lips, tongue and fauces, which is very durable,"
lasting sometimes many hours. When long chewed they inflame the tongue.
"The dried leaves have a similar taste, but the acrid impression"
THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS. It is to the igneous rocks that
we may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas
"contain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no"
doubt this was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed
the original earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the
"metals have been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even"
the sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and
"other metals, but in this widely diffused condition they are"
wholly useless to man. The concentration which has made them
available is due to the interaction of many agencies. Earth
"movements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust, the intrusion"
"of heated masses, the circulation of underground waters, have all"
cooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins.
"While fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the"
latter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled
"by similar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as"
"limestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes"
"filled with metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and"
zinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous
"aquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case"
of some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New
Mexico.
PART III
HISTORICAL GEOLOGY
used internally for bloody urine (haematuria) and for open joints apply
the powdered alum to arrest the flow of joint oil (synovia). For
"catarrhal ophthalmia, after the acute stage, an alum lotion five grains"
to one ounce of water is very serviceable; for granular lids rub with a
crystal of alum. Alum should never be used too strong over the eye as it
seems to have the power of dissolving the cornea; a solution containing
ten grains of alum to the ounce of water may be used in canker of the
ear of dogs; also for leucorrhoea and prolapsus of the rectum; dried
"alum may be used as a caustic whenever a caustic is indicated, but is"
"not recommended for this purpose. For a powerful drying powder,"
especially useful when excessive granulation exists. It causes sloughing
of the dead tissues and is indicated when the use of the knife is
inadmissible.
AMYLIS NITRIS--AMYL NITRITE
"A liquid containing about 80 per cent of amyl nitrite, together with"
variable quantities of undetermined compounds.
DERIVATION.--Obtained through distillation of nitric and amylic alcohol.
Distillate purified by sodium carbonate.
"PROPERTIES.--A clear, yellow or pale yellow liquid, oily, very volatile,"
peculiar and very diffusive ethereal odor and a pungent aromatic taste.
"Insoluble in water, but soluble in all proportions in alcohol, ether and"
chloroform.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 15 ms.;"
which will certainly remain as the most lasting monument raised to the
memory of the poet on this occasion. This troubled peace cannot make
him deviate from the path of his appointed labour any more than the war
"could; in peace as in war, his duty is his daily task, here and to-day,"
and his confidence in the morality and usefulness of that work which is
"his work is as little shaken by the prophets of despair in peace, as"
it was by the messiahs of the promised land who were so loud above the
turmoil of war. He is probably now noting with a smile that the same
"men who talked of the war to end all wars, are now very busy preventing"
"our civilization from dying away; that is, building a peace in the"
"abstract, with programs and words, as they fought a war which was not"
"the war, but a phantasm of their imagination."
"[Footnote 1: _Contributo_, p. 74.]"
II. THE THEORY OF HISTORY
Two meanings of the word history--History as contemporary history--
"History and chronicle--The spirit as history--Philology, and"
philological history--Poetical and rhetorical history--Universal
history--The universality of history: history and philosophy--The
unity of thought--Philosophy as methodology--The positivity of
history--The humanity of history--Distinctions and divisions--The
history of nature.
"There are two meanings to the word history, in English as well as in"
"warrant, empower any person to enter any dockyard or other place within"
Her Majesty's dominions and inquire as to the destination of any ship
which may appear to him to be intended to be employed in the naval or
"military service of any foreign state at war with a friendly state, and"
to search such ship.
[Sidenote: Exercise of Powers of Secretary of State or Chief Executive
Authority.]
26. Any powers or jurisdiction by this Act given to the Secretary of
"State may be exercised by him throughout the dominions of Her Majesty,"
and such powers and jurisdiction may also be exercised by any of the
"following officers, in this Act referred to as the chief executive"
"authority, within their respective jurisdictions; that is to say,"
(1) In Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant or other the chief governor
"or governors of Ireland for the time being, or the chief"
secretary to the Lord Lieutenant:
(2) In Jersey by the Lieutenant Governor:
"(3) In Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark, and the dependent islands by"
the Lieutenant Governor:
(4) In the Isle of Man by the Lieutenant Governor:
(5) In any British possession by the Governor:
A copy of any warrant issued by a Secretary of State or by any officer
"authorised in pursuance of this Act to issue such warrant in Ireland,"
"the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man shall be laid before Parliament."

This was delightful.
It was an exceptionally tough looking game.
But we have a boy who refused to give up.
And that on the touchline proves to be a champion of responsibility.
- Brilliant.
- Tore is where he should be.
"And you can finally sleep, Stian, with a clear conscience."
- You're good at taking care of Tore.
- Yes very.
"Goodnight, Stian."

Uh-
"Give me a glass of water, and... drop a ice cube in it for flavor."
"Staff meeting, everybody!"
"Snake, Robot, podium duty."
Hey.
"Hey, Etch."
Draw!
Oh!
Got me again.
"Etch, you've been working on that draw."
Fastest knobs in the West.
"Got a staff meeting, you guys."
"Come on, let's go."
"Now, where is that..."
Oh.
"Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?"
"-How're you doin', Rex?"
-Were you scared?
Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
"I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it."
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
"Oh, hi, Bo."
Hi.
"I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock."
"Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'."
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
"Oh, yeah!"
"Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away."
-Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
"-Come on, come on."
Smaller toys up front.
"Hey, Woody, come on."
"Oh, thanks, Mike."
"Yeah, I've decided to do this."
I'm going all the way.
"In fact, today counts as our third date, so when I say I'm going all the way, I mean, I'm going to..."
- Mrs. Nunley.
Hi.
- Hi.
I just wanted to make sure I got to say hi to all the grandparents.
Oh.
"Unfortunately, my parents couldn't make it this year."
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
And you are...?
"Oh, I'm Christine Campbell."
I'm Ritchie's mom.
"- Oh, of course."
Hi.
- Hi.
We invited my father instead.
"Oh, fantastic."
And you must be...?
I'm also Christine.
His girlfriend.
"Oh, I see."
Which would make you...?
"I'm Ritchie's dad, her ex-husband."
Her boyfriend.
Hi.
"I know it sounds a little complicated, but I'm fine with it."
"It works for me, so nothing else really matters."
"- Oh, my God!"
- What?
I just thought of the greatest thing.
"NO, NO."
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING HERE.
"THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN HEDGE FUNDS,"
OR I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL MYSELF.
COME ON.
"I DO HAVE TO GO, THOUGH."
BEFORE THE WIFE THROWS A FIT.
COME ON.
"LISTEN, CONGRATS AGAIN."
- YEAH.
- YEAH.
- SEE YA.
- SEE YA.
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER.
YOU DID NOT!
"NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU."
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
"AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SAYING, COUNSELOR?"
I AM SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD JUST MOVE AROUND A BIT
BEFORE THE SEMESTER'S OVER.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO LAW SCHOOL THINKING
THAT THIS WHOLE OFFICE IS JUST ONE BORING SECTION.
WHAT IF I LIKE YOUR SECTION?
I STILL THINK IT'S A MISTAKE.
I DO.
YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT
"WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, WHAT MAKES YOUR RIGHTEOUS."
"ANGRY, EVEN."
AND YOU HAVE THIS FIGURED OUT?
ABSOLUTELY.
"GUYS THAT I TAKE DOWN HAVE NO REASON TO BREAK THE LAW,"
That's like the worst combination for you.
I know.
"Oh, just..."
I'm stuck.
"I'm sorry, Dale."
Jill...
You don't have to be sorry.
You just got a little wasted that's... all.
"Oh, I drank too much."
I'm never drinking again.
I've heard that one before.
I don't think he wants to marry me you guys.
And I'm getting married in three weeks.
Dale.
Don't worry about Drew right now.
"Just finish blowing chunks, ok?"
Why don't you go make sure everything's ok out there.
I'll stay here with Jill.
Ok.
"Listen, Hallie."
I'm really sorry.
Are we ok?
Yeah.
We're ok.
I said a lot of things I didn't mean.
I'm sorry.
"Jill, I'm so sorry."
Ok.
Look... what the cat dragged in.
Seven told me about your little...
surprise party.
It's your birthday so I wanted to come out.
That son of a bitch.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- This is Doyle.
I'm sittin' on Frog One.
"Yeah, I know that."
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.
"The Westbury, my ass!"
I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.
Now what the hell's goin' on up there?
I make him comin' out ofthe hotel.
He was free as a bird.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
"Yeah, well, uh..."
"Listen, I don't care how many bartenders you got that are sick."
"No, I'm not workin' thatjoint."
That's right.
"Same to ya, buddy."
Can I get a grape drink?
Watch the closing doors.
Son of a bitch!
Hi.
Can I have a round-trip ticket to Washington?
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.
Cash is $54.
Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Have a nice flight.
"- Yes, sir?"
- Round trip to Washington.

Hi.
"Um, yeah, I had a question."
How's your water quality here in Denver?
- Woman:
I wouldn't drink it.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
"- Well, uh, could I get, uh, a bottle of tonic water then?"
- Sure.
- With a glass of ice and a twist of lemon?
"- Sure, I'll send that right up."
- What was your name?
- Catherine.
- What is it?
I've always wanted a grandchild.
-And I a grandpa.
Senna...
Give grandpa a kiss.
We must find Jesse.
I told him that you two are my parents.
Shut up and listen.
Let him believe it's true.
Let him at least die happy.
Dad... it's me.
I'm a grandfather now.
I fired the rocket that burnt you.
It wasn't you.
It was the fire devil.
"Put him on a leash, son."
He's hallucinating.
Morphine often does that.
I want to be under the blue sky where the birds sing.
-I'll fix it.
How are you going to fix that?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Will he live till tomorrow?
-Maybe.
"Jesse, wait!"
Where are you going?
I have to find out why I became a firefighter.
There are no devils in you!
Jesse.
Look!
Good old Tinky Winky.
This is my piece of meat!
Dad?
What?
Is it morning?
You were asleep?
"Yeah, I was."
What's going on?
Well...
I wanted to talk about Ryan.
"Yeah, I know, it's cool."
We don't need to discuss it.
"Well, I think we do."
"I mean, I know you're upset, your mother and I are upset."
But our responsibility is... is to our family.
"Yeah, that's okay."
"No, I get it."
"I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
There's no need for sarcasm.
I'm not being sarcastic.
"Well, it's hard to tell sometimes."
Dad... it's okay.
Really.
When you want to talk about it...
"Yeah, I know."
You're the one to talk to.
Got it.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
"Come on, Seth."
"Okay, got it."
"I'll be there in, like, 20 minutes."
Hey.

What's happening?
What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."
- I'm coming in!

We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.

NARRATOR:
He was brought across in 1228.
Preyed on humans for their blood.
"Selena, I don't want to wait that long."
I want to marry you now and become a lawyer too.
"Honey, don't cry."
It's nothing to cry about.
"Please go, Ted."
Just go.
Okay.
I guess I picked the wrong time.
"I'll come back tomorrow, when you're feeling better."
"Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Why, Nellie you didn't have to come to work today."
Work keeps my mind off of things.
"Selena's all right now, isn't she?"
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.
"Everything is just trouble, Mrs. MacKenzie."
Just trouble.
"Nellie, don't do any work today."
Just sit around and relax.
"Happy Labor Day, Mother."
Something's wrong.
She's upset.
"Can't blame her, with Lucas gone and nobody knows where he is."
I've gotta run.
Bye.
"- Hi, Norman."
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Come on.
"Hello, Mike."
Where'd you come from?
- Back there.
I'll beat you up!
Watch the teapot!
I don't need your advice!
I'm telling you
You...
"Get off, right?"
"Okay, I'll take your word"
Why are you pulling my clothes?
"Gao, are you really leaving?"
Y es!
But bear this in mind
"It's me who fired you, not vice versa!"
"Oh, you asshole!"
"Hi, is there some gold here on the road?"
It's you again!
Stay calm!
I just want to ask you something
Mind your head!
"Oh, you two are killing each other?"
Who exactly is your Brother Y an?
Y an Qingwang!
How come he stayed with Thunderstorm?
Say!
"Y es, yes!"
I'll tell you!
Brother Jin is killed!
"Y es, after Y an Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun"
He stayed at Thunderstorm's house
Dad!
"2nd Brother, 2nd Brother!"
"2nd Brother, don't you know me?"
I'm the one that's always bullied by you
I love this song uh.
It reminds me of being in Rome.
I wonder if toe sucking is big in Rome?
Baby you want a beer?
The six pack no?
"Baby, we have good energy."
We have a good energy me and you no?
Yes.
Come here...
Come dance with Papi.
Me and JP have been together on and off for about six months.
It's going pretty good but sometimes I get the feeling I'm not the only girl JP's seeing.
"Oh, JP..."
Ahhhh no no...
Are you still there?
Just stay here.
Who is that JP?
"Ah, computer is broken"
Is crazy joke ha ha...
No...
Come out where ever you are.
I only have eyes for you.
Hey JP!
Let's do that thing with the toes again.
Call me if you want to rendezvous.
Hey...
- Bye.
OK baby is no big deal is my massage therapist.
OK?
That's a reasonable explanation... right?
JP...
JP...
Where is he?
"Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter."
You seem to have plenty of company.
What do you mean?
"If I were you, I'd stay on this train and keep going."
What are you...
Oh!
Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
You're sorry.
Oh.
"Well, Gretchen, what happened to you?"
I found Nancy.
"What'd you do, have breakfast with her?"
I think you better not go in there.
Why?
"Well, she's sharing her drawing room with a man."
Nancy?
He was in bed when I walked in.
"Oh, there's some mistake."
"Yes, there's a mistake all right, and Nancy's made it."
"Gretchen, I think you've said about enough."
"Well, I saw him!"
You coming?
No.
Not until I hear Nancy's side of the story.
Uh-huh.
Drawing Room B. I'll see you at school.
"Aunt Nancy, I still have something on my mind."
(BELL BUZZING)
BOB:
Nancy.
May he do the same for you.
Have hope.
You deserve it.
PAULITO:
"La Primera lives, ese."
It lives through us.
It gives to us.
It is us.
"SimÃ²n, ese, it's all we got."
It's all we've ever had.
"Carnal, remember that time we went down to the L.A. River?"
"We drank that funky, funky wine, ese."
"Man, I was sick for a week."
You wanna know what Lourdes asked me?
I'm telling you this 'cause you're my carnal.
"She wanted to know if the reason why they call me ""Little Puppet"" was..."
You know.
Made me real angry.
I think she's pregnant now.
"I guess I showed her, huh?"
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.
Don't fight.
"Please, don't fight!"
J ust die!
J ust die.
Mi carnalito.
God damn me.
Coming out?
Paulito.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Your brother sent this for you.
"Yahoo, ya motherfucker!"
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
Shot in the foot.
He's fine.
So he got shot in the foot.
"What is it, a big fuckin' deal?"
"Vito, get a towel."
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
"Don't get me upset, now."
"Don't make a big fuckin' thing out of it, Spider!"
Ya little prick.
You trying to make me think what I did here.
It was an accident.
Fuck him.
Little fucking actor.
-You in?
-l'm in.
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
"Karen, will you grow up!"
Stop.
I'm still gonna go out!
"Not without your car keys, you're not."
Are you nuts?
What's your problem?
There's just you left.
"Mu Yeol, wake up!"
You can't sleep!
Mu Yeol!
Mu Yeol!
"It's so cold, just leave me behind."
The submarine is here.
Hold on.
What's the matter?
"They're shooting, why are they shooting?"
"We're on the same side, so why?"
We're not enemies.
Mu Yeol!
Mu Yeol!
"I've been stabbed,"
I'm not going to make it.
You've got to survive.
I'll leave Kyeong Hee and my son in your care.
You live on and take care of them for me.
Kid.
Mu Yeol!
Mu Yeol!
Mu Yeol!
"I love you, my friend."
Mu Yeol!
You're saying all of them sacrificed themselves?
Right.
"The documents that are related to the raid, they've all been destroyed."
The North Koreans sent a team.
All the press people are missing.
Their identity cards have been erased.
"For now, we are the only five people who know about this."
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."
Time is running out for him.
"I can feel it, John."
But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."
"""Sticks"" have the name of a club."
"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
But the respect I earned made me think I'd found the answer.
"When J.D. showed up a year later,"
I knew we'd get even stronger.
"Hey, man, what's your name?"
Hey!
Where you from?
La Primera.
East Los.
"You talk like a fucking chicon, man."
I'll check you out later.
"Órale, I see they finally let your white ass out of the hospital, carnal."
Santana!
"How you doing, man?"
"Cool, ese."

"You guys, check it out, man."
"This right here's J. D. , my best crime partner."
"This is Chuy, Casper, Chucko, Raymond and Big Happy."
J. D. :
Órale.
"Can I talk to you, ese?"
"Yeah, come here."
(SPEAKS spanish)
"You thinking of letting him in, ese?"
I told you he was my best crime partner.
"He ain't Mexican, ese."
(SPEAKS spanish)
Órale.
"So, homes, how's that leg?"
"Check it out, hard as a rock, ese."
"Shit, homes, throw some shellac on it!"
Shit!
"""Just tell her we're getting married""?"
"Oh, my God."
He's only 20 years old.
I've never even heard of this girl.
And how does that make you feel?
"Uh, ""my mom got married young... and still regrets it."""
That ought to do it.
"""Are you trying to tell me something?""..."
"What, is she stupid?"
"""Just that we should slow down."""
"""I h8 u, d'bag."""
What does that mean?
"Well, 8 could be ate."
"Like, ""I ate something."""
- Mm.
- And d'bag is like da bomb?
"I hate you, douche bag."
"Hey, Elka."
Thanks for letting me borrow this.
Oh.
What did you think of my mall walk mix?
Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.
Really?
I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.
"Oh, will."
Shut up!
Henschke!
We'll leave for a couple of days.
I'll let you know where we are.
Quiet!
You're coming along!
"Hey Mr Biberkopf, how are you?"
You've been away for a long time. 3 weeks.
Glogg stove?
"No, look."
- I'm not gonna buy that.
- It's a bandage anyway.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.
What's that about?
"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."
Car accident.
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
Illingworth.
"Ah, yes."
I see.
And then up there.
"Yep, yep."
And that leaves...
May.
"May, that sounds plausible."
And that gives...
Stewart.
Yes.
Alec Stewart.
You've got it.
You were on fire!
"Marianne, are you the big cricket fan?"
Yeah.
"Cos they were, ""Come on, Marianne - say some names!"""
"You were coming out with them, one after the other."
Very well done for a full ten points.
You certainly know your cricket.
Let's go through the names as you put them in.
"First of all you put in Cowdrey, Colin Cowdrey."
And you spotted you hadn't got that quite in the right order.
"Brearley, Mike Brearley, captain during Botham's famous Headingley Ashes."
"Hussain, Nasser Hussain."
"Pietersen, Kevin Pietersen."
"Illingworth, Ray Illingworth."
"May, Peter May."
"And finally Stewart, Alec Stewart."
And you didn't fall for any of our red herrings -
"Botham, Gower, Strauss, Willis."
Didn't go for any of those.
"See my hands, and my feet."
You can see it is I.
Myself.
Oh Lord...
Hvo-jm...
It's okay.
My baby.
You know Daddy's a policeman.
I'll take care of everything.
Daddy will.
"They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost."
"He said to them, ""Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?"""
Look at my hands and my feet.
It is I myself!
"Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."

It's still dawn.
What is it?
Somebody died.
Chun Woo-Hee
Who?
"You know Cho, the ginseng grower?"
Yeah.
His wife died.
It's pouring out there...
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
"Do you love me, Frank?"
Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
"You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?"
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
"-I don't like the C note, Rosato."
I take that as an insult.
Michael Corleone says hello!
Close the door!
Your friend the cop...
"Hey, Ritch."
It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?
"I just came in to clean up a little, you know?"
What's the matter?
-Is that something on the floor?
"-Carmine, not here!"
Anthony!
You open this bar and I'll blow your head in!
"Freddy, it's good to see you."
-How is he?
-He's okay.
He's in the back.
"Girls, take a hike."
In this room here.
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.
"I thought I could help you, Senator."
Hagen?
"-Listen, I did not..."
-It's all right.
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay.
You're very lucky.
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.
"Had this happened some place else, we couldn't have helped you."
I really wonder if she is meeting Saho-san a lot.
I became wrapped up in the world Saho-san taught me about.
Shizuru!
What are you reading?
Oh...
Familiar Loneliness.
You really are showing off!
"Now, now..."
What kind of book is it?
Sevigne de...
You have to read it the other way!
"Oh, yeah!"
Um...
The Letters od The Marquis de Sevigne!
"It really seems like an old book, Shizuru!"
Yeah.
"Shizuru, did you always read that type of book?"
"Oh yeah, Shizuru!"
"You went to the library with Saho-san, didn't you?"
Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"
!
You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"
It's so hard that I just can't keep up.
"You are too good, Shizuru."
Fumi!
You called her your teacher!
That was then!
I just want her to calm down a little!
"Oh, man..."
- What?
- No...
"No, not that."
Small...
Fly!
Fly!
Flying Tart!
"No, no, no, it got off to a flying start, and it's name... was Dragonfly!"
"Thank you, Polly."
"If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil."
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.
"- Ah, Major!"
"- 6:00, old boy."
"Oh, so it is."
"Uh, Major..."
"Can I offer you, uh..."
"Oh, very decent of you."
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
"Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?"
- What?
- For a memorial service?
"Oh, I didn't like the chap."
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
"- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?"
"Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy."
"No, no, could you look after some money for me?"
I won it on that horse.
"Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?"
I'm Kim.
I'm a psychologist and a feminist.
- I'll be paying the bill.
- I'm Wayne.
Wayne!
Glen.
How are you now?
"- Ah, good and you?"
"- Oh, not so bad."
"Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one."
I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.
- WAYNE:
Sure you do.
- I'm Kim.
Are you ever.
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.
"Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain."
- What can I get you to drink?
"- Uh, we'll need a minute."
"Uh, please and thank you."
Hmm.
All right.
"Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey?"
"- Sure, I will."
- All right.
He crosses his arms.
Are you aware of the psychology behind that?
"Now, when you say ""he,"""
"you're talking about me, right?"
Spy route.
Harrison Withers' place.
"Higher altitude, lower risk."
But always a show.
"Yeah, everybody's gonna have some grease today..."
"All right, now, Jelly Roll."
Yeah.
Lady Day
"Come what may, whatever you say"
We all gonna have a good time
"A little bit for you, Satchmo"
"You, Bessie"
"And how 'bout you, Jelly Roll?"
"Golly says, people who love work love life."
"Dizzy, Dizzy"
"I like Harrison Withers, 'cause he's a guy that loves both."
Scooby dah...
"Scooby-dooby, du-day"
"Okay, that's it."
"Curiously, Harrison lives for his cats."
Wow!
Birdland.
But his work is for the birds.
Charlie Parker.
Yardbird.
"In any case, his cages are the most beautiful"
I've ever seen.
It's him.
"The Health Department has it in for Harrison, 'cause they say he's got too many cats."
"I know, I know."
"Too bad for them, Harrison has a system."
"See a hat, don't be home."
Stay with me!
Warrick...
It's Grissom.
I was first on the scene.
Heard the shots.
I was in pursuit of the suspect.
What?
"No, Warrick, come on."
"Come on, Warrick!"
Where are the paramedics?
!
Please.
Please.
"Come on, Warrick."
You got to fight.
I need you to fight now.
"Fight for me, okay?"
Give me an ETA on the paramedics.
We need them here now.
No...
"No, come on."
No.

I was on my way to the diner.
I was going to tell Warrick in person that he could keep his job.
I parked my car over there just before 4:30.
I started to walk west towards the diner.
I was in this area here when I heard the shots.
I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.
She's not breathing.
Her neck feels broken.
What the fuck?
"Oh, my God, she's dead!"
-I fell asleep.
-What?
She must've crawled under there for warmth.
Are you fucking crazy?
You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.I must have sat on her.
-Jesus.
-My poor baby.
-I'm sorry.
"It was an accident, for Christ's sake."
How long have I said she shouldn't be on the furniture?
"It's because you were fucking high, Christopher."
You and your fucking smack!
Fuck!
Lifestyle.
-I'll get you another dog.
-I don't want another dog!
-Four in the side.
-One up the ass.
So nobody's heard from Ralph?
I'm starting to worry.
-I'll call him again.
-Try the gay man's choir.
I read they were having try-outs today.
"Three ball, far corner."
Son of a bitch.
Where you been?
"This was in the mail for you outside, Tony."
"Oh, no, you can't really do that, Billy."
- It'd be weird.
"- No, it won't be."
"- Here, give me your hands."
"- Billy, what are you..."
"Come on, just look at me."
"Come on, T, look at me."
Come on.
Look at me.
Look at me.
"You're not looking at me, T."
"Billy, please don't..."
"Come on, give me those blue circles, girl."
Come on.
That's what I'm talking about.
"I love you, T."
I...
Love... you.
Oh.
"No, it's not like that."
It's not.
It is like that.
"I love you, T."
"You're an amazing partner, but you're an even better friend."
Okay.
"- Oh, no."
- You even took a bullet for me.
"We don't really have to do this right now, okay?"
"I do, T. We all do, you know?"
"Two coffees, one with four pumps of caramel."
"Rosemary, give me your hands."
"Rosemary, you make delicious coffees."
Woman:
Are you done with that?
He did not!
Hey.
What do you want from me?
"Dad, it's me."
I stuck out my neck for you.
Now you live up-- [sigh] All right.
What took you so long?
They had to make the shit.
"Okay, so I got yours with no onions."
How you like it.
"Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it."
I will.
You should call a doctor.
"I told you, it's just a panic attack."
You sure your mom's okay with you staying here?
"Yeah, she seemed fine."
Did you ask her?
- No.
- That's what I thought.
"Well, she's been really busy lately."
She's on the phone more than usual.
"How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie?"
How are they doing?
Gross.
I don't know.
Okay?
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.
Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
I thought having you here was gonna teach you something.
-Then you go and do this.
-l didn't do anything.
You know what?
Your father's on his way here.
"So for now, go sit in the waiting room."
"-But, Dr. Pratt--"
-Waiting room.
Bag him.
-Got a second line?
-Vein keeps blowing.
Run first unit of O-neg.
Hold four more units ready to go.
So where's the reception gonna be?
He needs central access.
They haven't decided yet.
I'd go to Baby Joon's.
La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
"Neela, place a subclavian."
Cordis and sterile sixes.
What was the other place?
MALlK:
The Mandarin Club.
No way.
-That's a bad idea.
-Turn his head to the left.
-Systolic's 84. I like The Mandarin.
-Got a flash.
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
"Candles, white table cloths, you know."
"No, Baby Joon's."
"I'm telling you, martinis and chili fries."
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
Public loves to watch stars suffer like regular people.
Tito's Burritos para todos.
So any joy?
Ah.
These four windows.
I caught film of the victim on the night they were broken into.
What about Kai Ng or the blondie with her at The Edison?
Here.
The night Vicki DeMille was robbed.
There's Vicki and Chelsea and there's Kai.
I might have something.
February 10th footage.
Fast forward to 12:02:16.
Chelsea Sennett?
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
"Now March 5th, rewind to 04:42:03."
There's Chelsea again.
"All four times, Chelsea was with the burglary victim on the night they were robbed."
"One, that's random, two's coincidence."
Four?
That's a pattern.
"So what do you say, Manto?"
Eight.
Eight?
They're worth 120 retail.
Not anymore.
"Story's all over TMZ, AH, CNN."
You hit the big time.
We should take off for Palm Springs now.
It's just one more.
We need the money.
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Don't let him get in your head.
"Don't let him get in your head, Dave."
I know a place you will like.
Really?
Yes.
You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!
Dave!
Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
3rd: the Atom at 1.24.
2nd: the Westfield at 1.23.02.
And first - the amazing Radical at 1.19.08.
"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
"I can't say the same for the shooter, we'll get him good."
Who?
The dealer?
"No, apparently he's not the shooter."
We'll know more after the questioning.
We put him in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Eldorado?
"No, the Étoile d'Agadir."
Why?
Are you interested in the case?
"You're talking, I'm listening."
"Hello, Judicial Police."
Nadia speaking.
"Nadia, it's Gilou."
Can you check a licence plate?
"Go ahead, I'm listening."
"Alpha Charlie 073, India Kilo 75."
"Hold on, I'm checking."
Why are you asking?
It belongs to the Crime Squad.
"OK, thank you."
Hello?
"Hi, it's Dylan."
"I went to the home,"
I met my new youth workers.
Can I stop by to tell you about it?
"It's not easy at the moment, Dylan."
I'm with a client.
Can we talk later?
- Are you gonna be long?
"I don't know, I'll call you back."
Bastard.
The--the man who shot him...
"Lisa, what are you doing?"
DR PENZLER:
"And, um..."
hold on a minute.
EVERYONE:
Lisa?
Sit down.
Where do you think you're going?
Isn't this sweet?
Now we got the whole happy family.
Allie...it's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
DR PENZLER:
Ten adults and one child.
"That's right, exactly."
Sit down.
"Okay, here's the thing."
I don't want any cops.
I don't want any hostage negotiator or any of that Dog Day Afternoon crap...
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
RAY:
"One SWAT team or anything, I start shooting these people."
Good.
I want someone here in 15 minutes.
"There is a problem here right now, Allie, but it's gonna be all right."
Ray is just a little angry.
"""Ray is just a little angry""?"
"No, Ray is majorly pissed off."
"Oh, guys, check this shit out."
I woke up holding a winning ticket.
"Daddy's revenge, 20 grand!"
Oh!
- God damn it!
- Oh.
I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!
250 bucks!
"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."
100 bucks.
Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."
Daddy needs a cigar.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."
"No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on."
I think...
Why don't you just order Italian beef while you're at it?
"- Jesus, Frank."
"- That's a good idea, honey."
W...
"Jesus Christ, I can't get that goddamn song out of my head."
EZRA:
"Hey, Nathan."
Get back here.
You can't have Nathan.
He's one of my investors.
"Funny, he didn't mention that when he signed on."
"Now, can we discuss this another time?"
I have a rendezvous.
"Afternoon, Maude."
A woman like this renews a man's faith.
In what?
"Hi, Buck."
Lucy?
What are you doing in here?
You're gonna have to leave.
Not what you said last time we were in here.

I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
Yes!
I'm nuts.
Something's going on!
"-Stop with that, already."
Enough!
Stop with that!
-No!
"I'm telling you, I look in your face and I know that you're lying!"
-Get out!
Get out!
-Shut up!
Out of my life!
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.
Go ahead.
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all that you're good for!
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!
"Spider, what's your rush?"
"Thank you, Spider."
"Spider, that fuckin' bandage on your foot is bigger than your fuckin' head."
Next thing you know he's gonna be comin' in in one of these fucking walkers.
But you can still dance.
"Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider."
"You fucking bullshitter, you."
Tell the truth.

Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
Previously on Alcatraz...
Meet the '63s.
The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."
Police.
So we have to find these '63s?
We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know, they're not so bad."
"Lucy, get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr. Sengupta.
"Thank you, Warden James."
"I don't know, Hauser."
Maybe the pirate life ain't for you.
No.
You want some ice?
"No, no, no, no, no."
But she was something special to me.
"I mean, everybody felt that, but she was."
"I wouldn't be won'th a damn today, if it wasrt for her."
And it was more than that.
She was my friend.
Hey.
"Take it easy, Ward..."
"Exactly what time did it happen, Lieutenant?"
"Last night, sir."
About ten minutes to nine.
Ten minutes to nine.
God knows what I was doing when she could have used my help.
"Alone in my room, probably, with some idiot script."
"You were not, you were watching the ballgame with me."
I was?
A ballgame?
(SCOFFS)
"Oh, God."
I hope I wasrt.
I was alone.
I hope I wasrt...
But you werert alone.
"Listen, Lieutenant, he's upset."
"He's nervous, you know?"
And he...
"Mark, for God's sakes!"
Will you stop it!
This isn't one of my shows!
This actually happened.
Don't wig out.
Okay.
He's heading north now.
"I'm sorry, kid."
I'd Iike to apologize to everyone in advance for this.
"Check, please."
It's a rat!
"hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking."
Who's calling?
"I'm really sorry, but--"
Thank you.
I need to work late tonight.
There's chicken in the icebox.
You can have that and carrots--
"I'm way ahead of you, Mom."
I'll make it up to you.
-I love you.
-Me too.
"And, Hogarth  noscarymovies,nolate snacks, in bed by 8:00."
Got it?
"Come on, Mom."
"It's me, remember?"
"Why, the porpoise can communicate telepathically, Miss Melon."
If we can transplant 15 % of their brain matter into ours  we may be able to read minds.
Darn.
A perfectly good brain wasted.
You've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?
Let's say my place.
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.
Darn.
"You're gonna take yourself out, John."
You're gonna take yourself out.
Take a long vacation in Greece.
Pick up the law again.
Go the way of William O'Dwyer.
He fucked up and played ambassador to Mexico.
I'm not that ambitious.
"Then suck it up, and find some other way."
Listen to you.
I thought I'd see a boy's tears.
The tears are there.
Just can't see them right now.
"You got the stuff, Pappy."
I love to see it in a guy.
Kevin Calhoun for City Council.
Voters of the 6th District...
Kevin Calhoun.
How are you?
Kevin Calhoun.
How about some literature?
Kevin Calhoun.
"How are you, sir?"
Good afternoon.
I'm running for 6th District.
We got some important issues.
We need to clean this place up.
I'd love your vote.
I'm running for City Council.
Hello.
Kevin Calhoun.
-Running for City Council.
-l'll vote for you.
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
"- Plus, he won the Civil War."
- What about Leo?
- What'd I do?
- As running mate.
Bartlet-McGarry.
- Done.
"- It's not absurd, you know."
- It is.
- It's not totally absurd.
"- Yes, it is."
- He wants your parking space.
- I really do.
- It's not totally absurd.
You have a good parking space.
"You know, if it weren't for the drinking and the Valium... ."
"- Yet, Grant... ."
- That's right.
"They told Lincoln, ""Grant's a drunk."" He said:"
"""Send my generals a case of what he drinks."""
- I see a 30-second spot.
- An alcoholic can't be vice president?
You really think the 20th century didn't see an alcoholic in the West Wing?
I'll be around.
"Hey, Leo."
- They didn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, I didn't take anything."
What's going on in Idaho?
The tunnel's still hot.
We're looking at evacuating Elk Horn.

You despicable cad!
Come here!

"Who's looking for him, please?"
- He's Master Ding.
- Marshal of seven provinces.
- The Brave One.
- It's nice to meet you.
I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-hung.
This doesn't concern you.
Step aside.
"Marshal, have you met Wong Fei-hung?"
Of course!
We've even fought!
You fought him?
Does Wong Fei-hung look like me?
"No, Wong Fei-hung is a young man."
"At most, 22 years old."
"If he were that young, he'd invite you for tea to celebrate."
Why did you call him a despicable cad?
Are you messing with me?
"Marshal, I'll be honest with you."
I'm Wong Fei-hung.
You're Wong Fei-hung's father?
"Wong Fei-hung, stay there."
"the West Sitting Hall, and the president's bedroom."
"Killick, he's trying to burn the place."
Second floor.
Send your men.

Stop hurting my White House!

Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?

She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
Richie Rich.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Here we go.
Break a leg.
- OK.
"Get off, you maniac."
"Hello, hello."
Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."
- Get off!
- The greatest thing
That I possess...
"The smile of a child, a beautiful woman, just simply being..."
British.
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."
I do.
"I do,"
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!

Don't try it!
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!
Don't be suckers.
Stay out of it!
"If I didn't know you were stir-nuts, I'd blast ya!"
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
No one is there.
Hey why are you peeking and scaring my girlfriend?
I'm not scaring her.
Look at my back.
Hey why me?
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.
Neither am I.
I've been shot!
Look at my back.
Stop the car.
I'll count to 3.
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.
This diamond is gone.
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.
Papa will be shocked once he sees it.
This is the 20 crores diamond.
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?
Why Papa?
Because Demelo only knows about having.
Pa Pa...
Papa.
And you came back and left the diamond.
You know that electricity only comes for 2 hours a day.
And you let it go to waste.
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?
Like every time electricity went this time too.
Now it'll be back Tommorow.

Why don't you check these things?

We keep it in the lounge.
In the lounge?

You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
"No, no, that came in third."
Uh...
Fishwife!
Stay home.
It's an end-around.
GEORGE:
"No, no, it's not."
He's still got it.
He's still got it.
STEVEN:
Shit.
- Who let that happen?
It's embarrassing.
GEORGE:
Argh!
DEVON:
That is so embarrassing.
What?
Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?
"Oh, yeah, no."
"We're good, we got takeout."
"No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f..."
GEORGE:
"All right, here we go."
"- Come on, defense, wake up."
You have to be kidding me.
I just got a little bit more of this I gotta finish.
There's some laundry I'm gonna put away then I had another load of clothes in the dryer.
"I did get some of the food your dad likes, but some healthy stuff too."
"Just, you know."
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[HAMMERING]
Bend your knee a little bit more.
"Yeah, for what it's worth, engaged people can look around, too."
Lot of options out there.
Where's Stuart?
(giggles)
Out.
Who are you?
I'm Dale.
He left me in charge.
Really?
Yeah.
"I don't get it, either."
"I want to return this ""Wild West and Witches"""
Ka'a expansion pack.
Sorry.
I don't do returns.
They're hard.
"Sure, sure."
"Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
I don't know.
He went out for coffee.
With a girl.
(high-pitched giggling)
"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
You okay?
Am I okay?
"Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule."
Am I okay?
"I'm okay, too!"
Wild Bill Witchcock.
A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
Flaming Spittoon.
"And for the record,"
What is it?
The Ark.
If it is there at Tanis...
Then it is something men was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey?
"I'm surprised at you Jones, Talking that way about our baby."
He's got your looks too.
And your brain...
"I noticed it, she's a smart little thing, smart!"
Hey!
where are you going?
"She'll be all right, have a date."
"Come on, come on..."
Marion!
What's this?
It's a Date.
You eat 'em.
Sieg Heil!
Ja.
Sieg Heil.
Ist Nae.
"Ja, ja."
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
"Ha, ha!"
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"""'Take this, all of you, and eat it."
"""'For this is my body.'"
"""When the supper was ended, he took the cup."
"""Again he gave you thanks and praise."
"""He gave the cup to his disciples and said:"
'Take this...

"""'This is the cup of my blood."
"""'The blood of the new and everlasting Covenant, the mystery of faith.""'"
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Did you do that?
Do it again.
In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
Ego te absolvo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bonjour!
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
"- I didn""t say nothing, Bobbi."
"- But you""re thinking it."
"The way your first marriage ended, I don""t know how you can be like that."
- Like what?
- So damn trusting.
Because I know you.
"I know what""s in here."
Hello?
"L""m looking for Maser."
"Tim Maser with an ""M."" Parking tickets."
You got to wait.
"Breaking and entering, theft, murder, anything."
- So make her parking tickets go away.
- Jenny!
"This man thinks he""s going to marry my daughter."
- Cassie?
- Yes.
"All right, everyone, you heard the woman."
"Chop, chop."
- We got to dig up some dirt on this guy.
"- Maser, Tim."
"L""ll help you."
I think my husband is cheating on me.
"Honey, he""s not the first man to double dip."
"You sure we haven""t met?"
"Lt""s just a feeling."
Probably all in my mind.
"- I swear I""m going crazy."
- You look so familiar to me.
"She""s lost weight."
My stomach hurts all of the time.
Nerves.
I feel proud of you.
"I might be your father, but you were born for the people!"
Previously on Kyle XY...
Kyle?
"Be careful, even in our backyard."
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
Show me how.
I will.
She's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
You have to earn forgiveness.
"""She Could Be You. "" What?"
The two of you used to play that song all the time.
D4.
It's not there.
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.
It was a way of identifying one another.
And you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
Two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
How were you before?
Invisible.
I'll call...
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
LUCY:
Uh-huh.
-Congratulations.
-Same as you.
As me?
Ha.
"You're the father, Buck."
"Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby."
LUCY:
And a wedding too.
-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not about to get married.
"No, no."
[LUCY sobbing ]
"Well, Buck, it looks like it's time to get yourself a ring and a new suit."
[laughing ]
Well?
"I've wired lawyers, courthouses."
Anyone who would respond.
"From what I can tell, there's nothing to prevent them from taking Vin."
What about Judge Travis?
He's days away from a telegraph office.
Marshal's right.
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.

And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
"Ith that's it, thank you."
-You're welcome.
And a coke.
-Yeah sure.
Here you go.
Your mom would be real proud of you.
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?
Close your mouth when you eat.
Very nice.
-Hyder.
So?
How is school boys?
-I hate school.
It's fine.
This whole thing's a joke.
Dad of the fuckin year over here.
Not here.
-Why not uh?
Everyone knows CPS took your kid.
Whole town knows.
Shut your mouth now.
-They don't know about Galveston.
That's enough.
-He fucking left us.
Stop.
-Don't tell me what to do.
It wasn't my responsibility to take care of everything.
Take care of Wes while you boozed up down there.
"Alright, come on."
"3 weeks dad, 3 whole weeks you were gone."
"Admit it, you wanna drink yourself to death."
"Cause when Duncan found you, you were gonna leave us for good, weren't you?"
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
"Well, I had the baby."
Really?
Yeah.
"You guys took so long,"
I'm already pregnant with another one.
Here's your ice water.
Thank you.
"Anything else I can get for you, dirty stranger?"
Dr. Roland!
"Oh, my God."
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah.
I didn't need to see the Rolling Stones tonight.
Where's Zack?
Jail.
Boom!
Just won the office pool.
Okay.
"Let's take a gander at the old money maker, huh?"
"Oh, six centimeters."
Shouldn't be long now.
But Zack's not here.
"Olivia, help."
Don't worry about it.
I know people at every precinct in this town:
"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.
Blast off.

Best I've ever seen.
"If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing on this load for two years."
- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?
- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuff'll take a 7-to-1 hit on the street.
"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
"Take what's left there with you, and good night."
Uh-uh.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
"If anyone should be there,"
I should.
I feel awful.
You have to tell me where you got those boots.
Olivia?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to use my journalistic connections to get them out.
"Now, which one arrested Zack?"
Grumpypuss behind that desk.
And don't touch his hat.
He's very attached to it.
Marion?
Olivia?
Oh...
"Oh, my God."
Darling.
You're alive!
All right.
"Olivia and Abby can catch up, but we've got to get you to the hospital to meet your son, mister."
When did you get a Porsche?
"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.
I didn't know your brother was...
An expatriate.
I know.
It's surprising.
Okay.
"Billie, I'm out and on the way."
How you doing?
They won't let me eat.
Tell them to let me eat!
"Dude, it's all going down, man."
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door, do you hear me?"
I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs.
I'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out!
"You'll go far, Henry, unlike this piece of shit."
"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
- Higher self!
- Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.
"Oh, shit."
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
"I'm sorry you're upset, okay?"
- Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
"That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this."
"Hey, I..."
"I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way!
This place is not haunted by a ghost!
"And when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new king of... it's right behind me, isn't it?"
Aah!
- Donkey!
"- Oh, my goodness!"
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah...
"Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
"Grab the kids, and let's get going."
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!
Run!
Run for your life!
- Keep away!
Keep away!
- Take it!
Something more interesting in the scene?
All were killed with a 9mm pistol.
The gun was not found.
But back to what we were talking about.
Christer calling you.
He said that a person would be killed.
But he does not talk you who is?
The Christer knew who it was?
I do not know.
I could not ask before it shut down.
You were covering Christer.
Why did not he tell them?
-No Was Lars who answered.
He called you often?
What does this have to do?
-Christer Was his brother. -how Do you know?
I am the police.
We will continue?
I wonder how long you have to spend.
Strømme.
Yes?
Ok.
I come already.
Exploded a bomb in Exodus.
It is a restaurant in the center.
-Still Not just here!
-Acabou To happen!
-Exodus Is controlled by the league Z.
-Hammit Milonkovic?
I'll go with you.
-how Come?
We're looking for his daughter.
"Granville, far be it for me to try to influence a h--hunchback."
Come on.
"There she goes, the grocer's delight!"
-
"- Granville, have you got that mike fixed up?"
-
- Just a minute.
The nurse is there.
I want to catch her before she goes in.
I've got an idea.
-
- Come on.
-
- Here you are.
"Thank you, Igor, my faithful servant."
This is what I'm going to say.
"""Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, folks!"
"""This is Ark--Ark--Ark..."
This is Ark...
"This is Ark--Ark..."""
"I don't think I'd b--better do this, Granville."
Did you notice a little s--stammer?
"Nothing worth talking about, no."
"But you'd better let me do it, just in case."
You look more like a duck's jockey.
Disc jockey!
Disc jockey!
"In my case, a slipped disc jockey!"
Don't worry.
"Listen, don't start it off till I give you the signal."
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
I don't think so.
[snaps] Go wait by the door.
So we have a deal?
"You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones."
- Whatever those are.
"- [man] One, two, three, four!"
[rock music plays]
- He bought it.
"- Yes, he did."
"More importantly, he had no idea it was you."
"Yeah, but was all that really necessary?"
I am not whipped.
"It's all part of the play, Richard."
- Not my play.
- No.
Uncle Eddie's play.
[upbeat music] [applause]
Welcome back.
"Today we are doing a very special show,"
"""Foxy at 50... and Beyond."""
"- Welcome, guys."
- [applause]
"So, Dr. Jane, you have a hot new book out there titled,"
"""When I Grow Up I Want to be a JILF."""
"It's GILF, Donny."
As in grandmother I'd like to f...
- Uh...
- A GILF.
- Right.
- [laughter]
"Today, 50 is an entirely new landscape."
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""
- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?
No.
"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:
She wanted to do it.
LAURA:
Really?
She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
- Is that not right?
PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."
"- Ari, look at us becoming BFF's."
- I know.
- I love that it's capsulated on film.
- It's on film for...
- That's an attractive looking face.
- You're drunk.
- Good look.
- You're beautiful.
"Ari, when you..."
- Okay.
- I love this.
Have you been looking at me?
"""I've been looking at you guys."
"Have you been looking at me?"""
A lot of good practice.
Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!
call me Dean.
"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."
-Right after I finish talking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
"squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth."
I'm trying not to wig out here.
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.
Beans didn't do anything.
He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag.
No!
No!
Don't you touch Beanbag!
No!
All right!
Bonus round.
Winner takes all.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.
"- Okay, that's not necessary."
- Cindy.
"- Well, listen, take care, guys."
See you later.
- [ Ray ] Hey.!
"- What happened to you, Freddy?"
- [ Chuckles ] Fender benders.
She's kinda cute.
[ Phone Ringing ]
- [ Ringing ]
- Dispatch.
Hi!
Can I call you back?
bye.
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I got it.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Dispatch.
"No, no."
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
"Jack, it's me, Jane."
Just checking in on the latest on the Bentleys.
"Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank."
- There's something going out between those brothers.
We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Golf Hotel to all units.
I need a report.
Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
I want two of you on doors!
Get outta here!
"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."
Where?
"Too late now, you'll have to look up through the roof but you won't see it."
- Your sisters.
JANINE:
"I mean, everyone makes mistakes."
"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not?"
"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:
I am married.
And what's your question?
MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:
It's moving fast.
Just on our way.
"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
Come to my cabin immediately
Okay sir..
Sir..
- Is your son a Police officer?
I am asking you.
Why do you laugh?
Is your son a Police officer?
He is not even passed Inter.
How can he become a Police officer sir?
"No, he is lying."
"He is a Police Officer, I have seen."
I now understood whom you have seen.
"I, myself was confused being his own father."
No surprise in you being confused.
What are you saying?
There is a Police Officer who looks same as my son.
He even has a girlfriend.
He speaks non-stop in Hindi.
My son doesn't know any Hindi.
Are you sure?
How can person failing Inter and working as stuntman become a Police Officer sir?
You can go now..
- OK sir.
Sudhakar..
- Sir.
I am sending the details.
You do an inquiry.
You're so fat!
- Hello.. you.
Do you know him?
Our Bruce Lee..
What is he doing?
Colton!
Colton Graham can help us out.
- No!
Fuck that!
- Yes!
No doubt.
"If anyone could clear your names, it's him."
"No, I'm sorry."
That dickweed is not helping us.
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?
Not anymore.
"But the wedding is at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas."
"But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whole... wedding thing, right?"
"You know, that actually might be our only hope."
Fuck!
How do we get there?
We can't go to the airport.
They're looking for us.
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?
But first...y'all got to get in the spirit of the party.
"- What do you mean, spirit of--"
- What do you think I mean?
- What about you?
- Me?
I've been in the spirit.
"- Oh, God!"
"- Oh, my God, dude!"
"Oh, my God!"
"- Love your dickdo, Raza."
- Yeah.
You think?
I think you're really brave.
To consider rebuilding who you are.
I don't know if I could do that.
You could.
"- Well, I gotta go."
- Oh yeah.
"Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?"
"Yeah, I'm just not sure if I do."
I'll see ya.
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.
- Hey.
- I got you something.
But I don't have anything for you.
And yet you do.
A couple of songs on there that made me think of you.
Of course most things do.
I didn't know you were into Travis.
"Are you kidding, I love Travis."
He's the best.
Who?
Travis guy.
Are we not in the same conversation?
Check out tracks 8 and 13.
You'll love them.
Bye.
Thought you might want that back.
I already have it.
So do I.
Tracks 8 and 11?
Totally you.
So what are you doing?
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
I hope you don't mind that we opened things up.
Long as you pay for them.
"Not planning on drinking that beer and driving, are you?"
LILA:
No.
No.
We wouldn't do that.
This is for later.
Just kidding.
"CASHIER: $7.95, please."
Y'all have a nice night.
Y'all too.
"She's too young for you, Bill."
I like them young.
Shit!
"That trooper's behind us, man."
Don't look back.
Just be cool.
What do we do if he pulls us over?
He ain't going to pull us over.
"Slow down, Ray."
Don't panic.
"He recognized me back there, man."
I know he did.
"If he did, he would have arrested you."
He was just looking us over.
"White boy and a nigger girl in Texas, that's all it is."
Right now he's probably running our plates.
FEMALE RADIO DISPATCHER:
5-42.
"5-42, go ahead."
"On your out-of-state plate,"
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.

I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
Metoo.
I hate when people are late.
Metoo.

Metoo.
I was the first to arrive at both parties I've attended.
I was the first to arrive at both parties I've attended.

- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
Keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey.
You can't make people love you
But you can make them fear you.
For what it's worth
You're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
It's already been over an hour.
The bar's closing soon.
She's gonna come.
I know she is.
Whoa Whoa whoa.
Wait.
Wait.
Dan is gossip girl?
Gossip girl?
You crazy?
Then what are you doing here?
I loopt you.
Are you waiting for gossip girl?
And I know you don't approve.
I'm gonna go close the tab.
This grudge match thing--
It d--it doesn't seem like you.
What's--what's going on?
I don't want to be irrelevant.
Irrelevant?
you're serena van der woodsen.
"It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
Your brother and me -- we needed you.
"You walked away, Sam."
- You walked away!
"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
Leave me alone.
I just mean...
"I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
You're sorry?
"And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil?"
"No, you don't, dear."
No.
"The great warning-off of May 8th, yes."
"Good old Saint George, eh, Major?"
"Well, he killed a hideous fire-breathing old dragon, didn't he?"
"Ran it through with a lance, I believe."
Mr. Fawlty!
Mr. Fawlty!
Is Missus...
room no like.
She want speak to you.
Is problem.
"Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?"
"Why... why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?"
"I don't know, Major."
Better than marrying it.
Marrying it?
"But he didn't have to kill it, though, did he?"
"I mean, he could've, uh, just not turned up at the church."
"Good morning, Madam."
Can I help you?
- Are you the manager?
"- I am the owner, Madam."
- What?
- I am the owner.
I want to speak to the manager.
"- I am the manager, too."
- What?
I am the manager as well.
Manaher.
He manaher.
"I, uh..."
"And I did one recently that was so big, when I..."
What was the question again?
The question was about...
LAUGHTER
I mean...
"I tell you who misheard, David O'Doherty."
LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"
"""you've done there,"" you know?"
LAUGHTER
"OK, top thing people get jealous about."
People that can spell definitely.
LAUGHTER
Ohh...
"I've got D-E-F - after that, I've got nothing left in the locker."
LAUGHTER
That's why defo was invented.
Defo.
LAUGHTER
New girlfriends or new boyfriends.
"Yeah, that's a good answer, yeah."
It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...
Yeah.
Flirting is exactly it.
Ahh.
APPLAUSE
"Yes, the top thing people get jealous about is their partner flirting."
I'm a bit of a flirt.
"Just last night, I had a girl give me a look that left me in no doubt as to what she wanted."
"No, it's pretty good, hon."
"- Well, I -"
- No plate.
- No?
- No.
No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."
"- (McKenna) 0h, I see."
- May I show you?
"- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?"
- l'll hold it for you.
- See.
- There we are.
"Well, I, uh... uh..."
"Boy, could I use this hand."
"- l can't, uh..."
- lt's alright.
- lt's good stuff.
- No one minds.
"- lt's messy, but worth it."
- l'll practise on an olive.
"0h, honey, it's wonderful."
Here.
Take a bite.
- Good?
- Yeah.
"Tell me - does this way of eating have to do with religion, or something?"
I think it's more social than religious.
I don't know.
"It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before..."
"Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay."
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty."
"Goodbye, Mr. Firkin."
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly."
Right?
"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.
"- Oh, you don't?"
- No.
"Well, how would you say it?"
I don't know.
I'd call her up and ask her to a dance.
Or a movie?
"Yeah, or a movie and we'd go and get something to eat."
Or drink?
"No, not any girl I'd propose to."
"Oh, I see."
"Well, go on."
"Well, then when the time came, I guess I'd hold her hand."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Then what would you say?
I'd say:
"""Betty, I'm crazy about you."
"Will you marry me?"""
"Well, let me think."
"Yes, Ed, I guess I will."
"- Well, then we're engaged."
- I think that's what they call it.
Oh.
"- It's swell, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
"Hey, what will your mother say?"
"She'll probably say, ""Thank, heavens. """
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
How you like the sodas?
"- Okay, Nick, take it out of there."
Is she my daughter?
Of course not.
She is mine and Jørgen's.
What were you thinking?
- Is she my daughter?
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I asked you a question!
- I'll call you tomorrow!
Won't you come to bed?
"- Why did you do it, Jørgen?"
- Do what?
"I didn't know it was him, Helene."
It's just too much of a coincidence.
- He shouldn't have come.
- No.
But we can't control everything in the world.
"Hi, it's 602 again."
Do I have any messages now?
Fine.
Thanks.
- That's nice.
- Let me have a look?
- It's got small swastikas on it.
- They're not swastikas.
It's wonderful.
It's from...
- It's from Allan and Kristina.
- One of our really good lawyers.
"He'll be fired for giving such an ugly vase, right?"
- Put it over there.
- It goes in the basement.
I have to talk to Helene.
Where is it...?
Where is it...?
Show me!
- ...
"Jesus Christ, dude...!"
- ...
What...?
You explain that to his mom...
That's okay...
"She's not going to tell her mom on us, is she...?"
"She fell down on the playground, that's all..."
Right?
Right...?
"Say it, little girl..."
"Say it... come on, dude..."
Let's go...
I fell down...
...On the playground.
"Well you have to be more careful, Okay honey?"
I don't like to see my baby hurt...

We can't talk here.

Why not?
Count to 15 before you follow me.
"Second thought, make that 20."
Brent!
I said 20.
What has gotten into you?
You've become a cub scout?
No.
These two fingers represent the pause button.
On our friendship.
What?
River Rock Publishing is in the middle of a cold war.
"I'm America, and you're the USSR."
That's ridiculous.
Crossing enemy lines is a mistake.
It complicates things.
"Oh, Brent, come on."
This is crazy.
How long can you two keep this up?

Blame Julianne.

"I'm sorry, you'll have to discuss it with my solicitor."
Don't you start.
Now...
Sharon has a bit of news for yous.
I can't help it.
"I'm sorry, Sharon."
"Go on, love."
I'm going to have a baby.
"- That's massive, Sharon."
- Is that all?
"Women, what?"
Right.
Where's your bump?
All right?
"That's the latest diet book there, Bob."
Number five on the best-seller list.
"- ""Hey, Fat""?"
- Yeah.
"See, the author explains that title there in the introduction."
"That's what they used to call him when he was a kid. ""Hey, Fat!"""
"He got so mad that he set about as his life's work to make himself skinny, and it worked."
That's a picture of him on the back cover.
- Where?
- Right there.
"If he writes another book, he should title it Hey Corpse."
"Okay, gang."
"Why don't we gather around, and... drink a toast to the birthday boy here."
- Okay?
"Here, Emily."
"This is yours, dear."
"- Oh, Thank you."
Bob.
Okay.
"- Okay, ready?"
- Ready.
Here's to Bob Hartley.
We wanna see more of him...

I get it.
"- Cheers, cheers."
"- Cheers, cheers."
Cheers.
Look at that.
Aren't you going to drink your water?
Back to work.
"Hey, Kelli Ann."
Did I get any calls?
"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no."
Not a lot of phone traffic.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
What's her name?
Who?
"The girl, Alex."
There's no girl.
"You can't hide it, man."
I know strung out and you are strung out.
"Okay, please."
KELLI ANN:
This is amazing.
"You can't focus, right?"
"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day wishing you could write songs."
"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
Shit.
"Welcome to my world, asshole."
Let me get the door.
Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
I gotta finish this stuff.
Okay.

So I'll see you at home.

There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.

Please...?
Give me the fucking keys!
Thanks!
"- See you at home, little girl..."
- Hey!
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!
Shut up!
"Abby, I did it!"
You did what...?
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital I almost got suspended.
But I did it.
What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen Yeah?
- Hey...
You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
"""ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH"""

- Yes.
This this kid who used to live in the building.
Tommy.
"He would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends, and.."
"And when they weren't here, He would play ping-pong with me."
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
Looking for a room.
"My mother ain't here, but the lady in number two will show you the rooms."
Yes?
Yes?
I'm looking for a room.
Mrs. Maggione's kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes.
I'll get the key.
Third floor.
There's something about your face that looks awfully familiar.
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
"- No, really."
"Listen, sister, all I'm looking for is a room."
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it a good cleaning.
- It's all right.
I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.
- I'll take the room.
What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.
- Sold.
- In advance.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
How did you happen to come to this house?
"Looking for references, huh?"
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
"Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish."
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?
Turn him away from me.
Keep up with me.
You can move faster than that.
"Yo, Tino!"
"- Hey, how you doing?"
- What's going on?
I got something for you.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

But he needs help and you're his friend.

"It's okay with you, I'd prefer you fuck me the old fashioned way, 10 percent at a time, huh?"
You come to my house with your junkie girlfriend.
I have two kids here.
What are you talking about?
"That, I..."
[chuckles]
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.

"You just want to play with me, right?"
You take me for fun!
"I said, you played me for fun, didn't you?"
"You don't keep your word, you bastard smelly man!"
Why are you late?
I've been waiting for you.
You actually dare to cheat in front of me.

Is your head messed up?
So I have to spell it out now?
I don't like you.

"No, she did not come here."
"John, who is this?"

I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.

The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
"- Yes, it was."
"Well, at least Jo seems well."
- I kissed him on the ear.
- Perhaps if you had another?
Why ever not?
Surely David's capable?
Yes.
But he can't bear to pass me in the hallway for fear of touching me.
"- Come on, Lucy."
- I do love you.
It's not necessary to tell Father about this.
- No.
- No.
"Come on, then."
"- Bye-bye, Grandma."
"- Come along, Jo."

- Astrologer?
My God.
He believes... attack will be at Normandy.
All right.
"None of my business, but I know you and Bradfield were..."
He really liked you.
Anyone could see that.
Like I said... none of my business.
"When I mentioned Clifford Bentley, that last fella spat on the floor."
Right.
This is it.
Reggie Barker.
How would David move the body on his own?
I've seen a wife butcher a husband twice her size.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of when shit hits the fan.
Not long before evening drinking.
Someone should be in.
Open up!
Police.
I can see you!
Idiot.
Sarge?
Stay there.
Make sure no one comes out.
"Reggie Barker, is it?"
"- Where are you going, mate?"
- I don't want no trouble.
- The Bentley boy's upstairs.
- David's here?
Yeah.
Stinking the place out with that bloody stuff.
"Is his old man here, as well?"
- He's CID.
- So?
So I don't want no part of this.
- Help me move him.
What have you done?
"""The lovers moustache tickles"", doesn't it?"
I've shaved it!
I can see what you want.
"You misunderstand, sir!"
This is... a cross-connection!
What?
Let me put it plainly.
What you are dreaming of can never be true!
But what are you scared of?
Wouldn't you be scared if a man proposed to you?
It's wrong.
Cancel it!
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?
Hart's my husband.
"But he's Godbole, isn't he?"
True but I'm married!
Obviously.
But you never spoke of it.
I thought...
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?

"Okay, you have one second... go."
"So I'm saying, I think you look mad sexy."
You here with somebody?
Yeah.
"All right, that's cool, ma."
I'm kidding.
I'm here with my friends.
"Got you, got you."
If I told them everything they'd never let me go out.
Baby... come on.
"Simon, we've got to talk."
"Simon, look at me!"
- You are always watching porn.
"- Just go, OK?"
It was only porn.
It didn't mean anything.
I did it for us.
You are dead to me.
- You look like a worn-out corn hole.
- Simon just dumped me.
- You were hooked on each other.
- It was the porn mag.
He's always jerking off to porn.
Men can be real creeps.
"Take this, baby."

A week ago monday.
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
- Excuse me?

Like always... watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
- Do own a pair of scissors Mr. O'dwyer?
- Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please."
- How about some metallic paint?
- Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."

"Think it over, I make a terrific potato salad."
Ponch.
"We did good today, babe."
"Yeah, let's celebrate."
Let's get back to the campground.

Deal.
"Wait, y'all actually about to play this shit?"
No peeking.

"Yeah, did you find it?"

Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
Jimmy you don't understand anything.
What I don't understand anything is why anybody would want to take your picture.
That's what I don't understand.
You're just a freak.

That's why you look just like her.
Such a sweet point.
"Don't step on that shoe, we'll have to pay for it."

One day the chicken woman had chicks.
"And everybody stepped on, cause they were so ugly..."

My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
"Hey, I wanna meet him."""
"And Kat's like, ""All right, I'll go introduce you."
"Come on."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- I never met him either.
Andy was talking to somebody and then Kat goes:
"- ""Andy, this is Ari."""
"- Oh, man, that is so funny."
- Great.
- I couldn't help it.
"This is at The Box, which is an amazing space."
This was amazing.
This was...
Yes.
Yes.
- This was a really fun day.
- They did that how many times?
Like 10?
"Upwards of 10 probably, right?"
- Yeah.
- This is one of my favorite days.
"We're all, like, hanging out in there."
- My parents were here this day.
"- Yeah, your parents were there."
I love everybody's different faces.
Look at this.
Bewildered.
"This was originally slow motion, right?"
Or I guess we shot it regular.
"It was, but we realized the song wasn't long enough for us to play it in slow motion."
- Right.
"Oh, man."
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.

We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
Thanks.
You and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
Sunsets are really pretty.
Maybe we will.
Dead man walking.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I come in?
There's a front door.
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.
What happened?
"Oh, I"
- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
Jumping off another roof?
"Kyle, I've learned my lesson."
And I'm here to learn another one.
"You said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me."
I can't.
There's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
"Oh, Amanda."
She's home?
As a surprise.
You're anxious about it.
"Your heart's beating really fast, I can tell."
"She told me, ""We need to talk. """
So?
You don't think that means anything?
Uh... it means she wants to talk to you?
Isn't that a good thing?
That's what I thought.
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
"You're here about Ben, of course."
What about Ben?
-Ben Haverman.
"This morning, the newspaper said he had died."
"Out of the blue, it said."
That must have been our Ben.
"Bronze Lion, ex assault group member, it has to be him."
"Yes, it's Ben."
Oh God.
Out of the blue.
Was it his heart?
Are you going to the cremation?
"-No, I have to do something else."
You?
"-Well, so many people are dying."
Fantastic garden.
"-Yes, it's my pride and joy."
It takes a lot of time.
They're beautiful I've never seen them before.
Which ones exactly?
-The pink ones.
I've got those from Israel.
The children brought them for me.
Nice holiday present.
-They live there.
Have a seat.
"Yes, they're three very tough rascals."
They participate in every war.
"Syria, Jordan, Egypt, you name it."
They've got that from you.
They're real American Jews.
Very fanatical.
"""And I meant what I said, and I said what I meant."
"""An elephant faithful, 100%."""
Give me five!
"Yes, sirree."
"Hi, baby."
- Your mom smells good enough to eat.
"- What does she smell like, Daddy?"
She smells like pepperoni pizza.
Sausage.
Lots of cheesy cheese.
And a frog.
"Clara, honey... did you tell Mr. Rodriguez that we would eat the cost of his kid""s procedure?"
- Dad?
- Boo Boo!
"Hey, baby, welcome home."
My girl.
"This afternoon, I hired a new receptionist."
"J.T., take the elbows off the table, honey."
"It""s rude."
Thank you.
"- What""s her name, Daddy?"
- Rebecca Singer.
But she goes by Lisa.
She just went through a rough divorce.
"She""s completely broke."
Can you imagine?
Take your fingers out of your mouth and eat more.
"L""ll bet she""s super nice."
She just needs somebody to give her a break.
"- That""s way generous of you, Dad."
- Just try one string bean.
"You know, it felt good."
A camel!
Uh-huh.
Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.
"Well, it's Northern Africa."
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're just a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert.
I don't know. ln school they call this the Dark Continent.

Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
What's the matter?
(Both Speaking Arabic Language)
"Well, I sure want to thank you."
"Without your help, anything might have happened here."
"My pleasure, monsieur."
There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
Yeah.
Just what was the trouble?
Uh... your little boy accidentally pulled off his wife's veil.
- 0h.
Yeah.
- Hank!
"I want to introduce my wife, Mrs McKenna."
- How do you do?
You've gotta be the youngest attorney in the firm to sit on a case this big.
I don't know.
"Listen, here, hey."
"I was gonna give this to you at dinner, but it feels appropriate here."
Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."
- Can we afford this?
I had some stocks pay out dividends.
You know.
Can't a guy do something nice for this girl?
"Yes, he can."
I love you.
"Wait, you didn't get this off that dead girl, did you?"
Wow.
Wow.
- Just checking.
I'm just... pushed too far to his throat.
Did you know...
- I don't know.
Tell me how.
Say it.
"Yeah, I would've."
- How?
"I don't know, okay?"
"No, it was an accident."
I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
- Bring him in.
- Yes sir!
"I'm so famous, there's bound to be impostors."

Say something or he'll get mad.

What's the name of Hiroshima Tora's father?
"He doesn't even know his pa's name,"

"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
The boxes aren't going anywhere.
But I told Nicole that I-
The best part about spring cleaning is ditching out on spring cleaning.
"You can't do it, can ya?"
You always have to do the right thing.
And you always find a way of putting fun before work.
"Alphabetical order, my encyclopedic friend."
"But I will have you know, I'm done with my room."
And I'm trashing this with the rest of my stuff.
But first...
Bite marks.
Foam.
It's irresistible.
Come on.
Show me what you got.
Okay.
Keep going.
More.
Whoa!

You didn't tell me you were coming.
No one knows.
I'm surprising my mom for her birthday.
You're a good present.
How's New York?
Amazing.
Everything I imagined.
And the music program?
The teachers are all so inspiring.
And the students there are so talented.
Like you.
Yeah.
Chelsea.
Colin.
Colin?
Let's go!
Morning.
Tell Casey I'm sorry.
It sounded like I woke the baby.
He's cutting his first tooth.
Nobody sleeps.
That's a lot of blood.
It's Miranda Clark's.
She's in the hospital.
"Multiple cuts and bruises, concussion, possible skull fracture."
She have profile?
Her boyfriend does.
"Colin Blakely, The New Shadow."
"A year ago, he's bussing tables, now he gets 3 mil a picture."
So it fits the pattern of the other eight.
"Victim's high profile, young Hollywood, no forced entry, no prints."
Hmm.
Where was Mr. Blakely?
Clubbing.
Got home at dawn and found her.
They must have known he was out and got surprised by the girlfriend.
That's a big escalation.
Where's The Shadow now?
Kaiser.
He insisted on riding in the ambulance.
It happened before I got here.
What'd they get?
"3 grand in cash, and take a look."

Then what?
Back to Careless Talk and carrots?
Don't know.
Swain's talking about another feature.
Air-raid wardens.
There'll be slop.
I don't know.
- Here.
I'll get you a real desk.
Marry you.
- Get out.
Horace:
Get outta here.
"- Fuck, I didn't see that."
Horace:
Get outta here.
Fucking backgammon.
"Oh, shit."
Here come these two rummies.
- Hi.
Pete:
"Hi, Lenny."
- Hi.
"- Pete, you're gonna serve 'em?"
- Why not?
Fucking Ford.
He's a fucking piece of shit is what he is.
And he's a clumsy motherfucker.
"- Pete, I understand you don't like the president, but the fact is, he never said ""Drop dead, New York."""
"He probably said-- he said something a lot more boring, like,"
I'll veto any bill that includes the bailout of the municipal government of New York.
"- He said it, Jimmy!"
- Okay.
- He said it!
"- All right, all right, Jimmy, why don't you change the subject, huh?"
What else is in the news?
"- Well, Namath going to the Rams."
I mean...
- Who cares?
"- Well, I for one, don't like it."
Anyone care to weigh in?
- Joe Namath has a great tush.
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
What the hell was that?
Everyone okay?
Dirk!
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
"All right, everybody stay where you are."
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
"I'm like ""21 Jump Street."""
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
Where is it?
No way you'll ever find it.
Where is it?
!
Sam Winchester.
Still a bully.
"You, you jocks."
You popular kids.
you always thought you were better than everybody else.
"And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.

I can't fix you.

Yes?
Miss Karla Elliot?
Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?

There you go.
Thank you.
Do it.
That's good.
Mmm.
Ahh!

I have always loved you.

Ya haven't got a warrant.
You just want to get me in some kind of trouble.
Go away!
Go away!
- Come on...
- Just go away!
Mr. Jacob!
- Why do you have to go?
- Because I have to.
I have to go home and get some money.
"So we can buy new books, medicine and food."
And help all the others.
Do you promise to come to my birthday?
I swear.
And I'll be calling you every other day.
Okay?
"And that's not going to be a lot of times, because I'll be home in 8 days."
Perhaps you can take me there one day.
Perhaps.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

What?
I'm trying to sleep.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."
- Wow.
- Instant classic.
- Wow.
- That was really scary.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I was very scared there for a minute.
"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.
Who's Brent Hoffman?
He was my favorite cat.
"You... you had to put him down, huh?"
"Uh, no, no."
He was eaten by two of my other cats.
Really hard to watch.
"Hey, I really appreciate you guys coming to one of my sing-alongs finally."
- Yeah.
- It's fun.
"And as a ""thank you,"""
I've got some extra tickets to the Rihanna concert this weekend.
Do you guys wanna go?
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun.
"Who is that, though?"
"Yeah, I'm excited, though."
"What do you mean, ""who is that""?"
"she's light-skinned, with the butt."
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
I swear I didn't do it.
Who did this?
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.
Let the attrocities end with me.
You must save our men.
Let me be the last man to die.
Leave no one.
- Father...
- Kill me.
You bastard!
You came looking for your father.
Kill me now.
How dare you kill my man Cuddappah Raja?
Now kill me.
"You said he'll come as your saviour, right?"
I will kill him infront of your eyes.
and put his dead body under Gocha's feet.
"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.
Kill him.
He is my son Velu.
Vetri Velu.
"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
MARSHALL:
"Old man Marshall, as long as you're still married to Lily, you're doing just fine."
"Sir, this is on us."
Sorry the wings were so hot.
"Oh, no, dear."
It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger's.

Yeah.
This is something that only really happens in winter.
"But, I wonder if Saho can knows this place."
Ah.
Maybe the fog isn't a good thing if you are waiting to meet someone.
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Katsuragi Saho.
She's really pretty.
I met Saho-san at her high school's culture festival.
Fumi-chan came to see us about how my club uses tarot cards.
Yeah!
She is like my teacher!
Saho-san knows so much!
I even learned how to use tarot cards!
Look!
I have my cards!
Does anyone want me to tell the future?

Please take it!
"Xiamu, she has been fall in love with you for a long time!"
Consider I have taken it.
Sorry!
Is this the place?
It can't be wrong.
Why did Zhang Jingyu tell us to go for this place?
This place is not bad!

Let's just go home!
It's okay!
I'm here with you.
What is going on?
Yawang!

Go to sport field and run 10 kilometers!
You deserve it!
"Girl who not go home in the midnight, is a bad girl."
"Xiaotian, the time has passed."
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"

- No.
You're still the best!

I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what...

Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
- I don't know.
- Grunge band out of Kentucky.
Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.
Thanks.
- My God.
- What?
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.
- You must have that one.
- No.
For my mom.
This was her favorite group when she was my age.
It's signed by Belinda.
This would be the perfect graduation present.
"I've been looking all week long, and I couldn't find anything."
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?
From college.
From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.
- This was fate.
- I think it was.
"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
I'm a lucky man.
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
Uh...
Lobster truck is here.
Hm.
"An hour ago, I found Mr. Myers down in the E.R. washing the feet of a homeless guy."
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Reminds me of my Uncle Ben...
"Goes to mass every day, twice on Sundays."
Nobody calls him crazy or that he has some syndrome.
You believe in God?
I was raised Catholic.
It never leaves you.
I pray sometimes... mostly for the mets.
God's record there is pretty spotty.
- What's going on?
- Anything?
Who brought Mr. Janson out here?
- I can see!
- You can see?
Jacob brought him for lobster.
Ha!
"Jacob, I can see!"
I can see!
All praise to Hashem!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
"I touched Larry, and Larry can see."
This is a fact.
"Look, as scientists, you have to accept hard evidence."
Larry has graves' disease.
That's why he was blind.
We treated him with a steroid that reduced the swelling...
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Shut up.
- He totally knows.
"- My point is it took Elliott a year to say he loved me, and another year to say it without using a cartoon voice."
"I think I should be ready for a guy who shows emotions,right?"
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Don't you think?
Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Dad.
Um...
"You know,I found a strand of your hair on my jacket."
"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.
"I love that you work here,and that your hair smells."
Thank you.
"Oh,can we go for a walk or something?"
Yeah.
Is that...?
Get a cramp?
You okay?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight.
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
"Don't mind me, Joyce."
I've worked the Samaritans' Christmas bazaar.
I know misery loves company.
I just feel so alone.
"Listen, I was actually on my way to a coffee morning."
A really nice crowd.
Why don't you come along?
Thank you.
"well, well, if it isn't Miss marple herself."
I thought I couId smell cat piss.
Looks like we're going to have to up the ante.
"- DeIphiniums are looking good, Margaret."
"- Thanks, Barb."
"This way, Joyce."
Come along.
Quiet as you can.
Baby asleep upstairs.
"- Joyce, hi."
- Pam.
"- Oh, my God."
What happened?
"- Oh, yoga."
You left so quickly the other day.
Is everything...
OK?
"Erm, fine."
you could fit a whole salmon into this one.
I Iove the coIour-coordinated Iids.
"I think we've got just the thing for you in here, Joyce."
Beretta nine-miIIimetre.
"Good, solid pistol."
Squeeze off a full clip and you can stop a Fiat Panda at 50 yards.
What the hell are you thinking?
"It's war, Jomar."
We can get rid of the heavy water once and for all.
- We don't have a choice!
- I don't believe that.
What do we really know about the Germans?
Do we know how far they have come?
I will try to find out.
Do that!
"- Lise, are you looking forward to the concert?"
- Yes.
To hear Beethoven?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Concert on Saturday.
- Thank you!
There's a concert on Saturday.
Here you go.
Good afternoon.
Ellen Henriksen.
I'm arranging the concert.
- Arvid Fladmoe.
- Kristoffer Kleive.
I hope you had a nice trip.
"8 kg in the hull, close to the engines."
Approximately 45 minutes after departure.
Friday is the worst day.
The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
- Both:
As fuck!
Look at Tommy.
This is what I'm saying.
"""Practicing with my boys, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola."""
- God.
- And when was that?
Yesterday.
What?
Get the fuck out of here.
- ( doorbell dings )
"- Oh, shit, I'll get that."
These motherfuckers practicing without me.
"( sighs ) Come on, Ricky, they in Boston, man."
"Well, shit, Edelman lives in LA and Gronk lives here in Miami."
"Last time I checked, Amendola was in Botswana."
"Yet, they get the call and I get the proverbial stiff arm?"
"- Yeah, yeah, you're right."
- That's bullshit.
"You're right, you're right."
Fuck Brady.
Fuck him.
I'ma unfollow his ass any motherfucking way.
You know what?
I'ma set up a practice of my own.
Just fucking go to...
"Hey, T!"
- Yeah?
- Grab me a group together.
"And not that busted-ass quarterback from last time, all right?"
"Who, JaMarcus?"
He used to play for the Raiders.
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I didn't know cats could smile.
(sighing ) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
(laughing )
Alice.NNothing can harm you there.
Nyou can always wake up.
Like this.
(laughing ) Ow!
(sighing )
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""Nwas wearing a codfish on your head?"
-Would you wear it?
N-Alice.
a corset is like a codfish.
not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.Nl didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
Never since I can remember.
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
My Barefoot Cinderella.
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
And then you'll say do you wanna take a chance.
And stay with me forever.
No one'll ever be more beautiful.
"My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella."
[Audience cheering]
[Music stops]
You rocked.
Not hard when I'm with you.
"Hey, hey, hey."
I'm Hannah.
Hannah Montana ladies and gentlemen.
And apparently her new boyfriend.
Why is it always the guitar player?
Why not a nice cameraman like my nephew Lenny?
"But seriously, I'm happy for you Hannah."
And what's your name?
"Ah, you don't wanna know my name."
Come on.
You kissed her on national TV.
What are you shy all of a sudden?
Come on what's your name?
-Jesse.
-Jesse!
There you have it.
Hannah and Jesse America's new sweethearts.
Good night everybody.
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
Bye.

Thanks very much.
-(CUP smashing )N-(ALL laughing ) please.
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""
- And a final consonant.
- And a consonant.
Thank you.
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."
I heard Cary is back with you guys.
"- Yeah, starts today."
- Oh.
He's a good guy.
Wish him luck.
"So, we'll need you out here until we get an office cleared out,"
- if you're all right with that.
- I am.
Good.
It'll just be a few weeks.
"Welcome back, Cary."
Whew.
AN:
Yeah?
"Um, is this FE Construction?"
Hello?
Who is this?
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.
?
[ Lounge Piano ]
?
"I'm sorry, kid, I, uh,"
"I don't know, man."
6 months on the sidelines.
I guess I still have a few blisters where I used to have calluses.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Oh, no?"
Then what is it?
You're about to be a dad.
You know?
You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.
Like asphalt is hard.
Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.
"If there's one thing I'm sure of, is that you and Savannah are going to be great parents."
"Charge by the hour, Doc?"
Aah!
Josie?
!
Josie!
Aah!
No...
"Oh, my God."
Eleven.
Aah!
So what do we know?
"Our father's dead, daughter's missing, but we may have caught a break here."
Kelly?
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
Used to babysit me.
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.
- Why can't we go into town?
Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
(SPUTTERING)
We have company.
"Have a look, Bayard."
BAYARD:
Bielle.
(BARKING)
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I.
"But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece."
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
"I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size."
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
-Hatter.
-Size.
Fez.
I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
-Cheshire.
"-How's the arm, love?"
All healed.
"Goodbye, sweet hat."
What's happening?
Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."
I...
I...
I thought you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"
Why isn't this working?
"She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long."
Let me out!
What can I do?
You can let me do it.
Mom!
Krista?
I'm sorry.
Butchered in bed in hollywood's
Premier sex playground-- Lenny stein--
"Music producer, maverick executive,"
"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
"But Ms. Viola, there many dangers along the way."
"Hazard-no, challenges."
-As soon as it comes.
"Okay, find Uncle Ramon ..."
"Send him to bring friends, Adélie how he can."
-Is ...
Do not forget the family motto.
The RE-MASH.
"Come on, Uncle Bud, we have too many fish to catch."
"-So, what news?"
-Ruins.
"Every corner, every direction, completely blocked."
There are rumors of people thinking the unthinkable.
"Noah, are calling The Iceberg's End."
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.
-We can not ...
Return- to seek hundred times.
-There is no escape.
"-Thousands of times if necessary, there is always a way out."
"It does have, and right there."
"Ice, no ice, but it has ice tone and testing ..."
Let me help you.
"Ready, you can go."
"Erik, no!"
Bounce!
"You saw, you saw?"
"Never, do it again."
"Father, I flew!"
-Erik.
-I flew!
"I beat my wings, was very quick."
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours of light left.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!

JONES:
"We're on an island, all alone."
"Look, we appreciate the imagery and all that, but this is no time for existential metaphors."
No.
Really.
The pier's been washed out.
"Summer, you're okay !"
I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
Michelle's pregnant.
Dad?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
I don't recognize anybody's voice.
Don't make any mistakes here or do anything stupid.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
- Cut them loose.
- All right.
OFFICER:
"All right, this way out."
MARTINEZ:
Let's go.
[DOOR OPENS]
"- Hey, Greg."
"- Hey, John."
KELLY:
How you feeling?
MEDAVOY:
Okay.
"You know, all right."
John....
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
"John, when you got separated, did you give that a lot of thought?"
"Did you have it pretty well worked- out, what you were going to do?"
- It was her call.
- It was Laurie's idea?
Yeah.
"For me, you marry, you marry for life."
Me too.
"You know, that's exactly me too."
"But when it happened I was so busy being pissed off and hurt, I wasn't listening."
She was trying to tell me why she wanted to leave.
But you know what?
She was right.
Slapped you!
"You probably think I'm finished, huh?"
!
"No, there's another one!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!"
There's a slap for you!
"Slap, slap, slap!"
"Yeah, there you go!"
"Here's a little ""reach around the back of the head"" slap!"
"Oh, God, please!"
"You have to get away, he won't ever stop!"
"Oh, I'm going slap happy!"
"# I'm goin' slap, slap happy #"

They're here!
The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy!"
- All right!
"- All right, Wendy!"
Who's the male lead?
"No surprise there, it's Bridon!"
"- All right, Bridon!"
"- Cool, Bridon!"
I get to be a stand-in!
"Congratulations, Bridon!"
Guess we'll be working a lot together!
"Yeah, great."
Goddamn it!
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
GIGGLING

"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
What do you mean?
Have you heard of the killer Chou Lien-chan?
Chou Lien-chan
"No, and I have no quarrel with him"
He's chief disciple of Tiger Yeh
"You killed Tiger Yeh, and he'll come for you!"
It's been 30 years-why bring that up?
Show me your stuff before you die

He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
"No, stop!"
Look out for the cow!
"Come on, no, not there!"
please stop.
"No, stop!"
We can't go there yet.
people just aren't ready for you.
That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?

"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."

This'll keep you honest.

How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?

That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.

What were you looking at?
"Just looking, Barbuda."
I see.
How are you doing in school?
"The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda."
Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.

Didn't we have this conversation before?
- I posted notices on every floor.
- That's not enough.
"At the end of the day, you're responsible, not the tenant."
My man!
What's happening?
"- Maggie, my buddy Mickey."
- What's up?
- Mickey... and Daisy.
- Daisy:
Fuck you...!
"Daisy, what's happening?"
This is Berna.
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.
Yoon.
"Yoon, he said the crack doesn't look good."
It looks retouched.
The photo is unrealistic.
Okay.
One more thing
"I am sorry to bring this up, but you forgot to erase the finger of the guy who's lifting the athlete's leg."
Shit!
Don't try to make any excuses.
Shitty work is shitty work.
Shitty work because you suck!
No excuses will do.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Are you listening?
Yeah.
About Adidas.
The 2nd lot.
"The set with the girl, they want to take a break."
Who's doing it then?
Nobody.
It's just a break.
Just a break?
No such thing.
"Who is doing it, Je?"
Jerd.
Hello Peng.
"Hey, I heard you lost it?"
You heard about that?
"Even though I'm in another office, when Je got chewed out, I knew about that."
Accidents happen sometimes.
But some people who are hit by car once are handicapped for the rest of their lives.
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
DOC:
Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it.
Don't move.
There.
Now that's my good girl.
Candy.
That's for you.
Take it.
That's it.
Next.
What is it this time?
Want me to take a look?
Depressor.
Now that's a big boy.
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
- Did you ask if Maurice works there?
"Not yet, but it's an Arab club, so Natanel, forget your disposable forks"
- and take off your skullcap.
- Are you crazy?
- Or wait in the hotel.
- It's my right to wear it.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
"- Yes, you are."
"Fine, I'm shouting."
Happy?
I know this music.
Isn't this...?
What is this place?
"Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-."
Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite.
Israelis?
- They're onto us.
- Should I take it off?
- You're paranoid.
- So why are you whispering?
Tel Aviv?
Are you from Tel Aviv?
- Jerusalem.
- Why didn't you say so?
Menashe!
All Israelis are our guests.
We'll treat you like kings.
I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast.
What's going on here?
"- Hey, isn't this song..."
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
Like I told you:
"Hit me again, I said."
Do you remember?
Nobody knows what the girl has gone through.
But now we must speak about it.
"The truth - and nothing but the truth, so help me God."
Pauline Kraka.
"No, it's not for me."
I have only written here.
Poste restante.
Mr Harald Brennemann
I have no identity card.
- Maybe you have his forwarding address?
- Where has he moved to?
I don't know.
To the West.
"Brennemann, Brennemann..."
Brennemann...
Brennemann...
"No, but there are a bunch of letters there."
"Christ, no!"
- He never picked them up.
- He can still come by.
"- Please, I'd like to have them back."
"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."
"- But please, I no longer have an address."
They could get into the hands of strangers.
"Please, give me the letters."
- Please!
Nanteuil.
What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.
"Fandor, my boy!"
My boy!
Juve?
Is that you?
It's me in the flesh.
"When Lady Beltham's hotel blew up, you were found dead under the rubble."
"This is what I have made believe, in agreement with the Director of the force, Mr Havard."
"Immediately after the explosion, several of my men were found dead, some shredded."
One of them was unrecognizable.
"Boy, what a night!"
I'm so glad that is over with.
"- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever."
- In sports...
Together forever.
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.
Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
I believe that my prayers will be heard there!
How can the medicine work when you are hungry?
Are you hungry?
You are starving for last two days.
And you claim that you are not hungry?
I wiIIjust come back.
"O God, I have looked for him everywhere!"
But I couldnt find him.
I dont know how he is doing now.
"God, you have bestowed me with everything."
But without him its useless!
"God, I want to find him!"
"Yes, I do!"
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
"Brother, please sit down."
Mr. Kirshna is going to serve the offering!
Master!
Master!
"What happened to you, sir?"
What happened to you?
"Krishna, ourfate betrayed.."
..us once you left us!
I lost everything!
Your madam also left me!
"Yeah, I know!"
I know!
"Sir, I know all of it."
You have met me after such a Iong time!
Master!
How is little miss?
He is Krishna!
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.
"More than snow, more than Simeon - even this old body is strong in my control."
Argh!
Do you feel it?
Winter is coming!
Argh!
Winter is coming!
"No, you must fight!"
"Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!"
Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.
Just set up.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Exports.
Imports.
Portugal.
"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
Others?
I do not know.
Are all there ...
It is sad.
Addons last question ...
"Addons What's the first, purchased by you,"
"This site us, and why?"
How the hell do you know?
Buying goods online.
Addons Let me refresh your memory to tell you.
I've never bought anything like that.
What's this?
"Addons you score ""zero"", Max."
I've never bought anything like that.
Addons The correct answer is ...
Addons 1: you are at level 1.
You fall for the exam 7 times.
Addons 2:
"Profile of the most frequently visited is ""Leeps Jennifer""."
Addons And you've seen pictures of 234 times.
Now obviously.
Addons Question 3:
Your order solution genitals.
Addons Once you come from Poland.
He was 17.
"Addons short: dirty people like you, interesting disease."
Well done.
Confidential.
I do not buy it.
"Addons Gwen, your question starts now."
I do not think that there is a game.
Problems that are too personal.
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
"Yeah, true."
Might as well.
How'd it go with the sponsors?
Not well.
They love you.
They just don't think it's a great fit.
What did they say?
They weren't impressed with your last fight.
"I told them you were sick, but the real issue is the stuff with your dad."
Ryan.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Lisa?"
I already went to fucking prison.
I know.
I think it's just getting people to understand what you've been through.
It's none of their fucking business.
That's personal.
I don't want to talk about that.
Maybe there's a way to do it that doesn't suck.
Let me think about it.
All right.
[Indistinct chatter]
Alvey:
Yes?
[Door opens]
Mario Goldsmith's here.
"Oh, yeah, send him in."
- The poison pen.
"- How are you, Alvey?"
I'm great.
I'm great.
Have a seat.
Thanks for coming.
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
What's yourshow tonight?
"Here, this is formaking a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.
These youngsters...
You know how my wife can get...
Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"
Don't shout.
I need a driver.
"Can, have you gone nuts?"
Yourfoolish aunt didn't tell me...
"Thanks to Ahmet, she doesn't know."
Come in...
Come in.
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
-ls the mission possible?
"- lfwe were given this mission, it is possible."
Do you understand what all this might end with?
"If everything is all right, I'll get the USSR Hero Star."
Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.
is the line from the Chapayev movie?
And I'm not good at singing.
Neither am I.
Join in.
-And I do not know any more lines.
- Neither do I.
Still go on singing.
Let's go overthe same line again.
"Marysya, sweetie!"
is it him?
"-Misha, is that you?"
"- Master, it is us, Grisha and Valera."
Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
Hold on!
"You gotta be kiddin', buddy, I got your message."
"This fuckin' guy's crazy, man."
Wait until I get that fuckin' Johnny and Tony...
I'm gonna cut them both off.
Somebody get me out of here!
Get me out!
[Mourning dove calling]
[Dog barking]
[Dog growling]

"Hey, wait-wait a minute..."
"No, no, what are you doin'?"
Are you crazy...
Don't do that!
Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."
What would your father say?
"Look, Betty, I don't care about that."
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.
"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"
You mean now?
Twenty-six... so far.
"You can't afford not to believe me, Avon."
- How the hell did she get off the Liberator?
- I don't know.
"Look, we both saw her."
It was Servalan.
You're just running away from the truth.
"All right, I believe you."
I didn't want her to die like that anyway.
I need... to kill her myself.
- Yablonski.
- Ho.
Hutchinson.
"Hey, Hutch, this is your lucky day."
They finally forwarded this from your old unit.
- I'd glad I got it before I go home.
- Horner.
"Klinger, Maxie."
Mulcahy.
Maxie?
Maxie.
Maxie.
Whose idea was it to run him off without a wedding?
Shut up!
"Look out, sire!"

"- Hey, Ponch."
Wake up.
- Why?
What are you doing?
Clocking a sparrow?
She's beautiful.
"Tall, tan, legs up to here."
You better keep your eyes on the car in front of you.
She wears these short shorts and little flip-flops.
And she's even got sexy feet.
Feet?
- How long you known her?
- She just moved into the trailer park.
I haven't met her yet.
Did you see what almost happened to me?
"It was only almost, Ponch."
I'm gonna give that bozo a piece of my mind.
And maybe more.
"What's wrong, officer?"
I was only going 45.
Maybe 50.
Okay.
"It's possible that I was going over a little more, but it's..."
- But...
"- Hey, mister."
"- When you're on the freeway, you..."
"- Hey, Ponch, the traffic, okay?"
It won an Oscar.
Rocky IV has Stallone in it... and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.
"Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow."
Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
- Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
- It's true.
"Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say."
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.
"In park, but no emergency brake."
Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.
Mountain range!
Professor!
I am occupied.
"But, it is urgent."
"Cicchirini, Go to the devil, I am occupied."
The tele...
I do not grant interviews.
"Professor, get away from the tele, they can all see you."
They see that I. I am the greater surgeon of the world.
Professor is tele of closed circuit.
No!
The great surgeon has been deceived.
-All ready ones?
We are going to do a serenade to him.
-I will sing in Do.
-All On guard.
You in Re.
I in Do and you in Re.
"Attention. 1, 2 and 3."
"Mountain range, mountain range."
The Professor wanted the mountain range.
Cicchirini cut the roll to him.
And tomorrow we will see him by tele.
"Eh, beautiful."
Italia.
Viva Italia!
Now they are going away to find out.
"Mountain range, mountain range."
The Professor wanted the mountain range.
Cicchirini cut the roll to him.
And tomorrow we will see him by tele.

"It's our pleasure to welcome... the president ofTung Yuan Financial Corp., Mr. Tony Weng... the chairman of Rotary Club, Mr. Peter Chu..."
Cover him up.
Keep everything under control.
Red alert!
red alert!
Tony Weng's been shot on the foating platform.
The shot came from around the fishingjunks.
The killer is probably nearby.
All units!
Prepare to seal offthe area.
Mr. Weng fainted.
Everything's fine.
Please enjoy your day.
Chang!
"Chang, look over there!"
An explosion!
Let's check it out
"Chang, we can't lose him now!"
Freeze!
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
Go down the hall.
What happened?
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
(SYLVIE GASPING)
Athos!
Let me help you.
Where is Grimaud?
Dead.
I shot him.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Show me.
He was there.
I shot him.
He fell right there.
The others are in grave danger.
GUARD:
The Governor is here to see you.
I'm not receiving visitors.
You have not heard what I have come to say.
"When this is over, Philippe, and justice has been served, you'll pay for how I have been treated!"
"I am a son of France, a prince of the blood."
And yet you lock me up here like an animal!
(CHOKING)
(FERON BREATHING HEAVILY)
"It doesn't get any easier, this killing."
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You better swap clothes with him.
(GROANS)
Hurry.
We don't have much time.
GASTON:
I take it the King doesn't know about this?
No.
You really think it's necessary to go after them?
"If it's the slightest chance they are walking into a trap, yes."
"Look, it's a little after 6:00."
I'll catch a ride and see you out there.
Bye.
- John.
- Yeah?
"The Balkans peace council is ""comprised"""
"or ""composed"" of ten members?"
Twelve members.
"Oh, right."
Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
"- What do you think, Cy?"
- I'll lead with it.
- Great.
I'll see you Monday.
This'll make them sweat.
It's good.
What?
- I gotta go.
"- Come on, John."
"It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party."
I can't.Mary's waiting for me.
"It's a big house, isn't it?"
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.Take a look around.
So you two were in the room then?
Were you sleeping together?
- Did he tell you he slept with me?
"- No, I'm just asking."
What did you do then?
I don't talk about that kind of stuff.
I see.
But how did you get out when I was outside the door?
Ask him yourself.
Did you two by any chance walk over me?
We came out anyway.
So you walked over me?
Why is that so important?
We got out and that's it.
"You're mean, Sunhee."
Two women shouldn't be fighting dirty over a man.
The choice should be the woman's.
This is so boring.
This is why hell is so boring!
Don't get mad.
I'm fine.
So you really are just a woman.
The phone has been turned off.
You'll be connected to...

Where the hell are you?

"Whatever it is, it's really knocked him for six."
I think I know what it was.
- Really?
Pilchards.
What?
- They must have been on the turn.
"Well, don't look so worried."
Anyone can make a mistake.
Why won't you take my money?
"If you hadn't allowed us to pick your fruit, we'd never have made all this."
I'm not going until you let me pay for it.
Not for the WI and not for you.
For the fleet.
It would be lovely to see you at our meeting this evening.
"Busy, I'm afraid."
All the more reason.
Everyone gets so much from it.
"Without it, I sometimes think I'd curl up in bed and never get up."
Hello.
"Thank you, driver."
"- That's all right, miss."
Excuse me...
"Oh, Mr Wilson."
Er...
Spencer.
Hi.
Would you like to try some of our jam?
Why not?
I helped make it.
Try that.
Mmm.
Delicious!
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
"Clearly, I"
Will go sailing
No more
Mom!
"Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?"
"What, dear?"
What was that?
Never mind!
"Buzz, the coast is clear."
"Buzz, where are you?"
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
Let's go.
Really?
That is so interesting.
"Would you like some tea, Mrs Nesbitt?"
Buzz!
- [Piano]
- Notthat.
[Stops]
Buddy?
I have always stood by you.
I campaigned foryou when I was pregnant.
"During Checkers, when Ike wanted you out, I told you to fight."
"This is different, Dick."
You've changed.
"You've grown more bitter, like you're atwarwith the world."
You weren'tthatway before.
"I'm 50 years old now, Dick."
Howmany millions of miles have I traveled?
Howmany millions of peoples' hands have I shaked that ljust don't like?
Howmany thank-you notes have I written?
"It's as if I, I don't know, justwentto sleep a long time ago... and missed the years between."
You shouldn't play with people's feelings.
Is that real what you do on the phone?
Isn't it just another game?
"We're just mammals, too."
Sure...
It's good exercise and it pays well.
Do you think we could live like this on a nurse's salary?
"Phone sex is hygienic, impersonal and funny."
There's food in the kitchen.
Hello?
I love your voice.
What's your name?
Jes...
Mr. Yes.
- You'll never be lonely again.
Lusty Terhi will help you.
What's wrong?
"Fine, Mr. Yes."
You want to listen?
You're on top of me.
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Kiss me all over...
I'm taking your ah...
Isn't this great?
"Are you still there, Mr. Yes?"
"I'd like to - love, for real."
Me too.
Time to go home.
Tired?
"No, this is fun."
You're a strange Finn.
They're usually as lazy as monkeys.
Says he picked up his personal effects.
What about the super saying they fought?
-We're gonna work on that in a minute.
"-John, this guy gets zero rhythm."
Zero.
"Razor, shirts, couple of pictures."
"Which would kind of be what I told you, right?"
-You were only there once?
-Right.
-Super says you were there twice.
-Let's break that down.
Super says I was there twice.
He's a liar.
Says he heard fighting.
Maybe he did.
She had scumbag friends...
-... that'swhysheworkedforus.
-We're getting different stories.
You say you were not there before you went to pick up your stuff?
"-Correct, for the second time."
-You altered a crime scene.
You admit lying about it.
"Hey, John, don't talk to me like some street skell here."
"You guys want to screw me for this, you go ahead."
I'm done talking to you.
-Yeah?
MEDAVOY:
Mrs. Fuentes?
-Yes.
-Detective Medavoy.
Detective Martinez.
-Your husband spoke to Detective Kelly?
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."
How many copies to you want me to buy?
.
-What?
How many letters?
.
-What's that?
Five!
Five!
Five!
He's pestering me!
"Yes, okay!"
"I'll call you later, wait!"
Hey!
You're such a pest!
Give me that!
Hey!
Give that to me!
I'm going with them.
I love you.
But I want to experience life in Canada.
You know that long distance relationships are hard.
About sebastian?
He awaits you in your throne room.
Brother?
Francis.
I'm going to tell you something.
And it will hurt.
I know you're here to elope with mary.
You don't need to.
"All that nonsense about the prophecy,"
It's gone now.
My mother's let it go
For reasons she can explain.
I'm going to tell mary.
"She'll talk to my mother, to nostradamus."
She'll be convinced.
She won't trust catherine.
I don't trust catherine.
"You don't want things to change, to revert."
You're going to play on mary's fear.
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.
She turned to you because she had to.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.
You know it.
And now you know
"Ours did, too."
You're lying.
You entitled son of a bitch.
You.
You're nothing.

Good name.
"So do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
- Excuse me?
- Hey.
Eyes on the road.
(Horn blares)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"You didn't, actually."
(Siren whoops)
Oh.
Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""eyes on the road."""
Screwdriver.
(Grunts)
License and registration.
This is very soft...
like velvet.
Naturally.
It's pure silk.
"It cost us 4,000 Rupees."
"Sleeping in this is so much fun, as if..."
"As much fun as it is in your husband's arms, right?"
Don't take of fence.
I said that only because...
"I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere silk, on a mat with my husband."
Hand me the pillow-cover.
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.
Must be your elder brother then?
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.
He was my husband.
Was?
Is he no more?
Gosh!
Don't say that!
Have you had a drivorsh?
"It's ""divorce"", aunty."
Not drivorsh.
He's pretty good looking.
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.
May I say something?
A young couple can separate... but parents must never be done apart.
Never mind that.
Go and see what Bharti is doing.
- Cat?
- Mm-mm.
- Bird?
- Mm-mm.
- Wolf?
- Mm.
"Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?"
Just a cat.
Just a cat?
You never talk about your patients that way.
"What, you have to put one down?"
No.
I wasn't going to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- You promise you won't get mad?
About a cat?
Why would I get mad about a cat?
"It was Adalind's cat, and I know that you don't like her, and she knows that too."
She didn't even want me to tell you.
Let me see that.
"Nick, what's the matter with you?"
Take it easy.
How long ago did this happen?
"Today, just before lunch."
"Baby, I get scratches all the time."
Not like this you don't.
- You don't understand.
"- Yeah, I don't understand."
You're getting all worked up about nothing.
You don't know her like I do.
Okay?
"You know, you said that once before."
They attract.
Simply great!
I deeply regret to have called you.
I won't make this mistake again!
A lady has come to see you.
"All right, come"
Didn't I say I'd drop in someday?
And here I am.
You did say.
But I never expected you.
I don't know how to welcome you.
Anybody there?
"Yes, sir?"
What would you have?
Hot or cold?
Any cold drink.
"- Two cold drinks.- l will bring now, sir."
How is your father?
is that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.
He is my only friend.
Which is why I have kept his photograph.
But the walls in this room are still empty.
Why don't you fill it up with some good photographs?
Shall I ?
"Yes, Mr Daaga?"
What's up?
Don't you wory.
What am I here for?
So what ifyour men are guilty of murder?
I am there to save them.
See this bungalow!
I sold it to Dick.
- Hundred grand.
It's his problem.
- I don't think so.
"Numberthree, which is probably the most important of all,"
I'm leaving tonight for good.
"Now, questions?"
[ Tires Screech ]
You fucked up the whole thing!
You screwed it all up!
- Stop it!
- You brain-damaged fool!
"God, and i picked out a car and everything!"
"Hey, now listen."
"If I didn't do this, we'd be in jail or at the river bottom..."
- with bricks taped to our wrists.
- [ Groans ]
- And you know it.
"- Oh, my God."
You're so stupid.
- Oh!
"- Oh, Crystal."
- We are under surveillance.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Yes.
Last night I stopped by a convenience store.
"A cop pulled in behind me, he got out, he followed me in... and then he pretended to get a cup of coffee!"
Did he pretend to get a doughnut?
"- Oh, you know--"
- You are nuts!
- You need to see a psychiatrist.
"- Oh, I'm nuts?"
Ah.
"Yeah, I-I wouldn't know."
She and I are
Keeping our creative lives separate right now.
"Uh, you might wanna discuss this one,"
Since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
"You know what, dad?"
I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um...
"I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring,"
"But I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like,"
Perhaps you'd like to invite her.
"Actually, I'm gay."
"So if I was going, which I'm not,"
Then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh...
Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him-
Please stop acting like
You and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um...
I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that
"Closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um..."
My suicide attempt.
We didn't even get the Joni Mitchell.
"Oh, don't, yeah."
Food and Drink.
"Food and Drink, OK."
I can tell you you will be looking for cocktails.
You have ten seconds to confer.
OK!
Single word ones.
Single ones...
"Mojito, screwdriver..."
Erm...
Time's up.
I didn't hear a lot of cocktails there.
Are you not big cocktail drinkers?
They are.
These two love them!
But we like two-word cocktails!
That's a bit inconvenient then.
Yeah!
"Simon, in the middle, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, remember those passes."
You're looking for cocktails.
Reveal the hive.
Mojito.
"Mojito, correct."
Helen.
Screwdriver.
BUZZER
"Oh, you are locked out of the hive!"
"With 32 seconds left to go, and two passes to go!"
"You wanted to get screwdriver there, but you can't quite get it, because there's no R. Bad luck."
You've got one point for mojito.
"Well, good."
I'll deposit it and bring you your receipt.
"Now, that's twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at two dollars."
That's right.
Looking for a stock to buy?
Why?
Do you know of a good one?
Have you heard of Wentworth Drug?
I don't use drugs.
How much does it sell for?
Two dollars.
I never buy cheap stocks.
"Well, this one may become expensive."
Somebody just bought twenty thousand shares.
"Yes, so I see."
"You just bought twenty thousand at two, Mr. Sabourin."
Thank you.
You bought it.
What if it goes down to a dollar?
Then I'll buy more.
Look.
Still think it will go to a dollar?
I've got to get some.
Mr. O'Hara!
"Yes, Mrs. Ryan?"
Get me fifty thousand shares at two.
You'll never get it at two.
Not after that announcement.
Look!
Three and a half...
Three and five eighths...
Three and seven eighths.
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

"- Total shock, which I love."
"- I'm like, ""Wait."
"What?"""
- What's happening?
- Wait a minute.
What?
"- ""Why are you grabbing on me?"" - ""What's going on?"""
There was previously a scene there with Mike and a transvestite.
- You can catch that on the DVD too.
"- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
- In the deleted scenes.
- That's what I was recovering from.
"Are most of the scenes that are deleted on there, or did you pick and choose?"
We got a great scene with Kat and Jesus.
We've got Trannie Tris.
- Thank God.
- Trannie Tris.
- All the oldies but goodies are there.
- Do you say:
"- ""When I say 'Jesus' you say 'Christ""'?"
- That's in there.
Yes.
- That was fun.
- Yup.
Do you have the bathroom scene at the?
In the Catholic school.
Is that in there?
"- No, I'm afraid not."
- No.
"- That was kind of omitted, right?"
"- Oh, God."
- That was fun.
"Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?"
Does this make us friends?
Something up here after all.
-Him?
-You.
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
What about the others?
Can I help them?
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose I don 't know what to do.
"You'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny."
I think that's what Dr. Ianning would have wanted.
That's what it means to be free.
"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
OK...
Here we go.
Focus.
Speed.
I am speed.
"One winner, 42 losers."
I eat losers for breakfast.
Breakfast.
"Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast."
A little breck-y could be good for me.
"No, no, no, stay focused."
Speed.
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.
I am lightning!
"Hey, Lightning!"
You ready?
I...
I think what you're doing is wonderful.
You came to see him?
He'll be here.
Just have to wait.
Come here.
Come here.
What's the matter?
Something wrong?
Myocardial metastases.
Cancer of the heart muscle.
"Super rare, right?"
They wrote an article about me in a magazine.
"It's in my room, if you want to see it."
"Apparently, I could croak from one day to the next... from one minute to the next."
- Jeremy.
- Nathan.
"What do you do, Nathan?"
I'm a lawyer.
Do you know if he's going to be long?
"The first doc I saw, you know what he called it?"
"""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."""
Wow.
Can you believe that guy?
"You and me, we're gonna slap that that son-of-a-bitch with a lawsuit."
What do you say?
"Legally, that's not exactly my bag."
"Jeremy, hello."
- Up already?
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.
"- Yeah, thanks."
- It's never been about sex.
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.
Having sex now will ruin everything.
You're a very sick man.
Mmm.
"Johnson's been around both leagues, but seems to have found a home here in the Bronx."
He's leading the American league with a 2.34 ERA and 24 strikeouts.
And strike three.
That makes strikeout number 25 for Johnson in this young season.
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh.
Great.
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.
- One glass.
"- All right, one glass."
Same score?
This is good.
Sweet.
I normally don't like sweet.
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...
Would you mind terribly if we muted the TV?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
All right.
Would it be all right if I sat down?
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.
- Good game?
- I can't hear.
Cheaper than plastic surgery.
How's the bite?
I'm not howling at the moon.
There is no moon.
- How did it go?
- What?
The meeting.
It was boring.
You went?
Yeah.
"I just said it was boring, didn't I?"
"Sorry, they didn't give me a card."
You went for you or because you promised me you would?
Is this guy gonna look like hamburger?
More like ground chuck.
I went for you.
- You're gonna need some more people.
- Why?
"Come on, hard restraints!"
- No IV?
-20 of morphine before he pulled out.
"- Sir, we need you to hold still."
"- Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table."
"-100 of fent, two of Ativan."
"- Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck."
- Could be PCP.
- Or the gunshot wound.
"Sir, we're gonna help you."
But you gotta hold still...
- ... while we get the morphine into you.
"- Okay, pressure 100/80."
"- Pulse, 150."
It's all clear!
"Shooters, with a magazine of 20 rounds, as you were, and a magazine with 30 rounds!"
"Shooters, you may commence fire when you see your target!"
"Shooters, it is time."
You're gonna stand.
What are you doing here?
"Uh, just, uh, checking for drainage problems."
Out here?
"Uh, you know what?"
"It's okay, 'cause, uh, I'm with septic."
He's got a ca--
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Is somebody out there?
Go.
"Go, go."
Give me your jacket.
"- Go, go."
"- Come here, come here."
Okay.
Go.
You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. government project administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
"- 'Cause it's notyou, it's the system."
- [Coughing]
The system won't letyou stop it.
[Boy] That's right.
There's...
There's more atstake here...
- than whatyou wantorwhat I want.
- Then what's the point?
What's the pointof being president?
You're powerless!
- No!
"- No, I'm not powerless."
Because...
"Because I understand the system, I believe I can, uh..."
"I can control it, maybe notcontrol ittotally, buttame itenough to make it do some good."
Sounds like you're talking abouta wild animal.
"Yeah, maybe I am."
"We really must go, Mr. President."
Please.
"- [Girl] Hey, what about the war, man?"
- When you gonna get us out?
[Agent] The old man's moving.
- [Haldeman] Move it.
Getaway.
"- [Nixon] She got it, Bob."
- Nineteen-year-old college kid.
- What?
Who?
She understood something that's taken me 25 years in politics to understand.
"The C.I.A., the Mafia, those Wall Street bastards."
- Sir?
- The beast.
Who do you think you are?
- You can't treat those boys like animals.
- I'll treat them any way I like.
"- And if you don't like it, you can leave."
- I will.
"But I warn you if I can get to the authorities, you haven't heard the end."
"Miss Griffith, I demand your resignation immediately."
And you can have it.
- I've been waiting for that.
- Yeah.
Come in.
"- Hello, Miss Griffith."
"- Hello, Jimmy."
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.
Where you going?
I'm leaving.
You're kidding.
"No, I'm not."
First Patsy and then you.
"I'm not quitting you, Jimmy."
I've been fired.
Thompson fired me.
What?
Jimmy.
"Quite a delegation of our boys to see you, chief."
A delegation?
- What do they want?
"- I don't know, sir."
- How did they--?
- They got a hold of Walters.
He seemed a little scared and he told them they could see you.
Look out.
We've got to find the emergency switches.
"You two go that way, and you two go that way."
"Tony, we must eliminate Tia."
You will cause that portable utility panel to run her down.
"Hey, Tia, come here."
Come on.
"That ain't it, right?"
- You found it!
- I knew it was it!
"But, it's spelt wrong."
You guys get dazzler and muscles.
OK.
Come on.
The rest of the money's just arrived.
All right.
I'd better call Gannon.
The cooling system's on.
Switch it off.
We lost it!
What's going on down there?
It's coming back.
"650, 600..."
Gotcha!
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Tony, why are you doing these things?"
Why are you using your powers against me?
What's happened?
Tony pretend to remember Tia.
Lure her to the center of the room and make that crane drop on her.
Tia!
I'm starting to remember.
I started making calls because I didn´t wanna wait.
"I told you, we have a small window of opportunity here."
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
- l have other things to attend to.
- OK.
- ls there anything else?
- That´s it.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
- What´s the security configuration?
- Don´t worry.
We´re handling Nina.
"- Ryan, you know what she´s capable of."
- That´s none of your concern.
- l´m sending you to Medical.
- l´m fine.
- l don´t think you are.
- What´s this about?
We found evidence you´ve been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I´m off here, Jack."
Tell me I´m wrong.
- l didn´t think so.
"- Ryan, I haven´t missed a step. I´m fine."
I have to cover my ass.
I need to get you checked out.
You´re wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah.
I thought you´d wanna know your dad´s back.
- What about Chase?
- I'm seeing Cartoon Head again.
"- Oh, you're not?"
Yeah.
I...
I kept thinking about him.
Wondering what might've happened if we'd stayed together.
What might've happened?
!
He's a paranoid hit man who knocked you about.
- How many more clues d'you need?
- There's another side to him.
- Is it worse?
- He's like a little boy.
With a gun.
"China, you're a delicate precious creature."
I don't want you being taken advantage of and me having to hear about it second-hand.
Nobody is taking advantage of anybody.
"You don't have a blim I could take home, do ya?"
- Course I do.
"- Oh, you're great, you."
You're like me other dad.
"- Your dad never, er?"
"- God, no!"
"Good, good."
Aaaah!
Raargh!
Oooargh!
Raargh!
I don't normally cater for family groups.
I'm nearly done with this baby.
- Today is me last day.
"- That's the beauty of childminding, innit?"
- What's she want?
"- She wants to see me, Damon."
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.
You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.
Oh.
I take it that's not okay with you guys?
ELENA:
I wanna do it.
I wanna meet her.
"If I don't, I know I'll regret it."
Thanks.
Can you hear me?
Thanks for coming.
I'm nervous.
But I'm happy that you're here.
I love you.
[MOUTHS] I love you.
"Hello, Elena."
You look just like her.
It's eerie.
- You've met Katherine?
ISOBEL:
She found me after I turned.
"Genetic curiosity, I suppose."
She would be fascinated by you.
Is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
- Who's my father?
- Not important.
"Vic, come on."
"It's, uh... been a pretty rough ride lately..."
Enough I'm thinking about gettin' off the train.
You wanna give up your badge?
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?
You don't wanna give it up.
–Retirement's been pretty good to you.
–A forced retirement.
Believe me.
I still miss it.
We can hit the links together every day.
What's bothering you now?
"When, uh..."
When we were ridin'... you ever feel like you went too far?
Yeah.
"Couple times, maybe."
Probably.
Definitely.
"Hell, you can't always land just right."
Goin' too far will get you fired.
Not goin' far enough will get you killed.
I never lost any sleep over it though.
"Anyway, we always did more good than bad, right?"
Right.
That's the key.
–Yeah.
"That's him, all right."
–Yeah.
–Good.
–Anything else we can do?
She was such a nice girl.
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
No.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
Yeah.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
He doesn't belong to any gang.
"We follow you no more, Bloody Big Head."
How dare you?
Off with his head!
"Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death."
"However, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands."
"No one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you."
You will not have a friend in the world.
"Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will."
"Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland."
At least we have each other.
(GASPS)
(EX CLAIMING)
"Majesty, please!"
Kill me!
Please!
But I do not owe you a kindness.
-STAYNE:
Take off my head!
-He tried to kill me.
-Majesty!
Please!
Please!
-He tried to kill me.
-I offer you my head!
-He tried to kill me!
"Oh, the Frabjous Day!"
Callou!
Callay!
(FUTTERWACKEN MUSIC PLAYING)
-What is he doing?
-Futterwacken.
(LAUGHING)
"- You'll be my slave, then."
- Are you a Traoré?
"If I had known,"
I'd have carried the two sacks on my head.
"Traoré, do you have a new slave?"
Rather he has a new master.
All right.
I'll pay you tomorrow in front of the factory.
Ok.
See you!
"Don't go yet, little slave!"
Come with me to the Bozola Co-op.
The sale is over.
Impossible!
We need rice!
There's no more left...
No more for sale.
That's the last sack.
We're out of stock.
We're out of rice.
"Balla, let's go back!"
Come!
Boss!
"Don't call me boss, call me Balla Traoré."
I wanted a leave permit.
Did you get someone to replace you?
Then tell your boss that I sent you.
"Traoré, the boss is looking for you."
I'm going to get my rice.
That's your problem.
Get to work.
You screwed up with that part.
I came all the way here to make a deal.
Jumong?
I might be in hiding but I still know what's going on.
Jumong can't leave Jolbon because of the blockade.
Why would he come here?
We have our reasons.
Daesan.
Yes?
Bring me a big jar of wine.
"Yes, sir."
Let's see if you are who you claim to be.
Drink this.
Drink up!
Tie him to that tree.
"Yes, sir."
I heard Jumong is a master archer.
Shoot that target next to him.
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up!
I don't like playing games.
"If you don't believe me, just kill me instead."
"If you're going to die anyway, shouldn't you die trying?"
I'll let you live if you hit the target.
Commander!
Shoot.
You must be Okjuh soldiers.
Kill them!
Why won't you believe us?
This is Commander Jumong!
- He is!
- Shut up!
It's the army!
- And the redhead?
- She's my associate.
You don't fancy her?
None of your business.
What about you?
No girlfriend?
It never works out with girls.
"You're good-looking, you should be popular with the girls."
I'll let you finish.
I'm off to bed.
Catch!
A T-shirt for the night.
"Good thinking, thanks."
- Good night.
Niko?
How's your hand?
That bitch bit through the skin.
You'd better get tested in case she has AIDS...
I'll call you back.
"Hello, Vlad."
How are you?
"Not so good, mate."
Why didn't you tell me a girl tried to run?
"I was going to tell you, but we got her."
Tani took care of her.
We have more pressing matters.
Did you watch the news?
Not yet...
The cops are looking for the football player.
They found his hideout.
Find him and kill him.
I don't want him to talk about us.
Run a failed restaurant?
- She probably can't even cook.
- Her vagina insult cut me to the quick... but her crumb cake was like a cloud from heaven.
Yeah.
But it is cake.
"I mean, who needs cake?"
Not exactly the pillar of a meal.
Are you implying that your fish is more important than my cake?
I'm not implying it.
I'm stating as fact.
Really?
Ever heard of a birthday fish?
No.
Dad ever take you on a caking trip?
"Oh, no, he didn't."
[ Exhales ]
Just tell Miss Lohan that I have her dog.
"No, no, no, I'm not a stalker."
I am a fan though.
I loved her in-
- Hello?
Hello?
- [ Dog Growling ]
"Snazzy, the barstool was not put there for your pleasure."
There's a Jessica on line one.
She says that she's an old friend.
"Oh, no."
Not lameJessica.
She just said Jessica.
- Hello?
- Guess who's in town.
- You?
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
OK.
- OK.
Thanks.
- I hope I get to meet him soon.
- What?
Your boyfriend.
"If you want to keep things private, you got to avoid Noreen."
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for the intel.
I was surprised to hear you were in a relationship.
I just would've assumed you'd say something.
- You're...
You're fishing.
- You're evading.
It's only fair.
You know all the details in my personal life.
"Besides, what's the big secret?"
Is he bald?
A hunchback?
A member of the Green Party?
He doesn't exist.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I lied because I...
"Well, I had to because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are..."
- They do?
- They do.
- But we're not.
- I'm aware of that.
"Every time I tried to tell Noreen, she thought I was lying..."
So you made up another lie.
You'd make a very effective politician.
This time...
You've done them justice.
Congratulations.
Take your apron upstairs.
Great job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

"Can we think about going to the doctor, please?"
Oh.
"Edwin, did you hear my grandson?"
He says I have to go to the doctor.
Is that so?
I was a doctor for 47 years.
How do I look?
"- Oh, okay by me."
Yeah.
- [Chuckling]
- Appointment done.
"- Meemaw, please."
Have something to eat.
The steaks are a buck.
I'm not hungry right now.
Why not?
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I just..."
I promised Mom that I would take you to the doctor.
That's all.
I'm trying to be a good person here.
I'm trying to be a good son.
I'll tell your mom how fabulous you are.
I'm trying to show her that I have responsibility as well.
Okay?
But you're doing something responsible.
You're-
- You're elongating my life
Because you took me to have a good time with my friends.
- Yeah.
- What could be better?
I'll have to remember that.
Trevor?
Can I ask you something?
Should my lawyer be present?
Why are you always leaving me such generous tips?
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?
And entertainment.
- Entertainment?
- You.
"Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship."
"Sorry, I..."
It wasn't meant that way.
"If you really want to spoil me, take me to a movie sometime."
That's a deal.
"My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass."
I'll get it.
- You waited on me enough.
- Thanks.
It is the last door on the left.

I want you on the Swansea-lathe today.
Where is Sanchez?
"That's an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you."
Shit!
"- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know."
"- Thank you, Mr Furman."
- Goodbye.
- See you now.
"Hey, look who it is."
"Bombay Miller, you okay?"
"- Good, good."
Maybe because of this.
"Oh, my God."
Do you think -- I do.
What are we going to do?
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Just get rid of the evidence.

"Okay, I'm no health nut, but that... is just wrong."
"All right, talk."

I'm not a killer.
"Well, then, what are you?"
I'm a Pishtaco.

A Pishtaco.
"It means ""Peruvian fat sucker""."

Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Don't hang up.
"Look, I'm so sorry about before."
I think...
"God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?"
I really need to talk to you.

Anna?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.

Why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Have you seen my keys?
"You can't wait to get back to her, can you?"
Can you just please help me find my keys?
What did I do?
"You didn't do anything, Kim."
You're amazing.
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.
Here.
Thank you.
Come on.
I wanna have a talk with you.
Doesn't that make you feel proud and dignified?
"Oh, boy."
"Hey, that's a honey of a dashboard too."
"Strictly airplane type, Mr. Taylor."
"- Yeah, airplane, huh?"

"Oh, great."

That's big time.
"That's mob, Thomas."
"Rick, I am not jumping to any conclusions."
just 'cause it looks like... just cause it looks like he is a government witness.
Whoa.

"Bullets flying' all over the place, and you got a race?"
"You really believe her, huh?"
Rick!
"Okay, okay."
"I told you I'd check it out, and, Thomas, I will check it out."
"Um, Thomas, listen."
I thought after the race I'd throw a little celebration.
Like a congratulation gesture.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just us guys.
Yeah.
And maybe a couple of TV reporters.
"You know, a human interest story."
Get a little publicity for T.C.
"You know, war buddy helps pal."
Yeah.

"And how about some wire service stringers,"
"Rick and a couple of photographers, Life Maga..."

Good.

Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."

"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
What!
?
I'm already married.
No.
You're not.
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
Yeah you said you bought a ring yourself at Woolworth's.
When times got hard he tried to send you back to Wales.
And he's disappointed in you?
He's a stupid bloody fool.
But he's not as much a fool as you.
He changed a name for Christ sake!
Where's your fucking self respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
I know you deserve better.
You?
You're the better!
Catrin I...uh...
Look I think...you must.
And I think...you're a drunk squalid bully.
Quiet!
Hush.
You are speaking of flight lieutenant Lundbeck?
Cha?
You know he didn't have any film roles under orders.
"They told me I would be good for ""Eagle Squadron"" recruitment, Sir."
He's desperate to get back in the air.
Poor boy.
Tea sir?
Just walk out from us?
He did all my homework.
Sit down.
So you did it?
I see you missed out on your education.
"""We walk""."
Walk doesn't take an 's' in the plural.
"Page 24, ""The blazing sun ripens the wheat."""

- It's in my book!
Go and sit down.
Get back to your desk!
What's wrong with your book?
Don't panic!
Get back into class!
Time's almost up!
You can go home now.
You stay here.
I'd like a word with you.
- What's wrong?
- What?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
Hanging out with that... grunge poser.
He's beneath you!
- Why do you care who I hang out with?
- He's beneath you.
Let's not get started people hanging out with people... who is beneath them.
Are you talking about my cover girl?
"My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?"
Just look at her!
Everyone else wants to sleep with her or bathe her.
- Everyone except me.
- And what is that about you?
How you can see through her?
"- Hey, man you like this music?"
"- Yeah, I think that's great choose."
"Terrific choose, man!"
Yeah!

You should go for Resin.
She's looking for you.
"- So, Resin was coming..."
"- Oh, hi!"
I assume this is finally my iced cappucino.
- Yes.
And your change.
- Thank you.
Geez!
You really sucked that puppy back.
Are you sure this was skimmed milk?
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.

I come home to find a completely different woman in my apartment.
Why did you do it?
Wait a minute!
Why do I have to EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.
"- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband."
- You could've fooled me.
And I married a woman who looked a certain way.
"- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed."
- Betrayed!
Oh!
Please!
"Gregory, c'mon!"
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?
Why did you do this to me?
Do WHAT to you?
I don't do ANYTHING to you!
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I LOOK like?
You never looked at me ANYHOW.
"Come, we're going in."
There.
"So, please come."
Come along.
Good girl!
Always keep this finger straight.
"At most like this, always away."
Why?
To avoid the trigger.
People always have their finger on it.
It goes off and someone's dead.
There was just another incident in the army.
Some guy shot another in the neck.
"""Weapon malfunction,"" it says in the paper."
Malfunction?
He had his finger there and pressed.
And it fired.
"All shooters, 99% of them."
Hunters too.
always have their finger in there.
It happens so fast.
Your finger's the no. 1 danger.
"He picks up his gun, finger in there, and it goes off."
"You take it like this, with your finger out."

And in perfect order.

Yeah.

Look.

I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
Are you really gonna show me the bingo prizes?
"Just for you, Goten."
This way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
What was that?
"Okay, let's open this up."
Right.
Whoa.
Are these all bingo prizes?
Tsk tsk tsk...
"Goten, don't go getting surprised yet."
Click.
What's this?
"Oh, Goten."
Of course it'll hurt if you just rush in and touch it.
"Whoa, that's some tough security...."
Mum's invention.
She says that nobody will find the grand prize when it's in this.
Then we won't be able to see it either...
Don't worry.
"Mum's inventions may be great, but..."
See?
They've always got some sort of flaw.
"Great job, Trunks-kun."
"Okay then, I'll show you the grand prize."
Whoa.
I'm hungry...
"It's your own fault, Pilaf-sama."
We've had nothing but grass to eat for three days.
"That's a harsh diet, even for a dog."
Yes.
Right.
"Well, you-- you should go do that."
I don't want to keep you.
- Abby.
- Yes?
What are you doing here?
And why aren't you in uniform?
"Look, I really didn't want to talk about this here."
"I was gonna tell you all last night, but then I thought I should probably tell you at Sunday dinner."
"- Abby, you're rambling."
"- No, I'm not."
Isn't that that bitch from I.A.?
"Her name is Lina Flores, and she's not a bitch."
She's my partner.
"Well, she might be a bitch."
I don't really know yet.
I just started.
- What are you talking about?
- Partner?
I made detective and took an opening in Internal Affairs.
- You what?
- Does dad know about this?
No!
And please don't say anything.
This is so typical of you.
What is that supposed to mean?
Figure it out.
He--
Abby.
Those your brothers?
Both cops.
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.
Is Lieutenant Papadol from Toronto?
Yeah.
Transferred here a few years back when he married a local.
Word of advice-- don't mention the Stanley Cup.
"Oh, park it there."
You looking for their horns and pitchforks?
No.
Yes.
Sorry.
We're checking out Roy Taggot and George Lee.
You know 'em?
No.
Good.
"Heads, you take Taggot, tails, Lee."
"Officer Taggot, Detective Kowalski."
So...
What happened last night?
- Read my report.
- I did.
"You spelled ""verbal"" wrong."
Complaint stated that you slammed a bar stool over Mr. Penn's head.
The guy was a jackass.
The guy was a jackass?
Seriously?
That-- what does that mean?
"Are you saying that's why you hit him, or are you just commenting on his personality?"
I'm trying to help you.
This isn't your first complaint.
You already have a prior for fighting.
Do you really want this on your record?
"Look, Taggot, I get it."
I do.
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."

(GROANING)
(RUMBLING)
Put down the prom baby.
(BABY WHEEZING) Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
(ECHOING) What's that?
You're broadcasting that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, I still have to... (WARNING ALARM BLARES)"
(GROANS)
Fuck!
"Henry, no!"
No!
(SCREAMS)
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me."
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
What the fuck was I thinking that Akan's toy robot was my friend?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife together, right?"
Hee hee!
You've bust it.
How fast were you going?
"In the car, it was 124. 9."
"More, and the other side will go."
No.
Ready?
That's it.
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '
I'm not quitting.
I'll have another go.
You better succeed.
One of the strangest things about being over 40 is that you start to want contestants on game shows to win.
"You also start to like game show hosts, even dressed as deck chairs."
Richard Whiteley!
APPLAUSE
Wow.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.
How much do you get for renting that out?
"Mind you, I'm not one to talk."
Let's be honest - really.
Let's do your career history.
Born up north.
Yorkshire.
Which is fine.
Educated at Cambridge.
Wooh!
Someone has to be.
You were the first person on Channel Four.
Clamp.
Clamp.
Keep steady pressure.
3-0 silks.
3-0 standing by.
More gauze.
Gauze.
- Got it open.
"- Okay, clamp it."
"Here you go, doctor."
- Keep the pressure on.
"- Yes, sir."
Let's get some more gauze in here.
"Okay, she's under."
I want you two stationed right here.
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me.
"Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask."
"If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time."
"That's my statement, as it is."
"My god, Tony."
Nina tried to commit suicide.
"She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery."
Where is she now?
She's in the clinic being operated on.
Who's with her?
"Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated."
I saw her go under.
Who's with her now?
"Tony, who's with her?"
!
Damn it!
Which way did she go?
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
Will all the competitors please assemble before the foating platform... for the dotting ofthe dragon's eye.
"It's our pleasure to welcome... the president of Tung Yuan Financial Corp., Mr. Tony Weng... the chairman of Rotary Club, Mr. Peter Chu..."
Cover him up.
Keep everything under control.
Red alert!
red alert!
Tony Weng's been shot on the foating platform.
The shot came from around the fishingjunks.
The killer is probably nearby.
All units!
Prepare to seal offthe area.
Mr. Weng fainted.
Everything's fine.
Please enjoy your day.
Chang!
"Chang, look over there!"
An explosion!
Let's check it out
"Chang, we can't lose him now!"
Freeze!
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
I have to get him.
I have to get him.
- No!
Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!
I'll drag him down to hell with drums and trumpets!
"The world can go to the dogs, every single man and woman!"
We're all going to hell with drums and trumpets!
You can't go out there!
We're all going to hell!
You're coming to the station.
You're Biberkopf!
We're all going to hell!
Don't ever come back here again!
REWARD!
MURDER IN FREIENWALDE
"Listen, wanna make some money?"
A pile of dough.
- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go and... all I could see...
was black... and all I could feel.
was the darkness above me and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then
I heard this voice.
like somebody whispering in my ear.
"""Wake up, number 37""."
"""Wake up"""
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright...
Lightning.
Something encircles me.
Don't bathe in the evening!
You could have a chest-congestion!
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.
Great woman!
She observes cleanliness even at this age!
"You bathe everyday, don't you?"
What do you mean?
"I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!"
Wow!
She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!
Jai!
What are you up to?
The water wouldn't flow the drain!
So I came down!
Jai!
What's that?
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!
It belonged to my mother.
When she died... my father asked me to preserve it carefully.
And what's that...
on your forehead?
"Eyebrows, eh?"
It's a dot!
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...
"""You have a necklace."
"Complete the picture with a dot""!"
You must wear it on your forehead.
Jai!
I'm here too!
"Talk to me, when you're through with her!"
5th Army Cameras!
Turn that... thing.
Oh my!
"General, there was a small accident but we'll go on."
Continue.
We better go now.
I'm sorry about that.
"I'm sorry, we better leave."
The ambulance is on its way.
"You can go, Jimmy."
You are the winners.
-What's the matter?
-A transfer instability.
It may be only temporary.
Something's wrong.
"Yes, you're right."
It's getting smaller.
-Can't you do something?
-I don't understand.
I don't understand.
But the Doctor's in there!
-It's your codes that are doing this.
-This is unheard of.
"-Well, how do we get him out of this?"
-A fault in the computation.
But there must be something you can do to put him right.
Take the machine to the Central Register.
What're you going to do with it?
"The Central Register, quickly."
There may still be time.
The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
"Henry, no."
I'm instructing... shit.
"Good job, Charlie Bronson."
Bravo 2-0.
Lights up.
Play video.
Dawn of Twilight... a cyborg era.
"Thank you, sir."
I've lobotomized everything not essential... not essential to soldiers.
"Personal memories, speech, sense of taste... it's all gone."
"May still have a bit of an issue with emotional motivation, which..."
Motivation?
"Try your fucking paycheck, James."
"My paych... yes, okay."
"- What the shit fuck, James?"
"- I'm sorry, sir!"
I'm so sorry!
"Oh, shit!"
Open the doors!
Please!
Open the door!
We've got a malfunction!
"Let me out, please!"
"Uh, I'll fix it."
I doubt it.
Fucking idiot.
"You know, Jimmy, something about a spine snapping... it never gets old."
- It sounds like...
"- The end, the beginning."
Or are they the same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on everyone's mind, especially his... does his dick work?"
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
"Hot, maybe?"
Very hot?
What is this?
This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.
"-Heh, and this?"
My grandmother's earmuffs.
"Heh, look at them, lieutenant."
Everybody is a clown.
How do you expect to win the war mit an army of clowns?
We sort of hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yes.
"Now, outside, everybody!"
Everybody out for the blankets!
- Clear out.
Here we go.
"-Hey, you too!"
Outside!
Get going!
"Hurry up, boys."
"Oh, that Schulz pig."
He knew where the radio was all the time.
"Whoever that stoolie is, he's sure batting 1000."
Now the guy I want to talk to is Sefton.
Has anybody seen Sefton?
"Cookie, you haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Krause, you here."
"Hoffy, I'm very sorry about the mousetrap but the war news are very depressing anyway, huh?"
I might as well also confiscate the antenna.
American know-how.
"All right, let's hear it."
It's none of your business anyway.
No.
It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia.
It's lan McKnight.
Lovely.
"I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag."
"More to the point, we're just about done with the single."
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it.
Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it.
It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.
-You hire a lawyer.
-That's how I want to finish.
"-What, with a lawsuit?"
-No.
With that song.
-Which song?
-The song I just played you.
-It's a ballad.
-So what?
-You want me to hand them a ballad?
-That's right.
- What took you so long?
- I needed a cigarette.
"Got a problem with that, little miss?"
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.
"- Oh, do you have any weed?"
"- No, can I have my mail?"
"- Hello, baby."
- Would you like to take Evie?
- Certainly not.
I can't afford to smell of vomit.
"- Yeah, I know, I remember."
- Maybe one of the other girls can take care of her.
- Is M free at the moment?
- Thank you.
- Um.
What did you do that for?
"- 'Cause it's not the first time a client's written me a love letter, Lily."
- Really?
Like what?
What kind of stuff do they write?
"Well, like what?"
"Roses are red, violets are blue,"
I pay you money and we fuck.
"- Yeah, pretty much."
"- Now then, Joey is it?"
- Yeah.
Katy.
Katy.
- I'm an employment officer here at the Elizabeth branch.
Do you know why Centrelink has called you in today?
- 'Cause it's my birthday?
"Yes, we are bending all together"
Nice
Bend a little more
"Nice, very nice"
Bend
Why is not this one working?
What kind of neck is that my girl?
You raise it like a duck
"Bend, Will you stand like this infront of Valide Sultana?"
"Bend, bend a little more."
Bend!
Nice
Is not Sümbül Ağa here?
I don't know where he is my Sultana
He's always missing
"Gül Ağa, I'll have 2 fountains built"
Find needing neighbourhoods for me
Find the locations.
Oh and I'll also have a Turkish bath built
Mşallah my Sultana.
You'll get lots of prayings
He'd tell about this to his Sultana
It would be good.
That's why I said it in public
"If not him, then someone else will dliver this message"
What are these?
Sculptures.
But what are they doing here?
Welcome
These are...
"Diana, Apollo and Hercules"
İbrahim Paşa brought them from Buda
Let me go!
You swine!
I'll give it to you right in the face!
Bastard!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
He wouldn't obey either!
So I grabbed him just like this and pushed him out of the car!
Murderer!
Help!
Help!
We wander through the whole wide world
We wander because we enjoy it so
We wander over hill and dale
We wander through the whole wide world
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Where's Mieze?
I heard her yelling.
She's not yelling anymore.
Let's go!
NO SHORT SWIM TRUNKS ALLOWED
Mieze's run away.
What can I do?
She left her clothes and everything behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Yeah.
What's she doing with a louse like me?
It was just the one time.
One time or ten ― it's the same thing.
I know who she ran off with.
- Who?
- A guy she knew before.
- talking about?
"- Your date, Audrey?"
She got a visit from your wife.
Grace cancelled her.
Grace did?
You had no idea?
Do you know how this impacts my business?
Audrey Richardson?
She's one of my most important clients.
"Well, if Grace thought it was a bad idea, then I'm fine with that."
I'll find Audrey someone else.
Rein in your wife.
"I don't put my wife in her ""place."""
This isn't the '50s.
Remember what's at stake here.
"Look around, Adriana."
We are shut down.
The SEC is up our ass.
I am well aware of what's at stake.
Wait.
This is it.
Here.
The location.
It's perfect.
Your office?
Not my office.
A 1950s office.
"A throwback to old traditions, gender roles, where a man could ""rein in his wife."""
With all the sexual role-play that implies.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
"That was inspired, Neil."
But also continuously.
Martin?
-I'd like to say something.
-Yes.
"If it goes on like this, it will come to an end."
-Yes.
-I mean yesterday.
Yes.
Why did you let that idiot be with you?
We could have had a nice evening.
-Yes.
-Who are you constantly calling?
-Are you even listening to me?
-No.
I mean yes.
You get this from the pills.
Trying it on yourself!
What do you have your guinea-pigs for?
Some things in human homes are breakable.
And some are unbreakable.
What do people use it for?
"I don't know, people are strange."
And hang up when I'm speaking with you!
"No, I can't stand it."
When will this misery end?
!
Some things can open normally.
And some can't open at all.
But they can.
We must close the opening so that something else won't fly away.
-Some things play.
-And some things don't play.
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
Better come with me.
Did everything go alright?
Not now.
"Hi, Kelly."
"My regular, Willy."
Right.
"Two more beers, Willy."
Yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
I got one.
"Hi, buddy, what'll you have?"
"This is for hers, and I'll have a cognac."
Thanks.
You just get off the boat?
"Yes, how did you know?"
It shows all over.
Where are you from?
France.
Hm... where did you learn to speak English so good?
I studied at a great school in Oxford.
Oxford...
I oughta go there.
They'd be more likely to study you there.
Are you being insulting?
"No, I just meant that you'd make a fascinating course in anatomy."
Thanks.
How come you just get off the boat and head straight for a bar?
Looking for company.
"Hm, what sort of company?"
Your sort.
How do you know what my sort is?
"Well, you're not a school teacher."
"Hey, man."
Yeah?
So Caroline tells me you've been on your own the past two weeks.
Is everything okay?
You're asking me about my mom?
Seriously?
Why don't I have her give you a call when she blows through?
Dude.
"That's not what I meant, okay?"
I'm just trying to...
- I don't know what to say.
- Good.
"Don't say anything, because you're a dick, end of story."
I know.
"Yeah, whatever."
BONNIE:
"Hey, thanks for meeting me."
- I wanted you to see this.
- Is that Emily's spell book?
I've been going through it since Grams died.
Check this out.
- That's the vampire compass.
- Yeah.
"According to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never succeeded in inventing anything."
Emily secretly spelled them all with magic.
Compass.
Rings.
The mystery device you told me about.
ELENA:
"Yeah, that's it."
"Well, part of it."
Damon only has the one piece.
Go.
Go.
- Come on!
Pick it up!
- Stop!
"I'm calling the cops, kid!"
"- Let's grab the bike, man."
"- Look, you can't tell anyone."
Okay?
No one.
It's okay.
I swear.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Hey.
"You did good, all right?"
"All right, stop crying and go to sleep."
- Jacob...
What if we really went to Galveston like Mom wanted?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Would you like to try our new Quiet Burger?
"- No, thanks, Ted."
I'll just have an order of Crazy Fries.
"- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?"
- Ham.
- Watch out.
There's enough rat poison in this dipped cone to kill a neo...
- Uh...
"I was thinking once she's dead, we could put her body in the... you know, just like on that one episode of..."
- I want some.
- You asked for ham.
- God!
Now we'll never know which episode it'll be like!
- He is no criminal!
"- So, he's starting to act like that again?"
"Not him, me!"
You darling?
Ah well.
Kiss me!
Kiss!
What a fine girl you are.
Just how I like it.
He's hanging around with scum like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself!"
- Let me go!
I can't breathe!
"- Feel free, there is plenty of air!"
You think you can just run away and ashame me in front of my friends later tonight?
"Reinhold said Kiss me, follow my order!"
Let me go!
I'll take anything I can find and throw it in your face!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
"He behaved just like you, unwilling to comply with my rules!"
So I grabbed him like this and threw him outta the car!
Killer!
Killer!
Killer!
Help!
- Go!
- What happened to you?
Where is Mieze?
Why was she screaming?
She isn't screaming anymore.
Now go!

"What kind of studies is he doing that, he has become like this?"
"Brother, there is someone whom Faiz loves."
- She does not care for him?
- No!
"I mean, she did care earlier."

Egg and cress...
Isn't life wonderful?
You looking?
I don't... what?
"Few scars, few marks..."
What do you think of them?
I think they're horrible.
"At least I got 'em, mate."
Cos I fucking wear 'em.
Right...
How about you?
Do you... have any marks?
- No.
I'm fine.
"- Oh, yeah, course you are..."
You're fine and dandy.
Right?
Egg and cress...
It's a little fucking miracle.

Chelsea has to win if they want to stay on top of the table.
Unbelievable.
I need some fresh air.
Hopeless.
Football?
I'm not going to let you die.
"22nd August, 2007."
You have two new messages.
First message.
"Neil, Ranbir here."
Call me back.
Second message.
Neil... it's been three months now.
You keep saying that you'll come here.
I guess it was naive of me to believe you.
Anyway...
I just want you to know that...
I'm pregnant.
"I'm sure, this is the last thing you needed to know."
"Neil, I've treasured every moment of my life since I met you."
"And, I'll always love you for that."
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
Neil.
Who won?
Um...
We think... we think... that you were shipwrecked.
[Imitates wind]
Oh!
And you managed to swim to shore.
"And somehow, you, um, broke your ankle."
You broke your ankle.
"Dr. Mead, um, the doctor, he thinks you need much rest."
[Speaking Polish]
[Kisses]
[Speaking Polish]
But you don't think he's German?
"- Oh, no."
- Just as well.
"[Mouth full, indecipherable]"
"- Oh, Ursula."
Please.
Sorry.
He seems to understand the language.
"- Oh, really?"
Since when did you speak German?
"Well, I..."
How is he?
"If he drinks any more tea, he's gonna need a chamber pot 'cause he ain't fit to walk to the bathroom."
You finished with this lot?
"Yes, I think so."
What's he gonna do without his clothes?
His own are ruined.
I thought perhaps some of father's might fit him.
"I doubt it, but you could try."
You want me to get the chest then?
"If you wouldn't mind, Dorcas."
Daddy.
Go crazy.
And here's a tiny little schnitzel and I'll take a tiny little bite...
"No, don't eat mine!"
I'm late for rehearsal.
"Go on, go to your rehearsal and don't do us any favors."
I know your assistant director can do the replacement.
"Sure, why not?"
Why don't we let Slava Chaplin do it?
Silkis.
Silkis.
Hello.
Are you Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant.
"Yitzhak, what's going on?"
We have a search warrant.
What are you searching for?
"Goni, go to your room."
Why?
Come in.
Check the bookshelf.
Take a look in the bedroom.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
Don't you think you're out of line?
What do you think you'll find here?
"Tell them to stop, Yitzhak."
You and your damn police have some nerve!
Ora.
There's nothing we can do.
Let them finish.
"Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you."
You made me nervous.
"You look like shit, acting all crazy."
What's up with you?
Nothing is up with me.
"It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you."
"You ain't hearing me, man."
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
"Howdy, partner."
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.
- What about?
"- I don't know, but it seemed important."
"Well, he's gonna have to wait."
It's Miller time.
We need to talk.
Follow me.
Come on!
Another Bourbon.
Make it double.
You shooting coke or something?
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.
How about abnormally?
I see Reynolds is back to work.
Gets to make bail.
-Alice has returned to Underland.
-Where is she now?
-In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me.
I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
"No, no, no, no."
But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now.
You've done well.
(SQUEAKING)
ALICE:
Have you seen a hat around here?
"You must find Alice, Stayne."
"Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me."
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
"Men, women,"
(ANIMALS GRUNTING) even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
"Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?"
Not certain anymore.
"Oh, let her have the rabble."
I don't need them.
He was stabbed many times?
Not just once?
"Hey, where is everyone?"
We got some new information.
We're all going to Im Tae Ho's house.
What?
Oh...
Put him in handcuffs immediately!
Everybody is going crazy...
Starting with President Seo.
"Hey, take those off."
"Wait, what's going on?"
Why do you need to see our car?
Please cooperate.
Please... open the door for us.
We need to do this to prove Tae Ho's innocence.
Why are you trying to prove the innocence of a person who did nothing wrong?
Three million won per week...
But Mr. President...
Where did you get this new information?
It was from an anonymous source.
Anonymous!
"- Hurry up, get in there."
Hurry.
- Yes.
Honey.
Are you okay?
Did you get any sleep?
Yes.
Once this is over...
I will get my revenge on President Seo for this.
Yoon Sang Min and Park Seon Woo... and... anyone else that is involved.
There was little p.çleri. Now the dead.
I killed them.
A few friend like that.
"Around out there, the drugs sold."
All the dirt was making them.
I was doing the right thing.
I was going great.
Cleaned the streets.
Was wrong.
No one did not work.
Drugs flowed somehow.
The bad one always remained poor.
"Everything is about money, son."
Now I'm happy to be on this side.
The money side.
So do you.
- Okay?
"I'm doing it for you, you know?"
- I understand.
I understand.
- I am very grateful for everything you did for me.
- I love you.
You are my son.
Hallederken this job if you need me call me.
I call.
But you will not need to.
"However, take care."
To fix this problem.
"- If you are going across borders and customs control of the If I had transportation, it would be OAN'de."
- Oan?
- Public Transport.
"- Tool, the other should have been hired."
"It's enough to make you scream, you know!"
People are supposed to sit here all night waiting for tickets!
Is it war or what?
"No coming, no going."
And no one to complain to.
No one to tell about it.
Such huge trains are running and they can't take just one person on.
What kind of business is that?
Parasites!
"- Hey, man, what's that you got?"
- A ticket.
- For the next train?
"- Right, it's coming."
- She said no tickets.
- This is WL.
It's expensive.
How expensive?
"Well, it's not that expensive, but it's good because..."
Oh shit!
"Make way, women!"
Can you hear me?
"Aunt Katya, take a broom and come to the buffet."
"Folks, who ties animals to the ticket office?"
"Someone tied a dog, now it's a steer."
It's no way.
"Untie him, please."
Hello.
Good day.
- Hi.
- It's occupied.
Oh God...
- I'll be right back.
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.

Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
"He had never deceived me, but for that night."
I always lost sleep and waited anxiously for his return.
"The time passed, one, two. three."
One gets preoccupied and concerned with... the thought that something might have happened.
"Telemessage, the person you called is unavailable."
FiIippo?
Is it you?
Also drunk again.
You are unable to even vomit.
Come back to say you lost all your money?
I lost everything.
Who won now?
The dull.
The blonde.
"I said to you, no more games."
"So I played once again, so what?"
Alright.
It is not the most important thing in the world.
And how much did you lose?
All of it.
I've lost totally.
Totally!
All of it.
All.
I have nothing left.
You have your wife.
"She is a beautiful woman, your wife."
-Only for one night.
"-Or pay the ten million, which you owe."
-Your wife is a precious woman.
-And very lucky.
Yes.
- Yeah.
- Jacob.
I heard you were leaving.
- Can you give me one last blessing?
- Sure.
May the force be with you.
That... that's it?
"Yeah, I'm afraid so."
"For more details, see your local priest or rabbi."
Take care.
"- So, you all good?"
"- Yeah, I'm good."
"- Good, good..."
- More or less.
"Just, um..."
"I mean, you know, crazy as it sounds, I-I miss God."
"Well, if it's of any comfort,"
I'm sure God would be thrilled at your recovery.
Really?
How do you figure?
'Cause you serve God's neediest people by making tons of money and giving it away.
- God loves charity.
- All right.
"If you wandered the world with a begging bowl, who would that help?"
- Absolutely no one.
- Nobody.
"In fact, it'd be a sin."
"So go forth, continue to do God's work."
- All right.
Golf next week.
- Done.
"So, uh, is there anybody home?"
"Well, I'll get some kind of a job and start up the old road again."
"(male #2) 'What's the assessment, my good fellow?"
'
"(male #3) One forty, sir."
"Here you are, there's five dollars."
You keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
And buy yourself a haircut with it.
"Ah, there you are, children."
"Father, where were you?"
I've been worried to death.
"Serving our noble cause, my dear."
"Here, just feast your eyes on that."
Fifteen thousand!
"Well, who's Magenta P. Schultz?"
"- Why, that..."
"- Father, how did you get it?"
When I told the Duchess the predicament we were in she insisted on helping us out.
- Insisted?
"- Yes, my dear."
Insisted.
"Ah, there's a woman for you."
Isn't it splendid?
"Come, come, my boy."
Reassemble the cast.
"Order the costumes, strike up the band."
The show will go on.
[laughing] [mumbling] Abracadabra.
Abra..
Abracadabra!
Abracadabra!
Here's your money.
"Are you sure you're okay, dude?"
"No, I'm not."
"I start thinking, you know, and it makes..."
It makes me so angry.
What am I saying?
Okay.
Were gonna go...
We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
- Yes!
- And you stay here and eat your eggs.
Have the...
Have...
Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
"- Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?"
- Can you meet us later?
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?
- Are you gonna meet us?
"- Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!"
All right.
"All right, sign here, here and here."
And what is this?
These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.
"Oh, we don't care about that."
Sign away.
"- What's the, uh, fighter's name?"
- Clown Baby.
- Clown Ba...
Clown Baby?
- Yeah.
- You mean like a baby clown?
- Not a baby clown.
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, Yo-Yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
This bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
City property.
I've damaged city property.
They said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window to magnify and shine so brightly that our pursuers'll be blinded by it."
"Come on, open the doors."
I can't see.
- Yeah.
"- Come on, let me out."
- Everybody OK?
"- Yeah, sure."
"""Our love is just a mirage."""

Bye-bye!
"Damn, Hiroshima escaped!"
Bye-bye!
I'll go to Japan to stop him!
"No need, it's only a small matter."
Small matter?
You traitor!
- What?
- l beat you.
Why did you hit me?
Why not!
The whole world's destroyed by you.
You're the sinner of all mankind.
- l'm sorry!
- Why hit her?
And me too?
Why did you give the Formula to the Japanese?
What are you laughing at?
"Don't worry, Hiroshima never got the real 'Beast'!"
Then where's the real one?
The real one's right here!
"Well done, Yoyo!"
I can see the money already.
We can go on a trip tomorrow!
Shush...someone's about!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Come out quickly!
About everyone screwing everyone.
What you read in the tabloids.
It's even worse.
- l could tell you stories.
- Tell me.
There's one bigwig when he throws a party the neighbors secure their kids behind locks this big.
Kids six or seven years of age.
"Girls, but boys too."
What do you think of that little boys?
- Hello sir.
"Hi, Herman."
- Adrienne...
Madam told me to clean up.
Won't you join us?
Funny bunny.
"Tell me more, Gerard."
Later in the car.
- Coming?
- Good morning.
- What the hell are you doing?
- For later!
You with a famous writer!
Who cares...
Bye!
"Now tell me, do these TV people go at it all the time?"
They slow down in their 80's.
Can't we flnd a quiet place in the dunes?
I'm a nature lover.
"Ah, I like touring."
"And are those showgirls an easy lay, too?"
"- You revel in such things, don't you?"
- l love sex.
Just say what you want.
You have to speak up.
How else can I understand you?
Why are you so distant suddenly?
I just want to freshen up my head a bit.
"Oh, that's it."
"Well, sir, you should do what you prefer."
"When things become clear to me, I'll call you."
It will become clear for sure.
I'll talk to you then.
"I'll express myself not with words, but with action and time."
What's the date today?
Ah!
You're here!
Have some coffee.
It's better than I'd expected.
Have some potatoes.
"Coffee, no thanks."
"Ah, yes."
I'll have some coke.
"- Okay, do you have change?"
"- Yeah, I've got some."
- Changwook!
- Be careful.
"- Shall we go, Director Kim?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
- Lovely.
What's gotten into you?
Two days later
"Help me, please."
The phone has been turned off.
"- It really makes you, like, squirm."
So good.
"- Oh, my God."
- I love Kevin Corrigan.
"Okay, Englewood."
Okay.
"Well, the last bus to Englewood left seven minutes ago."
You see?
She's fine.
Let's go.
"No, just because there was a last bus doesn't mean she was on the last bus."
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.
"- Oh, no."
Don't throw up.
"- Oh, God."
The thing that's too bad is that there were many other throw up scenes in the original and now there's...
"No, I mean, that's a good thing."
- I don't...
"- Remember, there were like...?"
- We shot four other throw-up scenes.
- On the bus.
Remember?
"With the projectile, with the tube hooked up to your face."
Yeah.
- Norah.
- Caro...
"Oh, no."
"This was like a river, a river flowing."
"Oh, God."
And it's so hard to sync it up with your mouth.
- It seemed all so unreal.
- Empty your pockets.
"- Hey, meth-head."
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.
"Do it, or I will kill you both."
"Okay, here you go."
Look.
Empty.
- Now you.
- I don't have anything.
- Do it.
- I don't have...
- Just empty your pockets.
- No.
I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna...
I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
- It's a matter of principle.
- A matter of principle?
- I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
"- I'm gonna stab you, man!"
"- For the love of God, empty your pockets."
- Okay.
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.
You give us a second.
Where did you get that money?
I had to change the bet... a little.
- You bet against me?
- I bet against you.
- Why would you bet against me?
- It was the right move.
- But you fuck like one.
- Chill.
- Did you hear what he said?
Jonas has got a 5 million dollar trust fund.
- Money's not everything.
- It is tonight.
Tommy?
...
Tommy?
- I made a couple of bad investments.
- So we've no more money?
- I took some chances.
- What about this summer?
- I sold the beach house.
- We just asked our friends to come.
- Cancel them.
- We'll be a joke.
The bank wants its money.
Nobody will lend me any.
- Come on.
- We'll never forgive you for this.
- I need your credit cards.
- What will we live on?
You'll have to stop shopping.
He's so way out of line.

"Where have the 40,000 euros come from?"
What are you insinuating?
"I don't know. 40,000 euros were deposited in this account, the firm's account, and they disappeared."
I'm wondering.
This money was sealed.
My client needed to get it back in cash.
I helped him.
That's all.
Why make it go through the firm's account?
You couldn't deposit it in his account directly?
He doesn't have an account.
His banking privilege is suspended.
You don't believe me?
Call him.
"Go ahead, call him!"
You wouldn't take the risk of lying to me.
"I give you my word, all right?"
Arnaud Ledoré?
Hello.
How are you?
Hello.

Can we talk to you for two minutes?
Yes.
What about?
It's about Julie.
Julie.
That's enough.
- Who filmed that?
Heck no!
"Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions."
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Boss, she's a woman in a million."
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She don't talk.
Oh!
"All right, get on with the dogs."
"No, thank you."
I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

Say!
"Nice, modest little prices they have here."
They practically give things away.
"Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?"
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do.
Come on.
"- Come on, Buck."
"- Come on, Buck."
"Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye."
There's an officer of the Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
"We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds."
"Yeah, yeah."
What?
What's real is the cop we have tied up in the basement.
"When Marius calls, we can let him go."
The cop does not care about us.
- I swear to God...
- How do you know that?
It seems to me... we let him go.
"Best case... prison, my business destroyed, and Family Services takes Amanda."
- No.
- I won't let that happen.
[phone buzzes]
"[buzzing] [door closes, lock latches]"
- Hey.
"- Hey, Pete."
I'm just going out.
Where to?
"I was gonna go, uh, go see my friend..."
"- you know, the married one."
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I thought..."
I thought maybe... you were going out to slash another one of my tires.
Huh?
The liquor store across the street... they have a security camera.
I saw you.
Why?
- [gulp]
"- Fucking why, huh?"
Why?
"Don't you fucking say that it was about this trunk thing because I already apologized to you for that, okay?"
[breathing heavily]
Porta-Potty.
What?
Philip.
I hope that wasn't too bad.
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.
"Oh, hey."
How's it going?
Mmh... good.
We met before.
Er...
I don't think we have.
You sure about that?
Um...
I wanted to tell you I really liked your book.
"Those advance copies really get around, huh?"
"Anyway, the first one's better."
"Um, I haven't read it."
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.
"No, if you were a groupie, you likely would have read both my books."
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?
"Not many, but yeah."
Hey!
(WHISTLES) Quick thought I just had.
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
"Readings, interviews."
Nothing.
- You cannot be serious.
"- Oh, quite."
"That's a horrible, horrible idea."
I don't like the idea of being on display.
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
You accuse me of stealing them!
?
I didn't say that!
"Do you mean me, then!"
?
"I didn't say that, either!"
"I'll fix you, if you call me a thief!"
"I won't let you off, either!"
What are you doing?
Beat you for calling us thieves!
Don't run!
Stop!
You again!
?
"Fate brings us together, from however far I bet your 109,200 miles are right here!"
Right beside your Nanking's 18 mounds!
Oh no-here comes Mr. Ugly!
A basket of grapes isn't worth this!
Two heads think better than one
Let's talk this thing over!
"Yes, we walk on two legs"
We can't let a quadruped best us!
The loser will lead the dog away
Tiger!
Snake!
Dragon!
Mantis!
Crane!
My crane will eat your mantis!
"If a man's unlucky, he'll see ghosts in the sun?"
Pick a little more!
Can I ask your name!
What task?
"Come to Wu Yen Road,"
You'll see a black car 9413.
On Friday thirteenth?
Just get into the car and I'll tell you what to do.
"Remember: better come early than late, late than never."
Right way!
"Not now, tonight!"
Tonight?
Then what shall I do now?
I even sent my secretary away!
Find something to do to kill time.
I haven't taken my milk yet.
Nuisance really!
Taxi...!
Shut up!
What the hell are you yelling about?
Damn you!
Shit!
"You think this is a night market, shut up!"
"Get lost, or I'll call the police."
Damn you!
"- Hi, Hitler!"
"- Hurry up, go!"
Go to the front!
Don't turn around!
There's match inside the drawer.
"Listen, a Jew has taken a ""Beast"" to H.K. from Europe."
To be handed to an American.
Your task is to help him find the American.
What does he look like?
The Jew will tell you.
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you
"Oh, no thank you."
- Would you like some?
- No.
"Are you sure, it's very good!"
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Gate away from me!
Ronon!
It's alright.
It's OK.
"They hate me, don't they father?"
No...
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not gonna change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, Colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
"Yes, why?"
I just found another victim.
"Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
Looks as though Zaddik may have been telling the truth after all.
We must defend ourselves!
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
My father gave us that.
This is yours.
Remember this?
"Oh, no."
Can we just do this without any theatrics?
Please.
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?
"You know, with the boys."
Some kind ofthing so they don't forget we were once-
What are you doing?
Richard?
Leave them alone.
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.
"Objectively speaking, if you weren't my children... would you think, that guy looks okay?"
He looks like a guy who might have a wife and kids and stuff?
- Are you mad at us?
"- Yeah, totally."
I think you look good.
"Okay, good."
"Space, space, dash."
Is that a Bengal tiger?
I don't know.
"Space, space, space."
Dash.
"And in the dark of the night, and it does get dark... when I call a name-"
When I call a name.
It'll be your name.
What's your name?
Nevermind.
Let's go.
And you went to I.A.?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you crazy?
Apparently.
I'll take the lead on this.
You jump in if you have a question.
Joe Penn?
Yeah.
We need to talk to you about the complaint you filed.
I already told you guys everything last night.
We're with Internal Affairs.
We conduct our own investigation.
I'm kinda busy.
You wanna retract your statement?
Then tell us what happened.
"I'm drinking a beer, talking to my buds."
"Out of nowhere, this dickmo flies--"
- Which dickmo would that be?
- The big ugly one.
Taggot?
He starts going off on Val.
- Who's Val?
- The bartender.
Taggot was drunk.
How do you know?
- You could tell.
- But how?
Were you sitting next to him?
"Did you buy his drinks, count how many he had?"
"Was he slurring his words, stumbling--"
Why would you assume officer Taggot was drunk?
'Cause Val was trying to cut him off.
There's nothing edible in here.
"So, do you want..."
Where's Angela?
She left early.
"She must of had her reasons, or whatever."
"Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital..."
- or do you just want to go to school?
"- Well, I... lt's whatever you want, sweetie."
Your mom says that it's up to you.
I guess...
I guess school.
"You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?"
And you've got the estimates?
Right?
I got them.
Yes.
Hey?
"Who's in there, what happened?"
Nothing happened.
I'm fine.
- Stop looking at me.
- Stop looking at me.
What are you doing here anyway?
- You are playing this all wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Please.
"Your dad's seriously sick, right?"
You shouldn't even be here.
"People are feeling sorry for you, right?"
- Use it.
Take advantage.
"- You're saying... I'm saying, you have a personal tragedy with a loved one."
I can understand why people would want to pay to see her.
"Well, Julia, surely not."
(Julia):
"What are we doing but watching her, William?"
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?
- Five cents.
- Ten.
"A nickel, final offer!"
What do you know?
- I seen him.
- Did you now?
- He went to see that beast in the cage.
- What of it?
I took him there.
Near the river.
- (birds singing) - ♪♪♪
What?
!
It was right here two days ago!
"Yes, I'm sure it was."
"Give us that nickel back, you little thief!"
The tent was right here!
Honest!
I swear it's the truth!
Here.
"You stay out of trouble, alright?"
"So, the victim was definitely attacked here at Travis's campsite."
Which the lying sod failed to tell us he moved.
Bloody Irish tinkers!
Nothing but trouble when they show up in their caravans.
Ten to one that that knife's the murder weapon.
"And one and two and three, twist."
"A one, two, three."
"Onto the floor, class."
Down you go.
Onto your elbows.
Single leg lift.
Right leg first.
Left leg bent.
Here we go.
And up.
Down.
Up.
Two more.
Get ready to change.
Left leg.
Hold those tummies in.
Enid!
Single leg lift!
"Oh, sorry."
"So, Tubby."
Is he very sad?
What?
What did he look like when you saw him?
He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.
"For frig's sake, Enid, if there's any havoc caused, you've caused it."
Dithering and faffing about.
You never sort anything out!
"And everyone's favourite, the bicycle."
"Summer will come, let's get ready for those bikinis!"

"Say, would your hotel give us a discount on our wedding?"
What's the point?
You'll dump me once you make it big anyway.
Not when we've invested 1.4 million yen in you.
KABUKICHO LOVE HOTEL
"Hey, stop for a sec."
Hello?
I'm leaving.
"Yes, I'll rehearse first, then head to the venue early."
After the show?
Okay.
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, sir."
"Room 302, door is open."
"Room 302, occupied."
Streetwalkers often stand outside.
"If they enter, ask them to leave."
Anything else?
The whole second floor is rented to a porn shoot from 11 AM.
"No need to clean that floor, then."
"Well, until 5 PM."
"Say, Manager, we're almost out of 100 yen coins."
"Oh, hell."
Borrow some from Atlas 2.
"Sato, go there later."
I caught a cold.
"And without insurance, I can't see a doctor."
"Fine, I'll go."
Sorry for the trouble.
I can't lose this time!
"Mrs. Brendan, I believe I can explain."
"You see, Willy, here, had a tummy ache last night."
"There was no place for him to sleep, so I invited him to stay in my drawing room."
"Well, I..."
I think that was highly commendable.
I apologize if I have violated any rules.
"Well, under these circumstances..."
Meeting's adjourned.
That's right.
"I'm sorry, Nancy."
"Well, I..."
I better be going.
"Now, it would be a shame to lose such an adorable little boy so soon."
Why don't you stay for the Saturday night party?
I'm sure you'd enjoy meeting all the little girls.
"No, I think I'd better be running along."
Good.
"Thank you, Aunt Nancy."
"Goodbye, everybody."
ALL:
Goodbye.
Bye!
Hello.
(STUTTERING)
(SCREAMING)
(BOB GROANING)
"Surprise, I'm back."
I thought you were leavin'.
"Oh, I decided to stay for the party."
How nice.
"Well, I have a class."
"I'll see you later, Willy."
- Yachting.
"- Ah, good shite."
Would you look at that fucking eejit?
Can you not just say eejit?
That's what I did say.
Where are you going?
- Toilet.
"- Jesus, again?"
Me uterus is pressing into me bladder.
"Ah, now stop that, Sharon!"
I don't want to hear that sort of thing!
It's not right.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Where's the remote?
Da?
"No, you can't have a bike."
"It's not his birthday for ages yet, is it?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"There's nothing on the telly tonight, is there?"
There's never anything on.
"Oh, you're right, of course... but there's absolutely nothing on tonight, is there?"
I suppose a ride is out of the question?
Hang on till I get this line done.
You serious?
I suppose so.
Fucking great.
You're not messing now?
No.
Just let me finish the next line.
I'll go up and brush me teeth.
That'll be nice.
Great!
You do know Bernie's doesn't allow dogs?
I panicked.
"The only thing I could think of was, ""Sorry,"
"""we'll be locked in the cellar turning into wolves."""
You should probably work on your excuses.
I can't just make up lies on the spot.
Why is my experiment a different colour to everyone else's?
"Probably, because you're right and everyone else is wrong."
"Listen, Maddy was just saying how she can't make it tonight."
Why?
Because...
I just remembered...
I have to stay in and... help Mam with...curtains.
- Curtains?
- Yeah.
She's really into crafts all of a sudden.
I said I'd hold them while she...sews.
- Can't she do it another time?
- She's got a deadline.
Sorry.
Oh.
OK.
See?
You can do it.
Finally.
- We're early.
- Just.
We came straight from school.
It just seemed to take longer.
I know.
"Too much to see, too much to smell."
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Together!
Yeah!
"-Yeah, that's the most, yeah."
-The Nike shop?
Louis...
-...shall we go in here?
"-Zayn, shall we go in here?"
"-Oh, my God!"
-Think a few fans have just spotted us.
probably tweeted.
"relax, everybody."
Come on.
will you all calm down now?
There you have it.
This is what happens.
Step back.
"Step back, please."
One Direction!
One Direction!
One Direction!
"We don't come out that often so we don't really see, Iike, this sort of side of it that often."
"So when we do, it's all a bit strange."
-I Iove you!
-Some girl was just trying to literally grab my ear.
"I think she wanted to keep it, but I was like:"
"""That's mine, love, you can't have that, unfortunately."
"It's connected."""
"Let's go, go, go."
Where'd the glasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.
I put them on.
These are sick.
They were sent to the shooter.
We traced the I.P. address.
Comes straight from this office.
(sighs)
O-Only I couldn't have sent these.
See the date and the time?
I wasn't here;
I was with a client at a hotel on Kalakaua.
I can prove it.
"Okay, Abby, who else has got access to your computer?"
Just my assistant Andrew.
He's taking off.
Hey.
Hey!
(siren wailing nearby)
(truck horn blaring)
(tires screech)
You should've let me die.
"Andrew, why would you do this?"
"I'm in love with you, Abby."
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to stop.
Unrequited love.
Second oldest motive there is.
(alarm system chimes)
(exhales)
"Hello, Sam."
"Geez, Joe."
When'd you get back?
"You know me, I come and go as I please."
"Family is safe and sound, fast asleep."
"Well, can I assume you didn't break into my home just to say hello?"
No!
Stop!
There's been an accident!
Please help me!
"Oh, God!"
Thank you.
How are you today?
Fine.
Have you ever been in San Francisco?
Yeah.
In Buffalo?
"Who are you, mister?"
You know who I am.
You did time in Buffalo.
"In Wichita, armed robbery, reduced to attempted assault."
-Could we talk about this another day?
-St.
Louis you held up a card game.
"Moline, Illinois, 13 months."
Assault on a railroad investigator.
They gave me something.
If you plead innocent and make me try you for homicide I'm going to see that you pay.
What're you sayin'?
This have something to do with this accident?
-I wasn't even driving.
"-Oh, you weren't even driving."
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.
"You have a witness at the filling station, yes."
Who do you think you're dealing with?
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.
Enjoying yourself?
Don't be stupid.
This is work.
So flirting with girls is part of your job?
Seeing you grinning makes me want to puke.
Are you getting jealous?
You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
Yeah we're good we're just here working on our calves.
Hey Drew.
- Hey hi...
Who was that?
Oh I know... that's a...
That's a client Jill!
Got back off!
Yeah right that's what it is!
Every single...
Jill called her engagement a match made in heaven.
Watching them squabble about wedding cakes and the medicinal benefits of anal sex
I couldn't help but think that Heaven has a strange sense of humor.
I'll call you later OK.
Ok.
- Ok.
Come on Bowie.
Bowie?
Terrible name.
Listen I want to try it...
Its just one little...
We can't even go hiking...
Just one time.
No!
You know that camera looks very good on you.
Aww you think?
So what are you going to do with these pictures?
I don't know.
Maybe sell them on the internet.
Make some money off your ass.
Album cover my man.
I'm telling you.
Want some?
You okay?
Can I get you anything?
"[Screaming] Oh, stop!"
"Pick your head up again, and I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
Stay right there.
Okay.
[Engine starting]
[Tires screeching]
[Cheering] Woo!
"All right, all right, all right!"
Good to see our fuckin' guy back.
You scared the shit out of him!
- I can't take these guys.
- And what'd we get?
I can drive this fucking car better than you can.
"What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man?"
"What, what, what?"
Twenties and thirties.
"Oh, hey, I got it."
I got eleven.
"Hey, man, how much money we get?"
Nothin'.
We didn't get anything!
"Sam, you in there?"
You better give me my fucking share.
- Bullshit.
- There's tomorrow.
"Yeah, there's always tomorrow."
There's always tomorrow.
"You pissed, you pissed, and this goes."
It goes.
"Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this!"
- What am I missing?
"- Perspective, for one."
That's a loss and a win.
How is that the downfall of my gym?
You worried?
No.
[Chuckles] Come on.
"Alvey, you got to be a little concerned."
Not a bit.
And this isn't an interview.
"Well, I appreciate the apology, but it's not necessary."
"You know what, you haven't seen my gym, right?"
Let me give you the 10-cent tour.
"This way, the next time you butcher me, you know what the fuck you're talking about."
- Mind if I take some photos?
"- Whatever you need, Mario."
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Lisa's looking for you.
She's in her office.
All right.
I'll be right there.
What's up?
Shut the door.
I saw you training with Alvey today.
"Oh, man, I fucking sucked."
I was so nervous.
He was impressed.
He made it a point to tell me that.
- No shit.
- No shit.
"Well, of course it's legal."
Man:
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

- [Men shout indistinctly] - 13!
- 12!
- 10!
- [Gavel banging] - 7!
Why even even put a number on it?
Because the federal elitists are suggesting 18.
- [Men shout indistinctly]
- No!
It's our choice!
- That's why I am proposing 16.
- No!
It's too old!
They call it lucky 7 for a reason!

"Well, y'all oughta get some perspective."
"Why, in Uzbekistan, girls get married at the first hint of a menstrual cycle."
Ew!
"[Lowered voice] If he comes at you, punch to the throat, swift kick to the balls, okay?"
- This doesn't feel right.
- But it is right.
Your ex-wife... she haunts you.
Even she thinks this is wrong.
"I'm afraid not, m'lady."
Put your helmet on.
"Oh, that's splendid."
(* The Wedding March)
- Get on with it.
- What shall I say?
Make it up.
(Clears throat)
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together... to marry that parrot... to that parrot."
- Amen.
- Amen.
"Hear, hear."
Go on.
"Now, if there is anyone here, who knows of any just cause or impediment why these two parrots should not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace."
Amen.
Aagh.
What's next?
What's next?
Who givethetheth?
- What?
- Who givethetheth?
Who giveth this parrot?
I do.
Where's the ring?
What are you talking about?
You're as potty as she is.
(Clears throat) I now pronounce you Parrot and Mrs Parrot.
"Those that I have joined together, let no parrot put asunder."
"Oh, it's so beautiful."
I always cry at weddings.
Is that all?
The best man may now kiss the bride.
I haven't stepped out
What about your apprentice?
If we're that skillful... we'd have rebelled long ago!
Get out!
"Okay, okay."
"Master, I'll take you to bed"
"Big Brother, Fan's death is questionable"
Do you think it's the old fart that did this?
That's not possible
The old fool does not have that ability!
It must be someone from the outside!
Who could it be?
The killer is in the temple
I am waiting for you
Very good!
Very good!
It's better than a stage performance!
Relax
You are too slow
Watch out!
Look clearly
"So it's you, you short-lived asshole!"
Don't be so mean!
Don't you want to know who killed Fan San?
Who is he?
Watch carefully!
I am the killer
Why did you kill him?
Because Jin Tianyun is my friend
Jin Tianyun!
How nasty!
I'm still a virgin!
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan B.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do one very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
(distorted) Lydia!
a project by @olivethewenno enjoy watching
"Is that you, Ines?"
I said...
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!
It doesn't hurt?
It won't hurt me?
"Oh God, my dear!"
Who did it?
What happened?
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.
Even for you.
Do you think he will forgive me?
He will.
But I won't.
Is it time to get him?
For me?
What do you mean?
"A week with you, in 10 years of our marriage!"
- Anais...
- That's all I get.
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
"Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?"
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know people.
Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why?
We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
(LAUGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
-Will this take me home?
-If that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
"A crazy, mad, wonderful idea."
But I can't.
"There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do."
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will.
How could I forget?
"Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?"
I haven't the slightest idea.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
She left me standing there without an answer.
"A case of nerves, no doubt."
-Alice.
-LORD ASCOT:
Good Lord.
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
"I'm sorry, Hamish."
I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.
If you're just going to give it away...
"If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike."
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I like to report a hit-and-run.
I'm still gonna need to record your statement.
"Later, right now I just want to..."
Just want to sleep.
Who are you?
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
No!
Trevor?
You still got a half-hour.
I could fix you some eggs.
I'm tired.
But thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on, guys."
Keep it moving.
"Yessuh, Mistah Tucker!"
Mutha-Fucker.
Why's this machine down?
Maintenance.
Takes seven minutes to power-up that mill.
"Where am I gonna make up that seven minutes, Miller?"
- From your paycheck?
"- Back off, Tucker."
You know it's against regulations.
- See?
- Oh...
That's... clap!
"One, two, three, four, five battle."
Alright tardy cake!
"- No, you're first!"
- You are... no.
You do this and...
Hey!
Look who's here?
We just saw your stupid little girl friend.
Had to tell about herself.
You should see her face.
Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns.
"Yea, we took our time doin' it too."
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together.
Even when things are getting up before them.
Step aside jail-bait!
Or don't!
If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you.
"Do it, do what they say, Daisy."
Can I ask you fellas something?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
Excuse me?
Please.
- Everybody!
- Please.
Very good!
But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware!
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.
"Hi, Riley."
ASHLEY:
I think the tie is a bit much.
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.
Then maybe lose the jacket.
"You know, it's 80 degrees out."
It looks like you don't own a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.
"I don't know, I think it looks nice."
Yeah.
"Nice, just kind of sweaty."
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.
"- OK, bye."
- Bye.
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.
- Huh?
- Your collar.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'd seriously consider having a better answer to that question if I were you.
"I'm filling up notebooks, but it's nothing but worthless garbage."
Don't tell people that.
Makes you look lazy and stupid.
Got it.
That probably came out a lot crueller than I intended.
But don't make being lackadaisical and disorganised your thing.
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.
He did not come.
Would he be it?
Major lord!
Major lord!
Please!
We are us here.
The Tót family.
The kind Tót family.
Oh finally.
"Tót lord,right?"
Mariska.
And she:
Ági.
"We welcome it with affection the kind major lord and we desire it, feel well in our modest home."
Very kind.
"Says Tót,it is not possible to silence this uproar?"
!
Stop it!
Yeah.
This is the good air.
This silence.
Believe it.
In constant noises and smelliness of 9 monthly a service working...
- What did I talk about?
- That in constant noise and smelliness...
That's right.
I cannot believe in the fact that I am at home
I know everything as your kind son wrote the things though.
"That Bábony... this the valley of Bartalapos kind Tót, we behind my back?"
Only Klein beer garden and the parsonage
Good.
"I ask it from you, live so, as if I would not be here."
Because they're more...
There are not so many cliques and...
- Why are you telling me?
- Would you like a glass of water?
"Helene, come here."
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we have to decide.
"You don't need me any more, Helene."
"Everything is taken care of now, right?"
Anna and the boys...
I'll just slow you all down.
- Stop.
- No.
I'm the only one stopping for now.
I just mean...
Do you think you and Jacob will get together?
Do you?
Stop it.
I would like to know.
I just didn't want you to see me...
like this.
"This is only the beginning, Helene."
It will get worse from now on.
- Can you manage?
- Yes.
I'm so damned pathetic...
I don't want to...
I don't want to die!
"I don't, Helene."
"I don't want to, damn it!"
I don't want to die!
I don't!
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
"Oh, wow..."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"Oh, man."
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume!
Oops.
Heh heh!
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes!
Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
"Oh, I help women, too."
You call me if he needs anything.
60cc's of gastrografin and check the K.U.B.
What's this?
Nursing home dump.
I'm changing G-tubes on comatose patients now.
- How's your M.I.?
- Unstable angina.
"Just out of curiosity, what type of guy hires a satisfaction facilitator?"
I believe it's the...
politically correct term
"- for ""call girl"" these days."
- A smart one?
We have a saying in Croatia.
"- You know, ""If it floats, flies or..."""
- Fornicates?
Rent it.
"- Hey, Dr. Kovac."
- Hello.
I thought I might take you up on that offer for some coffee.
- If you got a minute?
- Sure.
Page me if you need me.
How many stitches?
"7 on the forehead, 5 on the cheek, 12 all together."
That's not so bad.
"Neela, this is Brad, Judy's husband."
"Hey, baby."
"- Honey, I'm so sorry."
"- Oh, come on."
It wasn't your fault.
The police told me what happened.
We've already begun to evacuate the plant.
"Tony's here, all right."
Get me down.
"Thank you, thank you."
"Now, where are you going?"
In there.
"Oh, no."
You can't go beyond this point without IDs.
Tony!
- Tia!
- I knew it.
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.
We cannot let her take it away from us.
Tony!
"Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia."
She cannot break through my power of control.
- Acknowledge.
"- Tony, what's wrong?"
"It's me, your sister."
Try to remember me.
Acknowledge.
Tony?
"- Yes, sir."
- Get those kids.
She'll use some of those molecules on us.
"I'll take care of her before she gets a chance, you get them."
I can't get through.
I don't know what they've done to his mind.
We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves.
How do you spell cooling?
Come on.
He never went anywhere without it.
It's missing.
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Phone ringing]
Man:
"Hey, Duval."
[Sighs]
_
[Cellphone rings]
[Sighs]
What?
James:
Question.
Remember that promise you made to Kevin Whitfield's parents?
You want to make good on it?
What do you know about Kevin Whitfield?
Just what you told me back then.
I've been going over it.
"You know, uh, the backpack that was missing."
You thought it was connected to the killing.
Are you reading my notes?
"I, uh, I took a picture of it, and I sent it to my friends."
They did some kind of search.
"You know, like the dents and scratches on the backpack make it like a fingerprint?"
Did you know that?
[Beeping]
They looked at 5 million pictures and finally came up with the perfect match.
"One double-bacon BLT sandwich, nice and hot."
Thank you.
Duval:
Where are you?
Are you at my house?
- Totally you.
"Hey, guys, check it out."
"The deluxe limited edition ""Wild West and Witches"""
expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector's tin.
LEONARD:
"Come on, no!"
We just bought the regular pack.
"Ooh, a sheriff's badge."
(chuckles)
"Yeah, it's also a wand."
With a hologram?
Nice!
"Hey, do you see this?"
"I'm in the matrix, Leonard;"
I see everything.
You got to be kidding me.
You friended Stuart on Facebook?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
Don't be silly.
I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please.
You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Really?
"You think I care if a man, what,"
"""shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady""?"
You're so full of it.
You are free to believe whatever you like.
And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
You unfriended me?
Seriously?
"Oh, yeah."
"What are you thinking, Walter?"
"Hey, guys."
The footage from the abduction has been downloaded.
"Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum..."
- ...with some kind of weird writing in it.
- They think it was his?
"Well, they don't know, but Agent Broyles is sending it over."
OLIVIA:
Have we ID'd the victim?
ASTRID:
"No, not yet."
OLIVIA:
"Wait a minute, Astrid."
Can you zoom it?
Now freeze it.
"Peter, that isn't him."
That's a different guy.
There's more than one Observer.
Stop.
Hold on.
What just happened right there?
Was he hit?
Who are these people?
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- You don't have to do this to me.
Let me give you your coat.
That's all right.
It's OK.
Thanks a lot.
Ralphie.
"Hello, boy."
How you been?
What a good boy.
Can I buy you breakfast?
I know this great little diner.
Sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Well, seeing as you caught the killer..."
I figured the least I could do... was write you some lyrics.
So...
There once was a dick from The Windy City
"Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty"
He told her goodbye...
But he had no reason why...
That's all I got so far.
"Well, I was soaked to the marrow"
I was chilled to the heart
I took shelter in her room
She called me from the corner
Of a song I never liked
For the occasion that was in there
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
You call me a bear?
!
Relax...
See that he doesn't move.
Sit down there!
"What's up, sir?"
Do you know him?
Who is he?
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.
"Of course, I will!"
He's Laxmi's husband.
Her husband?
!
No!
I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!
He says his name is Banwari.
And you said her husband's name was Durgaprasad!
"Have I told you that, too?"
Are there two husbands then?
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.
Laxmi fondly addresses Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
"He's down, he's bleeding, and you gotta get there."
"But there's lights, right?"
"All over the city, red lights."
You go through the red lights.
"Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail, you go through the red lights."
- Passports.
I left my jacket.
What did you say about passports?
- I had the jacket when I was at the table.
Did you leave passports there?
"I'm sorry, sire."
We left the passports.
- Thing?
"Christ, you will know now that we have lied."
You've been drinking all night.
- We have to get out of this way
And leave the Balkans.
Believe me when I say
"That it is best not to make him piss, that guy."
I can assure you that there will be heels.
"So, are we now pursued by a crazy Turkish and a crazy Serbian?"
The quickest way to go is to cross the sea to Italy.
But there is another border.
Montenegro.
Let's go.
I drive.
Sire?
Ludovic?
I am very ashamed.
I know.
I have to resign.
"No, Ludovic."
"He served me well, I count on her."
I failed completely.
"No, nothing at all."
Sire.
Here is the frontier.
I really don't know how much longer
I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, all right?"
We're just trying to blend in.
Mus SCOFFS)
I'm trying to blend in.
It's just not working.
PETER:
Comin' through on your right.
"Okay, here we go."
"Hey, look, a rainbow."
- Oh.
-it's pretty.
WOMAN:
Go with happiness.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioned passivism?
I love this place.
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey, Tris, I really like your hair, by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that?
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down, huh?"
Or what?
"Besides, I think we should all stick together now that we're"
-all officially fugitives.
-TRIS:
Shh.
"Wait, what do you mean, ""officially fugitives""?"
"- Oh, you don't know?"
"-Let's go, let's go."
You didn't tell Caleb?
You know what I like about rich kids?
"Bam, nothing."
"Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider me rich, would you?"
I'd be more upper middle class?
"What's up, fool?"
"You know, you didn't have to hit him."
Sorry.
"You know, the cashier called the cops."
"Look, I don't know why Luke does that."
Did that.
He's just...
An ass?
Protective.
God.
It's my mom.
And... your dad.
It's been awhile.
Figure out what kind of shape this place is in.
Wow.
Oh.
That's what...those contractors have been doing.
This place is fantastic!
You think so?
You don't think it's too much?
Too much?
You're talking to the guy whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco.
This is gorgeous.
The high ceilings and the molding.
It reminds me of...
Your parent's house.
On Elm Grove.
"Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams."
Hallucination brought on by over-tiredness say what?
"Do not ""say what"" me."
I invented that.
Oh please that was so me.
Do you really want to have this argument?
No.
'Cause I know it was me.
Now my friends are not gonna hate me.
So just poof right back in my head where you belong.
They're gonna hate you they're gonna hate you.
-Oh real mature.
-Oh real mature.
[Both muttering]
[Mimicking Miley]
I cannot believe I'm having this argument with myself.
[Groans]
Let me ask you something son.
You ever thought about medical school?
Law school?
Any school?
[Clicks tongue]
Of course not.
Sorry I took so long.
Sometimes it takes a while to shake off Hannah.
It's cool.
No worries.
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"
Your stupid secret always comes first.
-What?
-I said no worries.
You ready to go?
"Yeah, right."
"Come, let's sleep."
"No, I'll not come."
"Come Prakash, it'll be warm."
"You mean, are you that type?"
Yuck!
Our 'friendship' is broken.
Oh broken!
"What type are you, man?"
My patient likes to undress himself and I like to undress others.
Don't you wear brief?
Door is locked!
How come I got stuck here?
"Prakash, come."
Your cheeks are like sausages.
Bommali!
I'll not leave you.
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me!
Mother!
Did you show him stars?
"I didn't show him anything, in fact he showed me everything."
They are not ordinary people.
What happened?
Asking me what had happened?
One sleeps without any clothes and another doesn't like others wearing clothes.
"I beg you dear, please shift me from that room."
- Why?
They are other 'type' of people.
Yuck!
What the hell are you saying?
"Stay with them for a night, you'll know it."
He's a sex maniac!
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
You see this button?
She controls her own dosage.
"Friends, family, career, future..."
None of these things matter to her now.
This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction.
Satisfied?
$25 million.
$30 million. $35 million.
"Ladies, you're off my grid."
I've lost visual of you.
You were right.
It is a cabal of evil florists.
We found Finch's flower patch.
If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse...
We can wipe out every damn flower in here.
Go get Amanda.
I got this covered.
Got it.
"Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead."
I'll lead you in.
Something's wrong.
I'm losing power.
Who the hell are you?
No sign of Amanda.
Abby?
Eve?
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around!
The last offer I heard was $35 million.
Who wants to get real?
$50 million.
I certainly didn't lay a hand on her.
Ok.
Sorry.
Ok.
Step together.
*** together.
"Right, left, and turn!"
And pose.
I know what you're doing.
What?
Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?
Listening to a little live music?
"Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't..."
Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?
- Great show.
- You were awesome!
"It was amazing, really."
But we have to go.
We do?
We do.
"Good job, man."
- What'd you think?
- It was really good.
"Come on, you're a musician."
You actually know what you're talking about.
- Bring it.
- Uh... ok.
"Um, your energy was really good."
"The songs are good, but, um, I don't know."
"I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess."
I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.
You guys used to play together?
- Hide me.
- What?
How?
Rick Castle.
"Oh, hi, Courtney."
Hey.
I'm Courtney.
Hayley.
"So, what's going on?"
You guys have a beef or something?
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.
No.
No way.
We're buds.
- Oh.
- Buds?
"Last time I saw you, you tried to run me down with a golf cart 'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie."
"But what I didn't know then, which I do now, was that your movie was gonna be quite possibly the worst movie ever made."
Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have happened to my career.
[Sighs]
So thanks.
Let's do lunch some time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
Say hi to Brandon.
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?
"Yeah, I can believe her."
It was a terrible film.
"Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive."
What the hell was his name?
"Look, since we're not gonna partner..."
... thatclearstheway for us to get together socially.
"You really don't get this, do you, Roy?"
Listen to what I'm saying.
I don't wanna have anything to do with you.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Hey, Laura."
-Hey.
KELLY:
Hey.
"-Hey, John."
-How's it going?
-Good.
Could you do me a favor?
-Sure.
-On the Garcia homicide...
... couldyougetstatements on the husband and wife?
-l thought I put three in there.
-You did.
You got three documents of spousal abuse.
A woman confesses...
... shestabbedherhusbandafter he beat her.
Why more statements?
Something isn't right.
Her lawyer's ready to plead manslaughter two.
That's the worst she'd do.
Something's missing.
I don't agree.
"Before the trial, I'll reinterview like I do on every case."
-l don't think there'll be a trial.
-Tell your boss you want to go to bat.
I think he'll deal anyway.
"Girls, I'll meet you outside."
Get her.
Okay.
"Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they?"
There we go.
"Cute, though, huh?"
How much?
- 700.
- 700?
"Yes, well, I'll tell you what."
You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days.
"Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight."
We're going to a French restaurant...
Le Bistro.
"It's five stars, so..."
I don't know if you've been to it.
"That sounds great, but this has been declined."
Declined?
You're kidding me!
Oh!
Makes me so mad.
"Like, the credit card companies..."
the way they waste your time.
Probably protecting me.
I spent a lot of money today.
Try that one.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Did it not go through?
What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?
- I love that bed.
- Don't buy this act.
* You can't throw out your uncle from Spokane *
"* Mmm, that's what you think"
* How I've longed to meet somebody like you soon *
* If I never meet you that'll be too soon *
No!
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here
* Palsy Walsy..
Let me throw 'em out.
Did you ever play football?
* Met your darling mother your sister too *
* They're young as ever and so are you *
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here * [crowd applauding]
You hear that?
We're a hit.
"And to see, I owe it all to you."
[applause continues]
[clapping and whistling]
[knocking on door]
Who is it?
[knocking continues]
"Hello, partner."
'Thanks.
I'll wait out here.'
Would you mind passing me out a chair?
Hello.
Will you tell the manager that one of those fresh college boys is annoying me?
I'm the manager.
Get away from that door!
And you wouldn't consider this an emergency?
"Just give us 2 hours, and the notebook will be recovered by then."
Perhaps less than two hours.
Just one and a half.
"- Give me Academician Filip, please."
- Is it OK?
Filip speaking.
"Following a thorough evaluation of the situation the crew of the Adam 84 Expedition has decided, that..."
This is CWB.
This is the Central World Brain.
The connection is lost.
CWB is powerless in the matter.
"Well, what do you say?"
Where did she go now?
Eh?
Poochie!
Stupid Bernau!
Give it to him!
Are you scared?
You'll get some more tomorrow at school!
Just wait!
"What've they done to you, Adam?"
"Oh, it's just my shirt."
But they couldn't take the notebook from me.
What's so important to them about it?
Secret calculations.
It's not suitable for girls.
- Unless...
- Why are you so secretive?
Perhaps some girls could...
Adam!
Stop messing about!
[sighs]
But look at me now.
"Mom, lie down for a while."
The Sergeant will come back later.
I just remembered something.
"That's more like it, Mrs. Slocum."
I sent my black taffeta to the cleaners... and it's never gonna be back in time for that meeting at the women's club.
[sighs]
I'll be back.
"Really, Sergeant."
My mother's a wonderful woman.
She just suffers from overacting.
That's the understatement of the year.
"Oh, mercy."
You must be that detective.
"Say, I got a few ideas about that murder."
I'll bet you have.
[scoffs]
Well.
"Where's your mother, honey?"
"Mrs. Armstedder, take it easy."
She's really had a rough day.
"There you are, Lottie."
"Boy, do you look a mess."
"Well, come on, honey, refreshments."
We got a lot of talking to do.
Now.
Oh.
Move over.
Isn't this exciting?
Look at that.
"""Baby-sitter questioned in murder."""
Appreciate it.
"Ooh, it's cold."
You think you could just pick this shit up tomorrow?
- Ma'am.
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Oh, God."
"Fuck you, America."
You have 14 new voice memos.
"Oh, my God."
"Mike, some old golfer died."
Do I need to say something?
Next memo.
"Kent, I just got your document."
I have no idea what any of this means.
Next memo.
"Oh, okay, Kent."
"I just found the glossary, so ignore that last message."
Next memo.
"Ted, I've just read the glossory."
I have no idea of any of it means.
That's why I included the second glossory.
Next memo.
"Mike, is it pissing you off I'm leaving all these messages?"
Yes.
Next memo.
"Good, because it's pissing me off you're not answering any of these messages."
Next memo.
How do you leave a memo in your sleep?
- See you.
- Next memo.
"Mike, were you at work today?"
I don't remember seeing you.
I couldn't never understand why you don't want to introduce us to each other.
Why won't you invite him to our house?
What does Garik have to do with it?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm fed up with it!
I got interested.
"I started gathering information about Garik, his family and work."
I found some data.
Come and look.
He's gone.
He died the next year after your graduation.
He died almost 30 years ago.
Your best friend died.
You could have invented something more convincing and not use such cruel lie.
I'm leaving.
I can't live like this any longer.
I'm so scared with you!
- Hello?
- Hello?
"Hi, old man!"
Garik!
Is that you?
It's me.
Who else could it be?
What's wrong with your voice?
- Aren't you dead?
- What?
Who is dead?
Are you drunk again?
You're dead.
Well...
You died and I went crazy.
- Why are you following me?
- EMMA:
It's Dad.
He's back.
"- What up, my Lakewood Sixers?"
"Though, technically, there are only five of us at the moment."
What?
"No one's talked to him since we, like, broke up?"
Talking about Jake Fitzgerald.
"That's your boyfriend, right?"
- (SCREAMING)
- STAVO:
"Finally answered, huh?"
He must really love you.
"All you people who think you know everything about the Lakewood Six, you don't know us."
"Brooke, you're special to me."
I don't even know who you are.

There's stuff in there that might belong to Piper.

Answer it.
Yes?
It's for you.
Sit down.
Yeah?
Okay.
I see you.
What do I want?
How about a world cruise and a winning lottery ticket?
( chuckles )
Why don't you come up here?
We can talk about it.
Just you.
Your little friends can wait down there.
"Hey, sit down."
What do you think you're doing?
I'm gonna get some ice for my neck because you hurt me.
"And tomorrow morning, after the FBI either lock you up or shoot you dead,"
"I'm gonna have to get up and go to work like any other day, and I'd just as soon do that looking as fresh and pretty as possible."
"Get some water for Charlie, will you please, Cynthia?"
CYNTHIA:
Yeah.
Anybody else?
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"We got to get him out of here, Ray."
Dear Max
I'm thinking of you.
And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you.
Can't you still?
Did you realize that it's not the same now?
We don't love each other anymore.
That's what the letter said?
Nothing else?
Did it say something about me?
Yes.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Can't you say those things about me?
You've never wanted to know them.
Well now I do.
What do they matter now?
!
To me they do!
Tell me!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Then tell me!
You're nuts!
That's what you think about me?
No.
That would be so easy!
"Besides, you'd take that as a compliment!"
I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you like to live in the countryside?
Always.
I'd stay here.
I couldn't get used to it.
"- dang. jake ain't nothing but a paintballer -- no future and currently dead, by the way."
"kind of sad, though."
he didn't shoot blanks.
- [gasps] you're useless!
"- geez, i was just having fun."
i'm gonna get a refill.
[door creaks]
- you guys seen randy?
[toilet flushing] excuse me.
"oh, my god!"
ohh!
what is that?
- it's pizza with a hint of hard-boiled egg.
- that's disgusting.
- i don't know whether to be grossed out or hungry again.
"- okay, you have serious problems."
"look, have you seen randy?"
me and him are supposed to hook up.
- no.
- have you seen randy?
- excuse me.
y-you can see me?
"- well, yes."
"if you're standing right there, i can see you."
- what?
no. no.
how did that happen?
- have you seen him or not?
"- i, um -- no, i haven't."
"- have another drink, why don't you?"
- i think i will.
[knock on door]
I don't know no Paula.
What's this?
What's this thing here?
"You're ill, Mr. Biberkopf."
Your head and arm were injured.
I want outta here.
I have my work!
I have things to do!
Soon.
What's going on here?
What's wrong with me?
I have to get your particulars.
"You don't mind, do you?"
Let's see.
You were run over on May 12 on the Eberswalderstrasse.
Name:
Franz Biberkopf.
Auto accident.
"Did you step in front of the car, or what?"
"No, no."
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate once more.
Here's the perfect rubber band for a gentleman.
"It won't snap, split or break."
Made from the very best materials.
The whole family could hang from this rubber band.
"Pull that end, young man."
Harder!
It won't bounce back like a bad check!
So you're not married.
No children either?
Sorry ― dumb question.
Get back!
"Move, move, get out of the way!"
What's going on?
They're under the ground!
Look out!
They're under the ground!
"All units, all units, be advised."
Air support en route to Pine Street Park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh, this does not look good."
You were actually near where...
"Yeah, no, it was just right there."
Was it over here?
- The south side.
- Okay.
It was just huge.
- You saw it yourself?
- Yes.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.
An I.E.D. maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
Holy crap...
It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past, there were multiple occasions."
He's not finished yet.
So you know this case?
Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth, but it was never found."
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.
All the questions became meaningless.
My existence is for you.
- This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me.
Let me go.
"- Wait Saira, wait!"
The dogs had got it!
One of the bitches had bitten off its head.
- Feathers were flying everywhere...
- Charles!
(VIOLENT COUGHING)
Now see what you've done!
What the devil's the matter with him?
He has trouble with his lungs.
Makes a misery of his life.
He should be bled.
We have an excellent physician.
He's developed a special variety of leeches.
"Painless, and they leave very little mark."
"Better yet, send in George to Monsieur Chopin."
She leaves no mark at all.
"Hungarian humour, George."
(CRASH)
- You are too familiar.
Apologise.
"- Sit down, you ass!"
- You think I don't know what's going on?
- She has made love with Monsieur Liszt?
Apologise or I'll rip your throat out!
Apologise!
- Agh!
Alfred!
- St George!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the dragoon.
I was invited.
"Duchess, I've only just arrived."
Thank God I was in time to defend Madame Sand's honour.
"- Wait, do--"
"If anyone comes in, just act like you're working or something."
"Wait, mike."
"Mikey, where are you?"
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Get over here, will you?"
I got too many irons.
"Go right over there, give the ceiling a pull, will you?"
Basic business principles went right down the drain on this thing.
You're fired!

He's an orphan.

Maybe you could use an interpreter.
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.
You number one.
I choose you.
I don't want to be chosen.
- I don't think you have much choice.
"- Choice, Mr. Hobson?"
I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this outfit.

That's all I got.
The probation officer... .
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.

This is the house of stupidity.
Can we do it now?
"Who are ""they,"" friend?"
"Marauders, maybe."
I don't know.
"The same ones that killed Silmser, huh?"
Maybe.
Now will you take these chains off?
Not yet.
That's Times' place?
That's right.
And it never runs dry?
So they say.
Get away from the rifle.
You are getting hasty.
You'll get yourself killed.
"I could die of thirst while you was being too careful, too."
- Anything in it?
- In what?
In the bucket!
"Well, it sure is heavy."
That was my shot foot you dragged me in here with!
- You gonna die on me?
- No.
- You still shoot?
- Yes!
"Friend, you wouldn't shoot me in the back?"
"Friend, if I was gonna shoot you, it wouldn't be in the back."
"Cover, please."
Just tell him to put that down on the floor.
That weapon gives him adult status.
Tommy... put it down.
Please.
"You hurt my sister, I'll kill you."
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.
- The manager is expecting me.
"- One moment, please."
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES
It's this suitcase.
- Shall I open it?
"- Yes, open it."
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.
What problem?
Something weird with a very young girl.
I think that's why he vanished all of a sudden.
Poof and he was gone.
"Rovira Galvez, Sebastian."
Sexual assault on a minor?
Whereabouts unknown...
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...
Anything else?
Any friends who know him?
"No, he has no family."
Nobody in his town ever saw him again.
He didn't even go to his mother's funeral.
"Yeah, yeah."
Thank you very much.
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!
You should know we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering 20% more than last year.
- 150 pesetas more per day.
- That's nothing!
"Silence, please!"
- No.
- Not you either?
Willy Kos... no.
I've never heard of that name.
Why?
Because she had his passport with her.
Stained with blood..
And forged.
You know nothing about this?
"No, how would I know with whom this crazy woman has associated with."
"I let her work with me out of pure compassion and good-heartedness upon her arrival from the East Zone, and for that I'm now interrogated!"
Hold on.
Bring the woman in here!
There's a possibility she might remember you.
- But what if she is dangerous?
"- What could she possibly do to you, Anna?"
"Don't worry, she's complety harmless."
My God.
She really is crazy.
Pauline.

"Pauline, oh my goodness."
What has Bruno done to you?
Bruno?

BRUNO!
What is it?
Let me go!
Everything is like it should be.
"See, she really is insane!"
"So you recognize me, right?"
Did you beat me?
He was here just now!
You'll be dead if I catch you
This is such a small place
Where can he hide?
I'm here!
"You bastard, you bastard!"
I'm so mad!
"Gao, how come you're so slow?"

Of course he won't dare to fight back!
"Come, a toast!"
What happened?

They looted the jewels...
- What?

I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
"Sadhana, please."
I did ask you.
"If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away."
"You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her."
"You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?"
"Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?"
"Mom, ask her to keep quiet."
Why should I stay quiet?
"Sadhana, be calm."
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.
"I'm sorry, aunt."
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!
"Mom, let's go."
'Who?
What?
When?
'
'Swathi was hanging out with her friends'.
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'
Sadhana.
Sadhana.
"I'm doing this for all of us, mom."
Hi!
"No, thanks."
Are you also the pride of yourparents?
"Just like me, you're not sure."
"My fatherwas a soldier, I always wanted to be like him."
He used to say:
"""I am so proud of you, son""."
Attention!
"Combat boots on, guns ready, attack!"
One afterthe other...
They all die...
Dad would be so proud of me.
At ease!
"At ease, huh?"
Dad is dead.
My condolences.
We owe our lives to dad.
I owe everything to him.
"Soldiers are immortal, nations are indivisible."
"You'll fucking serve the army too, you pussy boy Can!"
Pussy boy!
We should leave now.
These hands were so tiny.
Size of a cat's paw.
They said you wouldn't live.
So tiny.
Now look at these...
Why don't you join a support group forfallen officers' families?
You're always at home.
It's not that.
It's the seaside I miss.
The culprit is...
Jacques Dollon.
Jacques...
"It is not possible, this man is dead."
Where's the gold?
Over there.
Thank you.
"What do you want, Sir?"
"I would like to see Mr Nanteuil, please."
Private business.
Please follow me.
It is Mr Fandor.
Ask him to enter.
"Ah, Mr Fandor."
I did not think I would meet you so fast.
Mr Nanteuil.
Hello.
Sit down.
You're probably not ignoring the excitement caused in Paris by the murder of the Baroness de Vibray.
And the important theft committed against Princess Danidoff.
And how am I concerned?
"The little I know, I learned it by reading your articles in the press, Mr Fandor."
Can you confirm that the Baroness was ruined?
"Well, I do not violate the professional secret by saying"
yes.
She had undergone irretrievable losses.
And Jacques Dollon?
You think he's guilty?
A priori.
From what I've read in the press.
Why?
Do you have any doubts?
I thought you didn't believe him.
You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying?
That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant?
I'd better kill myself now.
Maybe
Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back?
"That makes sense too, doesn't it?"
What did she do?
Vacation.
Just vacation?
She'd show up at my house once a year and rest.
- Did she have someone?
- What?
Did she see someone?
How dare you?
!
"Aunt Rosa, answer us."
We just want to know if Mom had someone.
Before or after Dad.
- Why?
- Because!
Why can't just you tell us?
!
- Why are you shouting?
- Because you annoy me!
"If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything."
Algeria?
What about Algeria?
Did she have someone in Algeria?
Did she go to Algeria?
How?
They wouldn't let an Israeli in.
"Morning, girls."
Someone had a late night.
What time did the cat drag you in?
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
"Molly, you didn't."
What can I say?
Jimmy is very persuasive.
And nimble.
"You got a guy, peggy?"
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
What about mr.
Fancy?
"You know, the guy I've seen around the automat..."
"Nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders."
"Oh, no."
No.
He's just a colleague.
"Good day, ladies."
Early bird and all that.
"Ah, miss carter, please sit."
This will only be a moment.
"In 1925, the great harry houdini"
Performed at this very building.
"Ugh, houdini."
That's never good.

But the one trick he could not pull off
Was ascending the stairs.
"It's a simple rule, ladies."
No men above the first floor.
Landlord says she lives alone.
"And it appears that Pamela or JMJ or whoever, has a predilection for white cotton gloves."
He saw white cotton gloves?
Through her bathroom window.
12 pairs hanging on clothes pegs from her shower curtain.
It's her!
She's the killer!
She's the killer!
Yeah.
The electronic scratch on those anonymous calls?
She used a device to make her voice sound like a man's.
"Sorry about the interruption, JMJ, it was rude."
My name is Pamela.
Pamela?
Do you have a light?
Hmm.
I'm confused.
Why does the lease to your apartment read JMJ Wilgis?
My lease?
"What do your initials stand for, JMJ?"
Pamela.
It's Pamela.
Then who's JMJ?
"Is she, what, your sister?"
Why does she have 12 pairs of white cotton gloves hanging on her shower curtain?
- Answer me!
- You can't treat me like crap!
- Sit down.
- Go to hell!
- Sit down!
- No!
Sit... down!

"Yes, Yes."
Only in that.
You already know that I do not want.
"But, if we are engaged."
Indeed.
Ten patience?
no?
"Have I it, she is who does not have it."
Or...
Or maybe you couldjust check it out before Maintenance gets here.
And risk angering a restless spirit?
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
That's not how I roll.
Okay.
Uh...
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Mr. And Mrs. Burke.
We will...
We will send somebody up right away.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
"Oh, and could you tell Maintenance to take a look at the shower door while they're here?"
I got stuck in there this morning.
No problem.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
The shower door?
In the same shower door where Monica was stuck?
In the same bathroom where her ashes were flushed down the toilet?
You really are superstitious?
I just figured fixing a thermostat was beneath you.
Superstitious?
No.
Spiritual?
Yes.
"I grew up in my grandmother's house, Danny."
"And when she died, strange things started happening."
Footsteps when there was no one there.

Girls are supposed to like that.
I do not need the chase.
"Bella,you're a control freak."
You love a project.

I don't...
I don't want ambivalence.
I want to be adored.
Johnny's great.
The guy touches my face.
You know how many face-touching guys are left out there?
I hope it's a similar amount to the number of hand-washing guys.
"Good morning,my love!"
"Dude,just sack up,already."
Geez!
I saw it.
It was fine.
It was cute.
Whatever.
Excuse me.
Gotta go to the office.
Later.
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Were you hanging from it?
Nothing.
I don't know.
It's old.
- You had sex right there.
- Shut up.
- Right where your father is.
There's no time.
"Gemma, run, please, go!"
Fuck.
She could... s-she could've cut us free.
"Tools, weapons."
We-we could have fought.
We could have run away.
"You can't run anywhere, babe."
"You did well, Luke."
You showed guts.
"Oh, you keep it."
You're in the family now.
I trust you with it.
- What if someone finds out?
"- Trust me, Luke."
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over... we can just disappear.
Lie low while my father's people deal with these loose ends.
Your father knows about this?
This whole business has shamed him more than anyone else.
My duty was clear.
Restore family honour by any means necessary.
- What?
- I knew he had my back.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
"Did you send the postcard, El?"
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad we got that cleared up.
This is the last leg.
You're almost there.
- Stand still!
- Get out.
All right.
No one will come in here.
Stay on the door.
The Frenchman.
What'd he say?
It's about us being revolutionaries like him.
The captain wants to see me about him now.
Got the petition?
Take care of him.
"We are revolutionaries, but they do things properly."
The French with the guillotine!
"We've had this ship, and Scott-Padget's still alive!"
Wait.
You can go now.
Come in.
"You wish to see me, sir?"
- Mr. Crawford?
- Sit down.
Where are we heading?
"Oh, my committee aren't decided yet."
"Caribbean, South America..."
Anywhere but England.
It's of England I wish to speak to you.
Colonel Giraud has vital information about an intended invasion.
- That's the truth.
- Invasion?
We got the landing places and the approximate date out of him.
But he knows a great deal more.
He must be handed over for questioning at once.
Handed over?
I wanted...
I wanted to do something that used the part of my brain that was healthy.
"So, what's different now?"
I know how the world sees me.
And people with schizophrenia aren't lawyers.
They're bag ladies.
So prove them wrong.

It's about my mother.
There was the one I told my friends about... the mom I wished I had.
She mostly lives in my snow globe.
Then there was Up Mom.
You see what I'm talking about?
You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
- You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- It's going to better use there.
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-We help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"- Paige, you started lying to us."
- I didn't lie.
"- Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
- Do you?
- Lie...
Lying...
- Stop!
What are you doing?
You go behind our backs.
Why?
Does this book tell you to do that?
- Philip.

"You're a fucking rabbit and headless, aren't you?"
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's alright, you can put your hands down now."
"Three years, I've been waiting for this moment... and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin."
"For fuck's sake, come on!"
"Well, let's have a look, chick."
"Open the glove-box, please."
And get that whole contraction.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you...?
Are you married?
How's that working out for you?
"Yes, poor shocker."
Bright.
"Next, I need you to, uh... take your shirt off."
You knew the whole time!
"All of you, you're all a bunch of idiots!"
"Jimmy, we've lost the war."
Women and children will suffer more than anyone.
You're pigs!
A country full of pigs!
- And what about you?
- Shut your mouth!
You go into homes certain you can... buy everything with chocolate and cigarettes.
I loved her.
You loved her?
So what's stopping you?
You're a pig!
A pig from Cleveland!
I wanted to marry her!
Isn't that her man?
Always there when I need you...
"I won't forget the chastity belt, Cliffton."
At least I haven't forgotten to wear it until now.
- Worried about syphilis?
- I can't believe it!
VDs can be more destructive... than war.
But thanks to penicillin...
"Yes, Captain?"
You're one hour early.
Hospital?
"Yes, I'm coming."
- Could I make a phone call?
- Yes.
- Excuse me.
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling Ted...
Some other time.
- You're here this afternoon?
- Yes.
Then come and see us.
I'm always here.
I'm often here at night too.
I'm an old hand here.
If you need anything...
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
- So long.
Mr.Roncero...
Good morning.
- Shall I get Dr.Vega?
"- No, carry on with your work."
"The other day, going through my papers,"
I found some notes I took the day you came to see me.
I'd written down a topic to discuss on your second visit.
A visit that never took place.
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
"Don't be afraid, let him have a rest only."
Let some get fat only kilo.
Did you see that he ate the in crumbs chicken two times?
"Well...what right, it right."
"Ow, my mother, my mother,my sweet good mother, why you left me?"
!
Ow!
What is it?
Was somebody wounded?
"Nothing happened, major lord."
As if I would have heard a groan.
Well...
I was it.
As if somebody would have kept recalling his mother.
Well...is an a kind of bad habit only.
I like stretching out and then very...
I gtoan.
Yes?
I am really glad about this.
He fidget.
Why are you surprised at this?
100 mortal dangers is every day.9 months are in constant noise and smelliness.
"Well...what right, it right."
Let's go.
Let us lie.
Enough were the today's day already.
What was that?
Who's here?
Stop!
Who are you?
Major lord.
This evening is beautiful.
- It's a little tight.
"- Yes, that's to correct your posture."
Soon you'll have a mighty hump.
Now you really are my son.
This calls for a celebration.
Let's fire some employees.
Excellent.
"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard."
"If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you without using the letter ""E""... you can keep your job."
"Uh, okay."
Um--
- I'm a good work-- guy.
- You're fired.
- But I didn't say--
- You will.
Eeeeeeee!
[ Chortling ]
Let me try one.
Mmm.
Mmm.
"Hey, the trail of donuts ended."
- [ Gasps ] Bart!
- [ Gasps ] Homer!
[ Gasps ] What a coincidence!
And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty.
"Go ahead, Bartholomew."
You may fire when ready.
- [ Groans ] - [ Whimpers ]
Hurry.
Fire him now or I'll disown you.
You'll lose everything.
"The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury... the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video... the freedom to do whatever you want."
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."
You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."
What the hell?
Power's gone out again.
Fuck.
I keep telling the Captain to get that damn wiring fixed.
Never listens!
What the fuck!
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?
"- Outside, that... fuck!"
- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
I could show you around the country.
We'd always be together.
"If I could live here, I wouldn't have to rent the place in town."
You didn't sell yourself well as a prospective roommate.
- What do you mean?
- You should know!
Gerd is still looking for new ski instructors.
- I don't want to.
- Why not?
- I have enough to do.
- You could earn a lot more.
I earn just as much with the translations.
"""Forest Ranger's Love""..."
"""Hour of Desire."""
You'd be a great ski instructor.
But I don't want to.
Ridiculous!
- What?
- Your attitude.
You never try anything new.
- What'll I tell Gerd?
- What about?
- Your refusal.
Where did you get that idea anyway?
- I told him.
- What?
For your sake.
You'd earn twice as much.
"Thanks, but I'm grown up."
"Oh, yeah?"
Don't you ever want to achieve anything?
You can talk!
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"No, don't, don't!"
Don't!
Don't!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
"Oh, fuck."
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.
It's jumped from zero to 18K in five milliseconds...
I'm sorry.
"The experience was more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper."
I hope you can forgive us.
...allluggageunderthe seat in front of you.
All electronic devices should now be turned off and stowed as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication...
Mum?
Mum?
I have to call him.
Mum?
Why did Cooper go?
- I...
"- Mom, I'm right here."
I'm...
"- I'm right here, Mum."
- I have to call Cooper.
I have to call and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
A month back...?
Meeting...?
Is your meeting more important than your daughter's marriage?
Cancel that silly meeting.
Keep quiet.
You remember half  forget half.
Ministers meeting...?
"As said, fix the engagement in 2 days time."
Thank you.
Find out when was the Ministers meeting in Malaysia finalised.
Oh God!
My bladder is full.
Hey Halwa...
I can't take this tension.
I don't know how you will behave.
Tell me your next plan.
I'm planning to surrender.
Don't be tensed.
I am not selfish.
I give charity to everyone.
"Once I surrender, I will tell them your name too."
Even you will find some kick.
I'll be back soon.
- What should I do now?
- Run.
You...
You heard me right.
I said that.
Buy the ticket  run away before they lynch you.
You must know why we got separated.
I won't listen to you.
This is very important.
"But the box was to be opened only if the Faction System broke down, which is why it requires someone like you to open it."
You are living proof that the Divergent problem has grown beyond all control.
Do you even hear what you're saying right now?
No one thinks it's your fault that you were born this way.
"Jeanine murdered an entire faction, Caleb."
That faction could no longer be trusted.
She killed our parents.
Our parents brought that on themselves.
What are you talking about?
The box?
It was in their house.
They were the ones hiding it.
All of those lives could have been spared.
Seems we didn't know our parents as well as we thought we did.
(DOOR OPENS)
All right.
Family reunion's over.
It's time to go.
"I got a little surprise for you, Tris."
TRIS:
Four?
Tris!
- Tris!
Tris!
-Four!
Four!
- Tris!
-Four!
Four!
Stop!
Four!
Foufl
- Yeah.
- The end.
And the last.
- Anyone wanna talk about auditioning?
"- Oh, God."
"Oh, yeah."
"Remember, there was that huge to-do about my hair and my makeup and all that stuff on my last audition."
"Remember, Pete?"
Remem...?
Somebody went...
Did you go shopping for clothes?
- I went shopping for clothes.
- You brought options.
- I bought 800...
- That was the first time we met.
- That's right.
- We read together.
"Pete and Kerry Kohansky gave me pointers and really helped me out, you know."
Was this something I shouldn't talk about?
Never mind.
- That was all a lie.
- We should talk about...
Let's rewind and...
"Wait, seriously, should we go redo that?"
"No, it's okay."
"Oh, shit."
"Should we talk about that today is September 24th, 2008?"
- It's one week till the premiere.
- What's today?
"One week from the premiere, today."
- We have one week till the premiere.
- That's exciting.
"Well, you sirs show no patriotism."
Fine english fabrics!
"Fine english fabrics, Mr Biberkopf!"
I'd rather hope so!
I could never fool myself.
Stop tickling me!
I'll have someone pick my rags up later.
Mieze!
Look!
Be astonished!
- You look very fine!
- Look at me!
Clothes make the man!
- Now it's your turn!
- No no no!
Oh come on!
"Business is going well so we can afford decent clothes, can't we?"
- You'll get your money!
Goodbye.
- I hope so.
Goodbye Mr Biberkopf.
2 bottles of sparkling wine!
Where is the party?
- Knew it!
"- Just some ""celebrities""."
"No, I already told you I won't come along."
I'm not dressed accordingly.
It's your choice.
"Guys like us, looking fine."
I'm not gonna let Franz walk all over me.
"Just watch out for him, he might cause trouble for us with his money-spending habit"
He's an amateur!
The aunt is jealous of me!
"You mustn't say that, dear!"
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show we'd have had a video-library!
You're lying!
Stop this nonsense!
"Let me talk to her, sir."
"Well, Kaushi?"
Why did you do that?
"You dare steal here, Kaushalya!"
Impudent woman!
"Dangerous woman, sir!"
She's playing the Bandit Queen!
"You, too?"
Shut up!
"Who else, if not I?"
!
The neighbours won't ask if my house is robbed!
"I ran out of battery, or I'd have shot the night-scene..."
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?
"Call the police, Banwa."
"That's not necessary, sir!"
I'll personally throw her out!
Shameless creature!
You dare bite the hand that feeds!
"Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!"
Yes.
The garden is the ideal place.
Let's go...
"The plate, Banwa..."
Sure.
What`s going on?
Rusty is licking his hand and touching me with it!
tell Rusty to behave himself.
"Rusty, behave yourself!"
Audrey is eating candy and smiling with it stuck all over her teeth!
"Audrey, eat with you mouth closed!"
"No eating in the car, kids!"
"You suck, you know that?"
Retard!
I am trying to concentrate on the road!

"Eddie, come on!"
I can`t believe it!
"Eddie, you look terrific."
Come and meet your second cousins!
I don't have anymore.
"Otherwise, I would give you another one."
Don't worry about it.
Don't let them get you down!
"They can all go to hell, right?"
"Great, three days of ravioli."
How was your audition?
They expired last year.
Throw them away.
"Nonsense, what else should we cook?"
Are you going to sing for Toni?
"Well, if I survive the ravioli."
Then that'll be your new job?
Right.
Then you won't work here anymore?
You can always visit me.
Would you like that?
I don't care.
"- No Tom, and no ravioli  but for actual money."
... without Tom.
Bon appetit!
"For tonight's special event, it's best to pray  because it's probably dangerous."
- What?
The food has expired!
If that was the only thing?
Same old story.
Amen.
Amen.
- No ravioli?
No thank you.
- No thanks.
"I bet he goes to a restaurant afterwards, and takes Babette with him."
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
- He doesn't know about it?
- No.
- He's my old friend.
- Right.
I need you to help to talk her out of it.
Just like a breast intervention.
How am I supposed to bring this up?
That's okay.
I'll think of something.
You always think of something.
I don't know.
Is everything else good in your life?
- Be honest with me.
- Hmm?
"For the first time in over a quarter of a century, tell me something that's really bugging you."
I have nothing to confide.
You have experienced a lot you have not shared.
"You've mentioned this to me that I don't confide in you,"
- and there's nothing to confide.
- You haven't confided in me
- in your entire life.
- How could you say...
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Uncle Richard!
Look at you from top to bottom.
"What a doll, huh?"
"- Oh, baby."
- Hi.
This is my fake niece Kim.
Larry David.
"OK, Number Two."
Right.
Go!
"OK, Number Three."
"Stand by, Number Three."
Ready.
Go!
Look at mine.
"Oh, the silly, clumsy clot."
"OK, Number Five."
They're not a bad bunch.
I've seen worse.
Gardner!
From now on I'm in business strictly with you.
"Nothing like an old, established firm."
Heavy.
Hm.
How about a drink tonight?
I might be able to manage...
Have a nice trip?
You didn't have to push me.
"No offence, just trying to help."
I don't need that kind of help.
What makes you such a ruddy hero?
It just ain't natural.
If he puts his hands on me again I'll brain him.
How about that drink?
"Thank you, but this firm doesn't mix business with pleasure."
"Gentlemen, we don't know one another very well yet."
This morning you start your training and we can start to find out.
Now for myself.
"Information, I'm a professional soldier."
"Come on, Nami."
What's wrong?
No!
OK. I understand.
What happens is nothing to do with me!
Nothing whatsoever.
Who could do this?
Is she a porn model?
That can't be allowed.
I'm wondering what I should do as her supervisor.
There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case.
She's just a slut.
Yes.
It can't be tolerated.
Trust is very important in this industry.
Lay her off.
Of course.
"She looked nice, though."
Come with me.
No.
You're working at the department store?
Have you been following me?
What's wrong?
Has something happened to you?
Stop talking as if you're a friend.
Take this umbrella.
You should go home now.
I just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this.
I didn't intend to do anything like that.
Leave me alone.
I've had just about enough of it.
Please be quiet.
Wait!
Those beautiful days of childhood.
"50 years later, the Nobel laureate Adam Bernau wrote in Volume One of the Memoirs, page 63, ""I was dreaming about discoveries that could improve the life of the entire human race."""
I'd like to emphasize that I don't agree.
It's pointless.
There is no other way.
Get ready...
We're going.
Helicopter!
Maximum alert!
"This is gonna cost you a lot, pal!"
- Where do you think that car was?
- There.
"I saw it, but then it drove off that way."
And what happened to the hut?
It just collapsed all by itself?
Look!
Rum!
It's worse than that.
It's brandy.
- But I... please...
- We know!
I'm impressed!
"The car only used up 30% energy,"
Instead of the allowed 70%.
Thanks to you!
- I'll remember that!
"- And you wanted to return, remember?"
"- Well, yeah."
"I'll never forgive you, you understand?"
Unless...
"So, what is it?"
You don't think you can eat that.
We're building us a smudge pot so Patton can find us when he comes.
"Twenty parts of cellulose, one part phosphorous."
Watch.
He'll be able to see our smoke signal four miles away.
But Patton is 400 miles away.
"Well, I say, be prepared."
"- Heh, Ok, boy scout."
"-Hey, look what we got."
- The phonograph!
- Music!
"Put it down here, boys."
- We made a deal with Barracks 1.
"-Now, where's that distillery?"
"Over here, boys."
Let's have that distillery.
"Come on, we swapped it for the phonograph."
"Any objections, Sefton?"
Take it.
"- Hey, Price."
Any news on Dunbar?
-Huh?
"He's still at the kommandants office, that's all I know."
Don't worry.
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
- We'll give him a hearty welcome then
- Hurrah!
Hurrah!
The men will cheer and the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
The tourist is still on the loose.
But I have a hunch Daddy's gonna come back for his little girl.
So he's still alive.
"Not for very long, he isn't."
Don't screw up this time!
Motts!
You stay here with him.
Hey!
Do I look like I need a babysitter?
Sit down and shut up!
"Oh, shit."
Mr. President.
I..
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability..
to launch missiles at any target in the United States.
Our satellites show massive troop movements..
"in Russia, Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula."
"What are your orders, sir?"
"I swear to you all, I swear.."
that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!
No.
General..
how soon can you execute an air strike on the White House?
Sir.
We can have Raptors on target in 10 minutes.
Then do it.
Let's go to work!
Sir..
"Carol, we have to end this."
We have to.
I'm not like him!
Then I'll be the one who break your ribs if you are!
- Break my ribs?
- Beat you hard!
How are you?
"Times without you, are my wonderful times!"
"Sounds like, you do miss me!"
"But, what can I do?"
Seems like I don't miss you!
"What you have just said, makes me even happier than knowing you are a love child!"
Nice ring!
- Is that from your boyfriend?
"- Yes, it is."
You the first to know.
Engagement ring.
So I should congratulate you guys!
When will you guys getting married?
Hurry up!
- I can't believe that he is still shy!
- That's not related!
- Wine...
- Wine...
Let's toast for Yawang!
- Toast!
- For what?
"An early wish to you and Xiaotian, for eternal happiness in marriage, and have a baby boy soon!"
Great!
Have a baby boy!
Drink it!
I want to go to the toilet.
Hurry!
Whay do you want?
Mm-hmm.
"Need anything else, agents?"
"Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?"
Sorry.
She's out for the rest of the week.
"Hell of a time to take a vacation, right?"
"Okay, so, we have two victims, with seemingly nothing in common except, uh -- a love for eclairs."
Check this out.
What is that?
A birthmark?
Huh.
"So the weight had to come off somehow, right?"
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?
Okay.
"Uh, changeling?"
"Yeah, but changelings don't take over kids."
Neither of the vics had any.
And we don't know if Wayne McNut had a suction mark.
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.
"Well, we should, uh, split up."
One of us should hit the morgue.
The other should stay here and question the staff.
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.
Why?
Because you're weird around girls.
"What does that mean, weird?"
You're awkward.
"You know, weird -"
- Sam Weird.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing without Jeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care of Jenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
This hallowed home of ours... we hold sacred
Here we dreamt our dreams
Like a prayer in a temple
Like a ray from the skies
Here we find succor
There were three parts to the will.
Mr. Malhotra donated a huge sum to many charities... one million Euro to his staff and everything else to Tisha.
But that will was burnt.
"Which means, according to the law..."
Mr. Malhotra died without a valid will.
"And that means... his only heir, inherits all his wealth."
Tisha gets everything.
Correct.
How much exactly is everything?
10 billion Euro.
"Sia, it's Tisha."
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She did what?
"Attempted suicide, sir."
She's at St. Marks' hospital right now.
What the bloody hell is going on?
"Sia, you go to the hospital."
I'll meet you at HQ later.
Let's go.
"I'm sorry, but I need to question Tisha."
"- Any problem, officer?"
- No.
It's just routine.
I'll wait.
Dad...
"That's fine, thank you."
"Tisha, what happened?"
I...
I...
I don't know.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
What?
"I'm sad, too."
It's okay to grieve.
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something I can learn to make this better.

"Yeah,it'sokaynot toknow ."
"Sometimes you don't know, and you may never know, and that's okay."
"Come on, let's get you out of here."
I think somebody needs to work on their sense of humor.
It was a joke.
Oh.
I'm Monica.
Got it.
Monica.
"So, Mike- Yes?"
What sort of impression do I make?
Come again?
If we were in a bar and you hadn't seen me before.
Oh.
Can I speak candidly?
I insist you speak candidly.
I'd think you were a hot piece of ass.
Good answer.
- Sarasvati.
"- Yes, Miss Mancuso?"
You told me you would have the opening day revenue report by now.
Where is it?
I'm afraid it's still being prepared.
Unacceptable.
Mr. Deline had some special requests.
He suggested you speak to him.
Come on.
Show some cleavage.
"It's a casino, not a convent."
"Okay, okay."
That's me taking the first counterfeit I found.
"Now, let's run it backwards... until we see that specific tray being removed from the cart."
All right?
Wow.
That's an easy gig.
No soldiers or militiamen.
- And the people who live here?
- They've fled.
The bastards' last visit must have convinced them to find a better place.
I'm picking up radio messages about troop movement along the border.
All right.
Drive on.
- I'm sorry that we have to say goodbye now.
- We'll meet again.
"- Goodbye, Mariá."
- Goodbye.
- Come on.
- I want to stay with Mariá.
No.
You're going with Padre Julio.
You're staying with him for a while.
"As soon as this war is over, we'll be together again."
I promise.
"Come on, Pablito."
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Don't drink so much Communion wine.
- We have a lot to do.

They get scared when you say boo!
They're cowards.
Something must have happened.
They were talking about Ramírez.
It must be important.
Listen for as long as you can.
See you at the pass.
How are you?
All has been arranged?
"All, the meeting will be in Quito."
Shall we?
lets.
"Your attention please,"
Equatorian Aviation announces the arrival of flight 422 from Guayaquil.
Something for the press?
"Please, tell us something about the convention."
"Well,we have selected the best models."
and we will present the most exclusive of swimsuits.
I am certain it will be a big success.
As we all are.
"A photo please, thanks."

"No, wait, Adriana!"
"Hold it, Adriana, its me!"
I can see you!
"My goodness, I know you have improved, but, you almost broke my neck."
Then why do you startle me?
I'll buy you a drink
When did you return?
I just came in.
This is my first night off.
is it?
First night?
Do you accept that drink?
Then we shall meet tonight!
"Say, Adriana, come here, wait!"
"Oh, excuse me."
Alex!
"Inspector, what are you up to?"
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
"Varun, what are you doing?"
- Leave me!
I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
"- I'll tell you, give it to me."
Wait here.
Where...

Hello.

Don't talk.
Stay on line.

Where is it?
Professor.
I'm coming.
"What's the line in the riddle about, uh, the ancients and the Book."
"""The Book shall summon up the power of the ancient ones."""
The Book shall summon the power.
The Book.
Give me the Book.
"You want the treasure, give me the Book."
These aren't book pages.
But what else could they be?
They're punch cards.
It must be an ancient...
"It's a computer, and these cards program it."
"Kelly, slide these in where the symbols match."
"Professor, let me see the Torch."
Here.
But how does it run?
A computer needs electricity.
Maybe not.
The people of Atlantis tapped into the volcano for power.
They used geothermal technology.
You mean this thing runs on heat?
No.
Steam.
Look!
Treasure chests.
Stay back.
It's nothing but paper.
There must be something more than pure casualty.
What makes you more scared?
To be alone...

You always look so tired.
"Sire, here is your speech."
Unbearable.
It won't retweet.

Mr. Bulut notified me about the evening schedule.
Dance of Whirling Dervishes at 6 p.m.
A short speech at the end would be appropriate.
"Please refrain from mentioning Iraq, Syria,"
"Israel, the Kurds, Armenia, our federal issues and debt."
Soccer is a touchy subject as well.
Banquet starts at 8 p.m. Nine courses.
No kebab?
"Sire, the press conference in Miniatürk starts at 11 a.m."
"Your speech, Sire."
"So we won't think about it now, will we?"
"No, sir."
"When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Well...
What would my little cherub like to do this evening?
"Oh, sir, could we go out?"
Out?
"You mean gad about a bit, see the sights?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir?"
"Well, now, I don't know."
I don't know.
That might be very charming.
Where would we go?
"Oh, they say that the Empire and such places..."
They do?
Who does?
"Well, Marcia, sir."
She says it's ever so gay.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yes.
"We can go, can't we?"
They say that the bill is ever so good.
And I haven't been out for so long.
No.
"No, that's right."
"You haven't, have you?"
You do look a little pale.
Yes.
"Yes, that's true."
"Not that I am complaining, you understand..."
Say something!
Father...
"Are you all right, Esther-san?"

"Don't worry, the count is all right!"

No idea.
"But if he's going to target Her Majesty, it would most likely be during tonight's funeral..."
He will come!
There's no question about it!
I'll go do my rounds again.
Don't worry!
I won't let him assassinate anyone!
Esther!
Yes?

The count is in your hands.
I'm coming with you!
No!
Would you mind autographing this for me?
Where did you get my picture?
From a little frame out by the door.
"Oh, hold on, that's mine."
"Oh, well, I'd prefer whenever you're smiling."
"- Do you, ever?"
"- Yes, when I'm amused."
"You know, I think I could use you in my fall production."
I don't play animal-act.
"No, really."
I'm putting on a Broadway show next season.

When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.

Your smile itself is mysterious.
If you can spare a moment from looking at me..
..then let me know what you'll drink.
Whatever you want.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do it?
"You got jealous, right?"
I mean... you are drinking alone to drown your sorrows.
You could have joined me.

"And to buy, you have to pay!"
Enjoy it?
"Snap, rush, touchdown!"
"Here, they shield everything in the same way."
"Their women, their armchairs, their money, their paintings."
"They're so wary, and rightly so."
Now we're fisting!
- Glitz and glamor...
"- Come on, Prince!"
Like some shit?
Have it!
Choke on it!
See that!
"Fisticuffs, huh?"
Do you think I look snazzy enough?
"My partings, my nails... my feet?"
My earrings.
He will notice
Where 's your corset?
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.
But you are not properly dressed
"Who is to say what is ""proper""?"
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head, would you wear it?"
Alice ...
"For me, a corset is like a codfish"
"Please, not today."
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
"It's always the same, ever since I can remember"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
"Now, can you manage to smile?"
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive
"Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you ."
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4?
Now everything I've been rushed through
- I am sorry.
"- Oh, nevermind."
Forgive my wife.
I am serious!
"You are not my type, and... we are not suitable each other, and..."
I... don't like girl with big face!
Mr...
Mr. Chen!
I'm not talking about you.
Who did this?
Who put these porn photos inside my book?
"These are not mine, Sir!"
Really not mine!
Not mine!
It hurts!
"Sir, those are not mine really!"
I'm innocent!
Yawang!
- Yawang.
- Yes...
Do you want to earn some pocket money?
Money?
"Yes, of course!"
What should I do?
- Be a private tutor.
- For whom?
His name is Xiamu.
His father was my best friend.
"When he was 4, his father lost everything in business and committed suicide!"
"His mother could not stand the pressure from creditors, and hung herself!"
Most unfortunately little Xiamu witnessed this.
Since then he has rarely talked and become withdrawn.
"By being his private tutor, you may help this kid."
It looks like real one!
Don't be stingy!
They're getting very close.
Blake!
How did you get back so soon?
Get ready to leave.
There's a ship coming up on you fast.
You've got about three minutes.
"We have the neutrotope now, nothing else matters."
- I'll get the others.
- I'll be back in a minute.
He's cutting it too fine.
"Come on Blake, get out of there."
"No, no I won't!"
- She must be taken back for trial.
- Agreed.
I won't go!
- Everything set?
"- Yes, ready."
Bring us across Vila.
They're locked on.
[EXPLOSION]
What was that?
I rigged a charge on the entry hatch.
"Right, I think we can get you all home now."
"Zen, set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
Confirmed.
Take us round the easy way this time.
Hello?

- He's with his old man.
How you feeling?
"Deprived on every fucking level, but ready to fight."
How you feeling?
I feel good.
Thank you.
"I'm gonna have you see a nutritionist, okay?"
"We'll cut the weight, and you won't lose so much strength."
You talk to Lisa?
I have.
"A lot of other gyms that I can go to, man."
"I'm not letting you out of the gym, pal."
"You're too important here, okay?"
I'm gonna give you everything I give Ryan.
I promise.
"Hey, what do you think about this one..."
this girl?
Got to ask Ryan about that one.
Are you jerking us around?
"Jean-MicheI, I swear by all our colleagues and all our tests that we,d never do that."
By no means.
"For the Iast time, look deep inside yourselves and tell us what to put down."
"Just check ,happy.,"
There!
"Isn,t that better?"
We deserve awards for that performance!
What?
Your explanations sure were lame.

This notebook is the work of a genius.
He was just 17.
And a prodigy.
- How do you know him?
"- I'm sorry, Duval."
I thought this was some drug deal gone south.
I thought he'd give us someone to go after.
Go after for what?
The kid who wrote this...
he's dead.
He O.D.'d.
It's not uncommon.
Exceptional intellects don't fit in.
"Without the proper care, many self-medicate."
"Based on data from our users, 83% of those with an IQ higher than 150 use some form of medication."
"Yeah, but heroin."

Others?
What others?

Duval:
This has been happening all along.
All O.D.'d like Kevin Whitfield.
All within 18 months.
Maybe there is someone to go after.
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
(BABY cries)
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
"Please, you have to tell him."
"It's okay, the baby's fine."
Not the baby.
Okay.
He killed Sean.
"-Honey, the police know."
-They don't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.

"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
"Well, not completely."
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post-traumatic stress.
Or maybe a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
You questioning my professional competence?
He sure looks bad.
"He's dying, poor old thing."

SOLDIER:
The captain's in there!
Check the damage in the dispensary!
"Everything's all right here, colonel!"
"A near miss, but nobody hurt."
- I think they've stopped.
"- Yes, sir."
This is the usual procedure.
About every other night.
Harassment.
It's pretty good shooting.
"Commo bunker, the dispensary, the team house."
It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp.
MacDANIEL:
Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.
"Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP!"
GREEN:
"Petersen, come with me."
MacDANIEL:
Who is it?
"Lt's the captain, sir."
Better move him out of there.
"-lt's a risky exercise, man."
Take care!
- Do not be afraid.
Stepa will survive my attack.
"I'm not anxious about him, I worry about you."
You may get bruised.
Nowwhat?
"Well, did you take this prisoner?"
-You really know some tricks!
- ls yourwar over?
-Over.
"- l'll teach you how to use all these tricks against me, an ex-con asshole!"
It is not a real trick.
A pal taught me this move in prison.
-Let me go!
Let me go!
- Let him go!
"Ifyou do it again, you're dead."

-Are you teaching the young ones again?
"-Yes, we are, comrade corporal."
"Well, listen to the battle order."
Tomorrow at 02:40 Odintsov's battalion will perform a battle recon mission at our hill.
Ourtask is to get as close as possible and disclose all alien firing positions.
-ls it clear?
"-Yes, completely."
Malakhov!
You are assigned to Sergeant Pozdneeva.
-What for?
I am saying that I can help you.
Have you found a clue?
Is that...?
It can't be.
This was left at the scene of the fire.
I believe that this scrap of cloth is from the cloak of Professor Moriarty.
Moriarty?
An odd little man who fancies himself a criminal genius.
"So, he stole the engine..."
Dear...!
"Please help them, Mr. Holmes."
Ouch!
Ouch!
What the devil is this?
An engine?
!
Who would dare drop such a filthy old thing out of the sky?
!
That's Moriarty's aircraft Pteranodon!
Did he intentionally drop it on me?
After him!
Give chase!
Go!
What a wonderful engine!
"With this, there's no doubt that I will win the world championship."
I knew that we couldn't win with the engine that the Professor built.
Did you say something?
Uh...well.
Nothing.
Out to sea?
Where are they heading?

- Yes.
Have you got something to tell me?
"Yes, I would advise you to get out of here."
- How many of them were there?
- Eight.
- Too bad that Carrasco wasn't there.
- That girl out there is also one of them.
"- Coronel, I'm in the militia."
- Calm down.
You mustn't get excited.
I know him.
It's true.
He was here before the guerrilleros occupied the hospital.
His name is Gutiérrez.
"- You were lucky, my friend."
"- Yes, but if you hadn't come..."
You're not supposed to talk so much.
Be quiet.
This is José Grenada.
He worked on the dam.
They seem to treat their prisoners quite well.
Did you hear them talk about their leader Carrasco on your way here?
Think carefully.
You must have heard something.
Very well.
I will never tell a bastard like you anything.
Never!
What are you waiting for?
Keep calm.
Don't panic.
Nothing's happened.
What have you done?
My name's Danny Ferman.
I'm one of the attorneys representing Malcolm Miller.
"Look, if this is about that juror, the cops already turned this place inside out."
"Okay, so I assume they checked the camera footage already."
Fakes.
Just there to scare anyone looking to cause trouble.
Like you.
Were you working the night of the assault?
You were here?
Yes.
And I've already been interviewed.
"Okay, what did you tell the cops?"
- That I don't remember seeing him.
"Bar was a little crazier than usual, but..."
My girlfriend was having a little birthday thing.
Girlfriend?
So you're...
Gay guys are the best tippers.
"Yeah, I mean, not that..."
"You know, it doesn't matter."
Anyway.
Anyway.
"Birthday, okay."
"Cake, presents, the whole thing?"
Yeah.
She needs a lot of attention.
"Did you happen to take any photo, videos or..."
Look at this.
Okay.
Recognize him?
No.
Could you send me this file?
I was drafted behind my back.
"- So, can I be discharged?"
- Discharged?
- You're gonna be impeached.
- [Both Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues] - [Hawkeye] Exactly what you need.
"- Tell me, Lieutenant Hutchinson."

Definitely not.
Day after tomorrow is your engagement.
Go.
Get ready.
What are you talking?
Do you know how badly you cheated me?
The lies you told me.
Cheating?
Lying?
For this simple matter.
Is this a simple matter.
If you know what really happened...
What happened?
I said that I joined the job for you.
I didn't like it.
"So, I quit the job."
You got the information from some idiot.
You got hurt.
Is that all?
Not only that.
Didn't you call my love silly?
"If you keep shouting at me, anyone would say that."
You were no less.
I was after you to make you say I love you.
You said that at the time of our separation.
How would I feel?
Frustrated.
What are you staring at me?
You were trying to make me remember something.
You wanted to say something.
C'mon talk.
You said you don't remember your past.
You're right.
Did you read about the nuns?
The ones who were raped by missionaries in Africa.
The priests themselves!
It's horrible!
"If you can't trust a missionary, what's to become of us?"
- They used to rape the local women.
- Really?
"Because of AIDS, they started raping the nuns."
"Oh, my God!"
And I had the missionaries on a pedestal.
I'm sure not all of them are rapists.
- I hope not.
"- No, some are pedophiles."
- What's that?
- Everybody loves fucking...
"Shut up, Antonio."
You're such a brute.
- How do the bulls look?
"- Good, but heavy."
- What do you reckon?
"- Over 1,000 lbs."
Holy shit!
I'm going to our bar.
"Lydia, remember we're eating at home."
"If the kids don't see their aunt, there'll be hell to pay."
Good luck.
Bull's coming.
"Don't cry, love."
Hello.
How is she?
"Poor thing, very bad."
There are two more crates outside.
Did you tell them?
"He knows, too?"
"You know, too?"
I'm done for.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Big deal.
Have you considered how he feels?
A guy raises three kids and 30 years later he finds out he's not their father.
"Stop being his lackey, Ricky."
It's his fault that my mom's dead.
"He paid the surgeon $3,000 under the table"
- to make sure she'd be okay.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- The Arab took a bribe.
- How do you know?
He told me-
- You believe all his 1001 Nights stories?
He's waiting outside.
Really?
Why doesn't he come in?

Wait!

I told you not to come.

Huh.
You don't want to bother with him.
I do want to bother with him.

"Lovely, thanks."
"No, don't be like that, Enid."

- These stripes are healing nicely.
"- They're still bloody painful, sir."
"His own son, eh?"
Can't the captain see what's going on?
"Hey, you, come here."
Sit down.
You said captain can't do anything.
What did that mean?
- I was guessing...
- What's it mean?
"If he went for Scott-Padget over this, there'd be a court-martial."
They'd prove he attacked an officer to protect his son.
That'd finish him.
"If Scott-Padget has influence, it'd be easily done."

Is there someone else?
There's everyone else.

"I have been trying to help you for hours, and at best, you have made zero progress."

I can tell how frustrating this is for you.
"No, I don't think you..."
"Wait, what did you just say?"
"Um, I'm sorry?"
Jack!
You cared about how I felt!
That's empathy!
- A retarded woman in her thirties.
I didn't notice she was retarded so we went back to her parents' place.
I overlooked certain telltale signs.
"""It's okay with my mum and dad."" The Bambi poster in her room."
"Anyway, don't tell anyone."
People have a hard time with it.
And sex!
Imagine the uproar.
"I didn't know, and the sex was fine."
- The sex was fine?
Very interesting.
"- Her boobs weren't retarded, okay?"
I prefer a retard with good boobs over a bright girl with stupid boobs.
That's where you eat and sing and read and so on.
"- Nice, isn't?"
- Indeed.

"Any previous military experience, Sir?"

"Talk to me, what do we have?"
(sighs)
Mochi balls.
Love those.
And a bottle of ouzo.
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?
MAX:
That sounds delightful.
"Sorry, cuz."
"If I die first,"
I want you to eat me.
Nobody's gonna eat you.
"So what are you saying, I'm not good enough for you?"
Why wouldn't you eat me?
"Guys, over here!"
"Check it out,"
"Doctor, regular MacGyver."
"Actually, it's basic physics."
The lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn.
Now all we need to do is stoke the flame.
"I'll do you one better, brah."
Oh!
- Yeah!
Whoa.
It's always nice to have flammable material.
FLIPPA:
I want to see this.
"You coming, Quute?"
"- What about the tunnel, sir?"
- Blow every charge now.
(Beeping)
"You were right, Tarrant."
That was the monorail.
Let's move.
Put down your guns.
Servalan!
Now!
"You see, I told you, Quute."
"They're marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
She got away.
"It was Servalan, wasn't it?"
"Well, we both saw her, and she seemed to recognise us."
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're ready for teleport.
About time.
Stand by to teleport.
"Slave, where are those cruisers now?"
"Sector 12, Master."
You outmanoeuvred them with consummate skill.
Thank you.
"Set a direct course for base, maximum speed."
Teleport operating.
What are you smirking about?
Do you realise we've got half the Federation battle fleet looking for us?
"The next time either of you pull a stunt like that, I warn you it may prove fatal."
We've just seen an old friend of yours.
- An implacable old friend.
- Servalan.
Absurd?
"The spirits of my ancestors are with me always, Sam."
Are you calling them absurd?
"No, absolutely not, sir."
I meant no disrespect.
It's just...
"Either way, it's bad luck to gamble under the same roof as a restless spirit."
Good-bye.
Let's go.
Mr. Wu?
Wow.
Looks like your ace just folded.
Gotta hand it to Monica.
What?
Even death can't keep that bitch from ruining my life.
"Hey, check that out."
Camera R29.
It keeps flicking on and off.
Maybe it's a monitor problem.
Can you switch the feed?
Yep.
"Nope, looks like it's the camera."
Isn't that about where Monica flew off the...
"What, you think maybe her ghost is trying to communicate with us?"
Like Morse code?
"Short, short, long..."
"That's ""Mike."""
"Short, long, long, long...""Is."""
"""Mike is going to die."""
That's very funny.
"Whoo, yeah."
- Why don't you go check it out?
-
"- Oh, aye."
Nothing to choose between them!
"Then I thought, ""Colour the hair, Granville."
"-- ""Get into colour."
"Loads of colour."" -"
- They're not really great legs.
"Then I thought, ""Maybe"" -- and I'd appreciate a second opinion --"
"""Maybe something plain."
"Severe, even."
"""Something discreet, in the shape of a single earring?"""
"Oh, yeah!"
Yeah.
Isn't that lovely?
"Oh, d--dear!"
Look at her!
That's the k--kind of advertising we need!
-
- Have you got any copper?
-
"- Oh, yes."
"One pound, thank you."
There we are!
"I'm making a study of the adverts in these glossy magazines, Granville."
There are two things that stand out.
Her two things c--certainly stand out!
But where are we going to get someone like that round here with these qualifications?
"No, who would d--dress in a c--costume like that and p--p--pose like that?"
-- (TILL BANGS) -
- Aghh!
"Oh, dear."
He'll never get the hang of that!
"Don't sell it, you owe us."
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
- Find anything?
"- No, nothing."
In the well?
Garbage.
"Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak."
Abelardo!
"Abelardo, come here!"
Carmen.
Estrellla.
"Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook."
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile.
All together so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
"No, leave it there."
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
"""Apart from the breasts..."
"""Several cuts, apparently stab wounds."
"First degree burn on the left hand."""
Let's move to the other body.
"Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax."
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
Say it again in Japanese if you dare
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
"Come on, guys!"
Faster!
Tado!
"Baso, kill him!"
I'm holding down his feet!
Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop!
All of you!
What is it?
What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop!
Stop!
Yoshi...
Yoshimura
You're in big trouble
You have the nerve to beat me up
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us!
Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all
"Let's do it, Father, before the Japanese kill us all"
Why the hell did you provoke him when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds that can only chase and hunt and know nothing of self-restraint
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
Instantly regretted.
- Where did you learn that phrase?
"- It's true, sir."
"Threatening officers is serious, but given your clean sheet I'll be lenient."
Two dozen lashes.
- I said six.
- March him out.
Right turn.
Forward march.
There were many people who heard me say six.
It was not your decision to make.
- Did you take note of that phrase?
"- Phrase, sir?"
"""An impulse, instantly regretted."""
It may mean nothing.
"But in my opinion, he'd been drilled in it."
"- Drilled, sir?"
By whom?
- I wish I knew.
- He remembered his piece.
"- It didn't save him, did it?"
It helped.
Only two dozen.
Scott-Padget must have nigh run mad.
- You know what two dozen means?
- Shut your mouth.
It means a soft captain.
My old captain on the Swift he never gave less than six dozen.
"Yes, that's what he gave me."
Six dozen.
Look here!
All hands on deck to witness punishment!
He has the sight problem.
Prestige problem to wear spectacles.
Where is your husband?
He has the ego problem.
He doesn't come unless called.
Hubby!
"Suzuki Subramanyam alias Tukaram, He transformed as the sadist husband now."
Qualities:
Infinite doubt.
Sadism:
Speechless amount.
Ego:
Unbearable amount.
Why are you shouting?
Do you think I am deaf?
I have not thought so.
- Why are you shouting then?
Tell me.
Cool brother-in-law..
How dare you touch me?
Am I your brother-in-law  [Informal] ?
I am your brother-in-law  [Formal] .
"If you can touch me, I will kick you off.."
Who are you all?
Have you come for donations?
"No sir, we came on an important work with you,"
What is that?
Look at this once.
What is this dark angle?
From how long is this going on?
Tell me how long is this happening?
"Do not hit brother-in-law, sister is like fire."
Let's go for a walk.
"Oh, thanks."
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of"
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know,"
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
"really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
That's dangerous.
like pop rocks and Coke?
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I--"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood"
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood right now."
I'mreallynotinthemood right now.
"By the way, do you have any papers?"
No.
Lock him up.
Your information proved to be correct.
The man had very considerable assets.
This is enough money for your fare.
This is a passport to America.
You are now a French citizen.
The man you caught will never know about this?
You mean your brother?
He will never know.
Did anything happen to him?
He resisted my men.
He died.
He died?
Yes.
It was one of those unfortunate things.
Your first look?
"Yes, I had only seen pictures before."
It's a big country.
Millions of people beyond those buildings.
"All of them needing something, buying something."
And what do you sell them?
Oil.
"Oh, oil."
Are you an honest man?
What kind of a question is that?
I don't see anything wrong with the question.
Did you make your way honestly?
Of course I did.
Isn't that the only way?
Is it?
"- Before you picked me, you didn't tell?"
- No.
- I always assumed...
- No.
Well... .
Let's go see our boss.
- Hey.
- How was the NGA?
"Oh, you know the governors, too many mandates, too little money."
- I can hear that one at home.
- Good one.
- The governors liked it.
- Yeah.
Have you announced for the governor of New Jersey bill?
- Excuse me?
- Did I miss an announcement?
That's three years away.
I'm trying to serve...
I never heard of these loans.
So I'm assuming it's a campaign proposal.
Camden and Newark will go nuts.
I know it's not national.
- Give me a break.
- Know how I know?
National programs are announced by the president unless this White House passes on them first.
"Toby, this is a nickel-and-dime program."
Calm down.
Right.
We're announcing a new replacement for Social Security...
- I thought we were...
- They're not your nickels.
- They're not your dimes!
They never take their eyes off it.
I heard your man telling you it was full of old documents.
"Well, that's not so."
"You see, a lot of documents is a lot of paper."
And paper's heavy.
But they lift that box as if it's as light as a feather... sir.
"Take him out, Tongue."
"- What's French for ""keep out"", Harris?"
"- Défense d'entrer, sir."
Right.
Come with me.
"Say a short prayer, Tongue."
Yea...
I say yea.
Yea.
COOPER French scots sir
About a mile back!
"Fall in, Rifles."
French sir
Ba
Why is that colonel chasing you?
He's chasing you
A full troop of French cavalry?
A full colonel?
"No, they're after you."
Why?
Because of what's in that chest
Why?
Because that chest is full of papers and the colonel is a great reader?
That's why?
I don't think you're escorting me
I think I'm escorting you amigos.
"At every step lies deceit, friends will stab you in the back"
"Oh, my room is downstairs"
"Leave, as soon as you can."
You have my consent
I'll send money.
- That won't be needed
"No, I will send money"
Anil Khanna.
I'm the principal in the college Jagadish goes to
I know.
We would like To see his room
The principal.
He wants to see Jagadish
What is the matter...?
- I don't know
Sir... you...?
We must check your computer
What is your password?
Why sir...?
He wants to know your password
Saraswati.
What...?
Saraswati.
Our mother's name
Our suspicion is true.
The papers were stolen by Jagadish's computer
Atul...
Did Jagadish use this computer to give you the question papers?
Why did you have to do this?
Someone tell me what he has done.
- I'll tell you Mrs Batra
Jagadish used his computer... just like a burglar who enters homes and steals
"Stop, you're tickling my ear"
Your cheek's all red
- Where would I get make-up?
- From Claire's.
"Later, I'll tell you a terrible secret about Charles"
"Ah yes, what secret?"
Go ask her to dance
I don't know how to dance
"Neither does she, go on"
I can't dance
I want to
"You dance terrific, like in the movies"
Is this what the priests teach you in school?
It's the last bottle
The Mayor wants a word.
He refused to go away
He can return tomorrow when Edward is here
He insists
I'll see him
Save a little champagne.
I shall surely be needing it
"Wait, I'm really thirsty"
That's the rhythm
84.
Want to dance?
She doesn't know how
Time to learn.
Shall we try?
I don't want to anymore
Just when I was getting good
That was the Mayor
He wants extravagant payment
- ...
I'm arresting you on suspicion
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!
"You do not have to say anything, but if you do not mention..."
Agh!
Help!
(SHRIEKS) Help!
What did I do?
Didn't find any drugs!
"Search me, I don't take drugs."
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?
- (MOBILE BUZZES)
- Can you shut up for one second?
- I'm clean!
I'm clean!
I'm clean!
- Justin.
Did you get a beat on that DNA?
"Er, yeah."
"Cameron Pell, artist."
"Well, failed artist."
A history of mental illness?
No.
The man's got serious issues.
Five years back he was arrested for gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.
"He's burst in wearing a clown mask, slashed a load of paintings with a flensing knife."
"When they tried to throw him out, he's gone completely Tonto."
Cut up two doormen.
Lucky to escape an attempted murder charge.
- Right.
You can remain seated.
"It is nothing, only a little exhaustion."
-Then?
-You are well.
"And that there is of the fatigue, lack of appetite and all that?"
"One does not worry, take this and you will feel better."
Good morning.
-What do you want?
-Sandro is in the house?
"-No, in fact, there is nobody."
"-In agreement, tell him that we will return."
"You hear, dear colleague, it would be better to wait for him here."
I do not know if they would have...
"Young lady, I am Prof. Moroni, educational of ""Endocrinoginecologentropia"","
-my assistant Dr. Ognissanti.
"-Yes, we are very important."
"-Come in, come in, please."
-Thanks.
Thanks.
Please.
"Sit down, professor."
Can I get you anything?
Whisky.
JB.
-What you want to do?
-You have seen that good she is?
"-Who, the chambermaid?"
"-Handsome, young, ingenuous, ebullient..."
-The lady is not.
-She is not...
-She does not know you...
-She does not know me...
"- I was just making the point, sir, that you've been screwing every girl in here with your eyes since we arrived, which suggests that sex ranks higher than substance."
"And I'll pass, thanks."
"You see, I don't really find intellectual thrust that sexy..."
"Or fake tan, for that matter."
"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?"
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.
"The thing is, I don't actually have to put up..."
OK.
Cool.
See you!
I think you should join her.
"Don't you, Tony?"
Toodle-oo.
You.
You really fucked up in there.
I really fucked up?
"Wait, what are you even doing here, anyway?"
Same thing you are.
Wow!
Check it out.
Ah...
Shall we?
No.
No way.
"First of all,"
I can't really swim very well any more and secondly...
"Ahh, boo-hoo."
What the fuck?
!
"I told you, I can't..."
I can't...
Goodbye.
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.
- She is weak... timid.
Narcissistically concerned with petty trivialities.
Unable to express her true self.
- And do you wish to return to your life as Isabel?
- No.
I have to forget I was ever such a vapid creature.
- Very good.
You are tabula rasa incarnate.
Do you understand the significance of what we've achieved?
"- Yes, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
- You are ready for your new identity.
"- Hello, good man."
"I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but is Mr. Baxter in?"
- No.
I'm sorry.
He's out.
"Was he expecting you, Mr..."
"- No, sir."
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.
- My apologies.
Perhaps you could call on him another time?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
"- My sweet, pretty wife."
"Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"
- More.
Your Faith doubts you.
- Then God bless you.
"You jerk, when dad comes home"
See if you can still live!
"No, I won't dare next time!"
Maybe I'll let you touch me and we can get even!
You deserve it
He teases you!
"Huh, does that amuse you?"
"Blockhead, I guess you need a good beating"
How dare you tease your brother?
Brother!
Big Brother
That blockhead didn't respect me
Don't you think he deserves a good beat?
Forget it and continue practicing
Otherwise Master will blame us when he returns
What are you looking at?
Want a good beat?
Gao Jian!
He pretends not to hear you!
Gao Jian!
What's the matter?
Bring me two stone weights!
You can get it yourself
"I'm your elder, you should do atleast obey"
"That's right, get it quick!"
What a chicken!
And he wants to learn martial arts
He is good in bed.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Quick!
"Gao Jian, kneel down!"
- Who'll know?
Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
"Oh, not you!"
Forget it.
- Squire?
What squire?
- You know what squire.
"Oh, my rheumatism."
That cell was so damp.
Two whole nights.
"Oh, you poor dear."
"Come, let me undress you and put you to bed."
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
"Oh, Betty."
Your hands are so soft and warm.
"You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?"
- Well...
- Do you?
"Come, let me take those off."
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
"Bernard, my darling."
Come.
Citizens nobles gentry!
The king.
Me?
"Oh, yes."
"Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour."
"And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate to meet it face to face in hand-to-hand combat."
Brother.
Grandma isn't there!
These...
They're Grandpa's clothes.
But why spread them out like this?
The clock in Grandma's head is running in reverse.
"So now, she is slipping back to the time of Grandpa."
Hello!
Yes?
"Just a little while ago, your Grandma came to my place."
Then... she saw the clouds and took off in a hurry.
She was headed for Nagasaki.
Today's clouds... look exactly like they did on that day.
Maybe she remembered what happened on that day.
"No, I mean, she thinks she's reliving that day."
Grandma!
Grandma!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field

AVON:
Tarrant!
Tarrant!
Listen...
Let's go.
- Tarrant!
Tarrant!
"- It's no use, he's cut off."
- Damn.
"- Well, that is it."
"With those ships out there, we can't wait."
They might not be looking for us.
Are you crazy?
You said yourself that was a search formation.
"They haven't picked up Tarrant, so why have they assumed a ship's out here?"
Just a minute.
"Orac, that message from Space Centre, how was it relayed here?"
Through Terminal 4006.
- The terminal on Helotrix.
"- Of course, Avon."
- That is the nearest terminal to our position.
- That's it.
They must have intercepted the transmission.
Computer logic.
The nearest terminal.
"So Orac's thick, we all know that."
Let's move!
- I'm going in under them.
- What?
We'll go down to cloud level.
"If we stay between them and the planet, we may not show up on their scanners."
Once we're below them we'll be cut off.
"Today, Supreme Allied headquarters reported American combat troops and aircraft have completely routed the attacking German army at the Ardennes front."
"American troops have discovered the frozen corpses of over 70 fellow GIs, taken prisoner then fiendishly executed by their German captors."
Investigating officers at the nightmarish scene say the massacre happened at a small crossroads near the Belgian town of Malmedy.
"General Eisenhower has vowed that upon war's end, all German officers and soldiers responsible for this unspeakable act will be vigorously tried for war crimes and swiftly punished."
"This is Armed Forces Radio, London."
"Ah, cigarettes."
What is this?
My wife.
You speak German?
Hmm.
Please...
Here.
Thanks.
Halt!
Halt!
Out!
Out!
Now!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I surrender!
"Get down, get down low."
Hello!
Is anyone home?
Come in.
It's cold in here.
Light the stove.
Ach!
It's foul.
Not like mom's house.
"Yeah, a little louder."
I do not ...
"As long as you practice hard, a year later"
You'll be another Jin Tianyun
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
Those gangs are still looking for you
As long as they didn't find my body
They will not give up
Sooner or later they will be here
"I know, you're afraid of involving me"
"Brother Jin, we're good brothers"
"We should share everything, be it joy or sorrow"
"Jian, nothing will last forever"
I'll come to see you a year later
"Okay, Brother Jin, by that time"
I'll take good care of you
You mean the rice of original taste?
"Daixiong, give it a try!"
-Me!
"-Y es, master"
Master!
Got it!
"Okay, okay!"
"Ying Chang, it's your turn!"
Me?
No way!
"3rd Brother, if you don't want to learn from dad"
You can leave here!
I didn't mean that!
Then go practice!
Alright!
"Master, which stance?"
As you wish
Whatever!
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
(GRUNTS)
(GUNSHOT)
(engine starting)
(EKG BEEPlNG)

"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
He is a murder
He has been punish
He just payed for his doing's
Father forgive brother please
Come father
The punishment I already got for my misdeed's
Please let the enemy between both family's end.
My enemy has to be dead
Did you understand
Don't spare him Kill him
Can change any colour but black will always remain black
Rughnath he is out of my reach.
And away from my life.
Shiv listen to me I only have 1 son.
And you go away'
In this village there is no place for you.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
"Okay, go."
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
"Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?"
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
"After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route."
"After reaching the outskirts,"
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
"Hit him then, and push him off the car."
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
tomorrow?
"No, it's today!"
Better call the station.
"Wait, stop!"
How will we explain this situation?
"If they find out about us, you may have to quit."
Word will spread quickly.
So only I suffer?
I guess your post is safe.
"It'll be bad for me, too."
But your wife's the daughter of the deputy director.
"You may have to get a divorce, too."
Fine.
Then you leave first.
I'll report this after you leave.
Look!
Someone was killed!
"Silly, she was just on her period."
So dark.
Apparently it was a murder.
Where?
The hotel next door.
It's a mess with police and ambulances.
Our customers can't come and go with all that tape.
"Suzuki San, could you man the front desk?"
Sure.
"Hey, you can't go in, stay back!"
"Okay, okay."
Looks awful.
Who was killed?
That streetwalker.
"A price dispute with a customer... led to the killing, apparently."
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.
Yeah.
"I mean, totally."
What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.
Cool.
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.
Whoa.
That...
That sounds crazy.
Can't wait!
I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net."
Hmm.
"Name could use a little work, I think."
It's all 90s.
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.
- Whoa!
- Are you ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Beam me up.
"Here we go, lock and load."
- Eyes closed.
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.
It's uploading.
"Five, four, three, two, one."
How are you feeling?
Um...
"still, I am content."
I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all.
You're an angel.
"Hands, halo, wings... everything."
"Good night, my dream."
"My poor lady, you are a wreck."
I am a resurrected wreck.

"- You know, my time is up on May 14."
- What of that?
"You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?"
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
"I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business."
- Married!
- Tea business!
"Why, you're mad if..."
"March to attention, everybody!"
"Let's march in in good style, men."
- Fall in up there.
"- Left, right, left."
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
"Yes, sir."
"Party, right wheel!"
Halt!
Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
"The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir."
"Eight killed, three wounded."
Otherwise all correct.
"Very well, Sergeant."
Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
"Very good, sir."
"Party, dismissed!"
"- Identical, Mitchell."
Thought you might know the right man.
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?

There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
No.
INTERVIEWER:
"So Lloyd, do you think that this body burn will"
"Be better than ""Terror Firmer""?"
You're up.
[Screaming]
--[sigh] Nothing could be that good.
[Laughs]
Nothing could be that unbelievable.
Not since the Vietnam Buddhist priest
Was there such a flame up.
INTERVIEWER:
So how do you guys do this?
How do you light him on fire?
Carefully.
[Interposing voices]
Come over here.
I'll show you where to do that.
"We have Nomex underwear, two pairs,"
In here soaking in fireproof gel.
[Church bells ringing]
This should be the soundtrack!
"Then we have a Nomex jumpsuit over here, which doubles"
For his janitor costume.
"We get that all on him, all gelled up,"
His face and hair gelled up.
Then we put on lighter fluid and rubber cement.
Light him on fire.
He runs around like a maniac.
And we extinguish him down here.
"Maybe you should practice it now, before he"
Gets the stuff on him.
My intuition?
Perhaps it's time you showed everyone what you are really like.
"Your feelings, your sense of humour and maybe even your flaws."
My flaws were already exposed by the media.
Nicolas the Humble?
Humbleness is an honourable trait.
Whatever they say.
Sire.
Did you manage to contact the Queen?
I couldn't get through to the palace.
- Prime Minister?
- He is not responding.
On purpose?
- We are ready.
"- Carlos, what is he doing here?"
- We are not going anywhere.
- Why is that?
The Security Service won't let us.
What again?
You have to find a solution.
We must get back home.
I'll try and reason with the Security Service.
Excuse me.
Maybe the Ambassador will be able to help us.
I'll go fetch the luggage.
"Sire, I will go and check if there is signal upstairs."
Where is the Ambassador?
- Sire.
- I can't concentrate.
The concourse...
Conc...
The concourse of cosmic and political circumstances...
I'm a huge fan.
He's downstairs.
Gareth watson?
Yes.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm karen.
"In fact, there was an expedition"
"Mounted by hadrian in 121 a.D.,"
But by the time his legions
"Got to salisbury plain,"
The druids had hidden them.
And no roman histories of gaul
Give the slightest hint whether or not
Any other evidence was ever found.
But...
"If there is a map,"
It'll be the most extraordinary find
Since they very rarely used parchment.
"You don't suppose it's on oak bark, do you?"
He's not due until 10:13.
How did your colleague
Come by this map anyway?
He isn't my colleague.
He's an agent of the gural nataz.
How are they involved?
"In 60 seconds,"
"A courier dressed in a blue trench coat,"
Carrying a titanium briefcase
Will step off the train
And step through those doors.
A car will meet him at the curb.
"- Yuck, Steso, why do you get those?"
- The pills are best when injected.
The physical and psychological agents are fluid.
"They add corn starch, parafin and calcium to solidify it."
- That's what gives you boils.
- You're gross!
- What are the dogs called?
- Chill and Ace.
- For chillum and acid?
- Right.
"- Very ingenious, Asger."
- Right.
- And yet so sad.
- Why?
- Are your dogs ill?
- I don't know.
Maybe it's the pig.
"They're in the bedroom or outside, till I've finished this."
"The dogs are used to the hash fumes, and suddenly you kick them out."
So they feel bad.
"Withdrawal symptoms, you know."
- What are you talking about?
- They're junkie dogs.
They are not junkie dogs!
They have a pedigree...
- Like you.
Your dogs are like you.
- I'm not a fucking junkie.
- You don't know what you are.
Stop it now!
- I have to go now.
- My dogs aren't junkie dogs!
Lay down on the operating table.
You are going to me to anaesthetise?
no?
One does not worry.
We already are.
In question?
Biliary vesicle.
You want to see the x-rays?
It does not matter.
"Once open, which does not go exempt it."
"A little while, it excuses..."
You quiet.
The patient does not have to speak.
It wants that to me it puts nervous and that it does a cut to him in zigzag?
So that the biliary vesicle.
You want to indicate to me where is?
Ah... here.
Wonderful.
Perforation of the stomach hemorrhage and in half an hour bushes to the patient.
congratulations.
Stupid!
idiot!
More above.
More above.
Cicchirini.
Moron I here to it say only.
"It seems to me right, Professor, nobody says ""idiot"" like you."
"Thanks, idiot."
Well?
we are going to find that vesicle or we postponed the operation for morning?
"Yet this mess, would be better."
-Quit!
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?
!
No.
Here.
Bye.
Deepa.
Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
"Thanks, doctor."
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
"Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease."
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
"- There's nothing to think about, doctor."
If Varun can get his sight back...
"Are we ready, Baron of Luxor?"
Everything is set.
It's enough to take out the entire mausoleum itself.
We just need to retile it now.
The time has finally come...
"Tonight, we will be freed from her spell!"
Her rule has been disastorous for the empire
Her desire for peace has held us back
Only domination and subordination exists between us and Terrans.
Coexistence is but a fantasy.
We must take back the future of our race.
Even if that means-
Who's there?
!
Run!
Those moves...
Are you one of us?
!
Seth-chan!
I'll be fine!
Just hurry and tell the Duchess of Kiev!
R-right!
Impertinent girl!
Will Seth-chan be all right?
"So long, girl."
Hurry to the port.
Make the final arrangements before pests arrive.
As you wish.
I know this will not remain forever
"However, it's beautiful"
"Your eyes, hands, and your warm smile"
They're my treasure
Why don't... you and I have a duel?
I will challenge you with my life!
You betray me for the sake of these workers
Have they been treating you well?
I know I owe you righteousness
I can only repay in my next life
But you owe them justice!
You have to repay it today!
Bullshit!
Let them all understand crystal clear
Who is... the master here!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
People!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
"If I die,"
none of you should take any action on my behalf
Think about your families
They are waiting for you at home
Fei
Can you win?
"If both sides get into a fight, there will be a lot of casualties"
It's better I die
Than to have the whole place drowned in blood
Promise me
"If I fall, you have to make them go home"
Let him in
Close the door!
You want to burn me to death?
-Did you turn a knob?
-Yes.
All.
It doesn't play.
It's only hissing.
Of course it doesn't play.
There aren't any parts there.
"And now we welcome in the studio professor Janatka, to introduce the popular series ""Mystical outer space""."
"Dear audience, recently there have been many groundless reports about the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations on our planet."
From a scientifical point of view this is shear nonsense because...
"Hey, doctor!"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"-That was a great explosion, Doctor."
-You gave us a real treat.
Congratulations!
At night some people are falling into a strange kind of unconsciousness.
-Shall we try it too?
"-Well, since we are here..."
-Are you already unconscious?
-Not yet.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
Let's repeat after him.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
"Mum, mummy, Please not noodles!"
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Noodles... no.
"Let's use the word ""alleged."""
They got photos!
They got witnesses!
"They got the ""alleged"" slut..."
Hey!
Let me tell you something.
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.
"- Will, calm down."
"- You better get used to it, Will."
Especially when not even your wife will defend herself.
"Give me something, Laine."
Anything.
"Hell, just deny it."
Why don't you just deny it?
It is simply beneath my dignity.
Dignity!
Right.
We'll just have to make this all not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.
What have you got on the distinguished gentleman from Illinois?
Some pretty good stuff.
"- S.E.C. Investigation, 1985."
- You got stocks?
I want something embarrassing!
Something sexual!
"Little boys, midgets, that sort of thing."
- Cows!
I don't give a goddamn!
"- Come on, Kermit."
"If we do that, we're no better than he is."
We are no better than he is.
There's nothing there.
"Look, he ate a coin."
- A coin?
Yup.
An incident with the kebab.
Border!
Hurry.
Finga being a woman.
"As the border guard approached, I was all in sweat."
"I imagined someone imprisoning me, he would take off my clothes"
And confiscate the camera.
"It's already done, you know."
"Fortunately, our clandestine escape coincided with another story."
"Sorry, Nicolas, but we're in a crisis of identity."
Crisis?
- We do not agree with anything.
Anything.
Anything.
"The old generation wants tradition, we merge."
"In Istanbul, we had to appear on television"
For the first time after so many years.
Stupid storm.
But Mr. Lloyd will make a music video.
"Yes, I hope so."
The first shot was just to have fun.
Maybe they just had to clear their minds.
The real canton for the video is a cosmic classic.
"Then, Mr. Lloyd, his flight plan ends so?"
Miss?
- Ana.
"Ana, yes."
Can you give us some information on transport?
Yes.
¡Owen‎!
Owen‎!
Come here‎.
I'm all ears‎.
Another time‎.
Let's load these trucks and move‎.
Agreed‎.
Welcome gentlemen to express Owens‎.
Watch your head‎.
"Our next stop‎, hot baths‎, beds and good food‎."
‎
- Good Morning‎. ‎
- Where did you get that‎?
Lo Tome por AHI‎.
I had to make something for my brother and thus prove I was here‎.
You know I'll never let you take it home‎.
Never say Never‎.
Did you find more treasure‎?
Behind the graves‎.
They excarvaron and left all these things before you leave here‎.
Speaking of treasures ‎.‎.‎.
"I have some novels you love‎, but want your cigarillos‎."
Here they are‎.
Are you serious‎?
Is that a fair exchange‎?
"No smoke‎, but read‎."
What is the problem‎?
Have you heard of the robbery on the highway‎?
All that crap you have a package worth just there‎.
These are hard to find‎.
All right‎.
What will I do with cigarettes‎?
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.

"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
I use it for exercises
Clementine...
I've come to a decision
I'm leaving with you.
It's all decided
If you agree
"I'll write my mother when we're there, explaining my decision"
When we arrive... where?
Wherever you're going
I packed a suitcase.
I'll be ready.
You'll see
I'll manage all the details
I'm sure you will
"Please, don't joke."
I can't stand it
I'll never cause you any problem
I'm the one who would cause you problems
I'm sick... finished
"Yes, I mean it."
I'm flat broke
Poverty doesn't scare me
You know what it is?
An empty stable is poverty to you or a dress you wear for two seasons.
The real thing you don't know
"Here, look"
Quite a group
Is that you there?
It's you
It was.
"Where he went, women used to adore him"
But he died penniless
"I may not always be truthful with anna,"
But I am always honest.
"Difficult balance, that."
One that I imagine you know all too well.
Here we are.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far
With a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
"Well, she looks to have seen better days."
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.
Do you have another one of those?
Someone's getting very confident.
Hmm.
Bingo.
Careful.
Some can be skittish.
Very well aware of that.
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
The constrictor causes
Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction.
"Bones break, I'm afraid."
It was originally designed for back massage.
Hmm.
Right.
Let's call it in.
"Miss carter, I'm not sure you've thought this through."
I can't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find.
I'm not suggesting...
And here we go.
We loosen our arms And up and down and up and...
Sir.
Excuse me.
"Import, export."
Let's go.
Mr. Vanyerka?
-Doctor Yansky?
-Yes.
What would you like?
You're not going to invite us in?
Of course.
Please.
You were chosen by the biggest computer in the galaxy to be the representative of the planet.
Congratulations.
We came to accumulate objective systematical information.
About the conditions on Earth.
This is a confidential mission.
You understand?
"Calm down, please."
Part of our project is to be inconspicuous.
"But if you really arrived from outer space, you would look completely different."
Like what?
For example like green elves or something like that.
We don't like doing this.
Every change of appearance exhausts us.
Doesn't it?
Then we must rest for a long time.
Now do you believe us?
"Excuse me, but why me?"
Why only me?
How can I be beneficial to you?
It warns you're a dangerous man
I stole a loaf of bread
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law
I know the meaning of those 19 years
A slave of the law!
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
"Yes, 24601"
My name is Jean Valjean!
And I'm Javert!
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me 24601
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
You'll always be a slave
"Look down, look down"
You're standing in your grave
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(PANTING)
(SINGING) Freedom at last How strange the taste
"Never forget the years, the waste"
Nor forgive them for what they've done
They are the guilty Everyone
The day begins And now let's see
What this new world Will do for me
Can I help?
A day's work?
OVERSEER:
Papers.
"You know, between us he spent his time annoy others."
Look at the comments of his former comrades.
Everyone is happy.
His death brings them satisfaction.
"""Master Sakotaaaa"""
"""Finally dead."""
"""He not deserve to live."""
Yesterday one person died .
Yet there is more people satisfied
"The head of murdering a taxi driver this morning and the theft of her recipe before taking flight from the video of the taxi, it would be the former inmate"
"Otoharada Kuro, 46 ."
The address he gave to his release is false.
It took a notice research to find him.
Done.
He resurfaced Otoharada.
Now I count on you to find him.
Then...
Yagami.
Do not disappoint me.
Yes.
- Return to your quarters!
- Yes.
"Chief, this time..."
"Refer to the jurisdiction, and will investigate."
We must give them every detail.
Yes.
Course.
This Ogiso a big head.
"Yeah, but wait."
The head endures same.
The leader knows the suspect Otoharada?
You not know?
Please keep that in mind
Yes... sorry
Don't sit there
I forbid you from being in my sight
"Excuse me, but..."
Why did you choose such a nice room?
Are you asking me?
Yes
Um...
Were you showing off or something?
That wasn't my intent
Satsuki said she liked this room
"Yep, I like it"
"Sorry, it's just me showing off"
It's not Satsuki's fault
"Mr. Aida, you're so nice"
You think so?
Bebi!
Do you grasp the situation you are in?
I wanted to be your friend but this is horrible
Sorry...
You betrayed us
You said you would come right out
Sorry
Appologizing doesn't solve anything
She is my close friend
"You understood the situation, right?"
"Lin, stop it"
Yelling at Bebi doesn't solve anything
Unless it's going to lead you guys to bed
Lin topping and Mr. Aida bottoming
That's so kinky
-Not noodles.
Why me?
Why only me?
Why only me?
Why only...
What is it?
-A soft-boiled egg.
-It has a great shape.
"A civilization that can produce such a perfect thing,"
- is a very advanced civilization.
"-This is not produced,"
-hens lay these.
-Hens?
-Yes.
Tell them we congratulate them.
"Excuse me, but according to the program we have an opinion poll."
Do you want help?
You're not going to eat?
"No, don't worry."
We have our own methods.
Good afternoon.
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
I would kick them in the arse!
"Look, I'm not intrerested in politics."
"At work I'm doing my job, I adorn windows."
I want my own peace.
Good afternoon.How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Pidlivization?
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial pidlivization?
Civilization.
It depends on where they came from.
Good afternoon.
"No, Mr. Scott."
Neither you nor I can be spared here.
"Mr. DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear."
"Mr.Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there."
Dr. McCoy will accompany.
"If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question."
Dismissed.
"[ Uhura ] No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked onto their original source."
Very good.
Transmit coordinates to Mr. Scott.
"Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately."
Use the laser beacon if necessary.
"Ready, Scott?"
"Ready, Mr. Spock."
Activate.
"Where are your storms,Jaeger?"
Atmosphere... exactly the same as ours.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
DeSalle to Enterprise.
DeSalle to Enterprise.
It doesn't function.
We're cut off.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
No response.
Keep trying with yours.
[ Beacon Whistles ]
Something's blocking the beacon.
Got to find open ground.
Jaeger!
McCoy!
"In the name of heaven, where are we?"
Look.
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.
"""No voice divine the storm allayed."
"No light propitious shone."""
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Mamma...
Look.
This has just arrived.
"""I should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon..."""
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No.
I will fetch her.
"Wait, let us delay."
I believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.
It would be cruel to take her away so soon.
Devonshire is so far.
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable?
But...?
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate.
His reading...
Elinor has not your feelings.
Can he love her?
Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet.
Miyu wouldn't hurt anybody
You're using that as an excuse for violence?
That is horrible
That is a crime
You don't know anything do you?
What?
She was a prostitute
For over six months
It's total bullshit
Fucking bullshit
I told her to quit many times
She totally ignored me
She even said she quit
But just changed shops
It's worse than just being unfaithful
"She had no right to bitch, even when I hit her"
Thanks to her I may have HIV
Now that shit is a crime
What the fuck man?
It's getting to my head
That's a lie
It's not a fucking lie
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown
What if I have it?
My life would be ruined
That's a lie
It's not a fucking lie
She got me infected
"You said ""maybe"" earlier"
A different STD.
Clamydia
Clamydia heightens the chance of HIV
Anything I desire eh?
We'll come later
We just wanted to stop by
Good bye
What's he doing here?
"I'll find out right away, your Majesty"
"Whatever he is here for, I don't want to see him here again"
Aye aye
Why are you here?
Paşa your Lordship
I came here to see princess
When wil she be released?
Whenever his Majesty wants
Maybe ever
But my Paşa...
It is very serious.
There would be a big conflict
Let it happen
Then we would see how serious it is
Additionally
Don't come here ever again
"If you want to say something, visit me"
What is this?
"Mumbar Dolması, Stuffed sheep sausages"
Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness
Our Sultan is here
How are you today Signora Isabella?
Translate exactly what she said
I'm happy as never before
How couldn't I be?
I'm away from my palace and family
I'm captured by the barbarians
It's heavily reinforced.
It's pressurising.
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
After you.
REED:
"A little stale, but breathable."
Bio-signs... very faint.
REED:
Coming from in here.
[Solemn instrumental music]
Some kind of shuttlecraft?
ARCHER:
More like an assault vehicle.
"I'm reading a half-dozen particle-cannons, torpedo launchers."
[Radio beeps]
Archer.
"TRIP: [On radio] You'd better get over here, sir."
T'POL:
The DNA is identical to the bodies we found.
They would appear to be the crew's offspring.
A hatchery?
They built this place to take quite a beating.
"Reinforced bulkheads, backup power systems."
Thirty-one eggs are still viable.
They won't survive for long.
Their bio-support is losing power.
Do you think you can repair it?
I wouldn't even know where to start.
"There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay, get it back to the ship."
I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
"Aye, sir."
ARCHER:
You look lovely when you're angry.
Stop it!
I'll love you... if you want.
"Oh, yeah?"
But don't boss me around.
I don't want to boss you around.
"Then love me for a change, and stop annoying me."
Then love me for a change.
Sometimes you're so...
"Oh, no!"
Why did you go to that movie?
"Well, I think we're even now."
Bye.
I've finished work.
Nervous... arrogant... vain... unkempt... unhealthy... self-satisfied... full of longing... spent...
- strange.
- Full of longing?
- That annoys you.
"- No, arrogant annoys me."
- And self-satisfied and vain.
- Yeah.
It's your turn.
Reserved... frustrated... inhibited... hesitant... closed-up... pulled together... egocentric... not hungry.
You don't want anything to eat?

Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
If I knew now
What I knew then
I'd run from these blues-soaked hills
And I'd go back to the well
And chew her white lipstick
"And her long, slow kisses"
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
I'll tell the keeper
Bring us something else to smoke
While we're naked and alone
So they make us immortal
So they make us a deal
Will it matter when we're naked and alone?
Such a beauty with a smile
There'll be opportunity
And abundance for all
But if I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
I can see it in your eyes
No more had oaths
Only a ray of light on the wall
When I wake up from our sleep
To a bright new sunny day
I no longer miss the shadow
I want to touch the air
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum in my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love

Who said you could walk around like that?
- Like what?
- Come back here.
Why would I do that?
With every shake A lucky break
- Provin' that there's a way
- A way
- To chase your cares away
- Away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
- Shakin' the blues away
"- Away, away"
- Unhappy news away
"- Away, away"
"If you were blue, it's easy to"
Shake off your cares and troubles
Tellin' the blues to go
They may refuse to go
But as a rule they'll go If you'll shake 'em away
Do like the voodoos do
Listen to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so To and fro
With every shake A lucky break
- Provin' that there's a way
- A way
- To chase your cares away
- Away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Shake those blues away
Gotta chase those cares away
Just to prove that there's a way
"A way to shake, shake your blues"

DDT!
"Bring sir""s luggage from the jeep.. shekhar, listen!"
"I can""t stay with you."
I have come on government duty.
I will have to stay at the government guest house.

"(Roberto, her son) Mom, I need to use the car, remember?"
"Pardon me, this is my son Roberto and his friend Julio."
"These ladies come from San Antonio, they are going to Hotel San Diego."
Why don't you take them to their hotel?
"No problem, Mrs...Toledo and Ms. Toledo."
We're named Toledo too!
True!
"Is this the last name of everyone here, Toledo?"
"All, no."
But it's a very common name here.
I'm not named Toledo.
"I'm Julio Lovero, at your service (pleased to meet you)."

Why did she come here? she came to apologise!
- Apologise?
And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.
lf she had got it for me.. then why did she give it to you?
"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"
"ln the afternoon, bedroom!"
"At night, bedroom!"
Always bedroom!
I am fed up of this place!
"Let""s go home, shekhar!"
Please!
Are you really fed up?

Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."

"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
So you know our guys are looking forward to it.
It's an opportunity to play at home.
And to home course call it advantage if you want to but were looking forward to playing them at home.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Anything else you like to add?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Just that you know there's no admission to come and watch the golf team play.

"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."

He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.

"""You are my dream-boy."
"You are my love."""
"""You are my Hero..."""
This is a cheating.
It's partiality.
And father they dig 3 feet deep pits in my ways.
And they made total confusion on finishing line.
"You must have seen, father."
"Don't get disheartened, my child."
I've told Pundit to fix a date for your marriage with Radha.
Father!
You are God!
You are a great man.
And I'm a thief!
"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."

I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.

"Well, it was easy for me, one my friends works in an office and was able to give me tickets"
"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"

Sometimes I think Jas and I are the only normal people here.
There's Dave the Laugh.

"Let's not start the term with a detention, Nicolson."
"Our headmistress, Slim, likes to oppress me,"
'cause I caught her once with her skirt in her knickers.

"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much

"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."

And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.

Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?
"- Abla, you are being over optimistic.- Come on, please."
Don't we all know Meltem?
What are you talking about Hilmiye...
"Tell me, didn't we know our own kids?"
Nothing surprises me anymore.
- Nothing...- Selim will be devastated if he learns about it.
- Don't tell him anything about it.- Of course we can't say such a thing to him.
Shall we change the music?
"- It's my turn now.- Floor is yours, abi."
"- Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?- She's there."
Thank you.
"Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?"
Give me it.
- From him?- Give me that.
What is it?
"Abla, give it to me."
"""I'll send you my best wishes."
"At exactly 10 p.m."""
"""All together, to many happy years."

"Hurray, hurray!Dad look!"
It's amazing!
"Kerim Abi, is this your present then?"
Hey stop!Stop!
Fatmagül.
Don't cry.
My birthday has been ruined as well.
Is this how it's gonna be?Will my happiness always be left unfinished?
"Don't let it demoralize you, Fatmagül."
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.

Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?

"No, Prince Yuning."

- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.

Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
This is Dayton Way in Beverly Hills.
It's actually a very expensive town.
"I don't fit in very well, do l?"
&amp;lt;'Bear' Yong Guk's shoot begins&amp;gt;
The background saved me.
It's like L.A.
It looks fantastic.
Feels like L.A. here.
Pictures come out beautifully here.
Nature is definitely better than creating expensive sets.
No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.
okay.
Great job.
"Now, it's Zelo's turn."
The first scene is a wrap.
Zelo will now be shooting a skateboarding scene.
Zelo will film something similar to me.
Directors are so good at filming.
They're making us look very attractive.
We look as though we're Korean-Americans living in America.
I'm pretending this iPod is an iPhone.
"Woah there, wind."
None
I'm doomed.
My face is bloated.
I can feel my face all swollen.
I'm screwed.
I think that's a person over there.
Look at him wash the baby like she's laundry.
(Born in Busan) I've been to Gwang-an-ri Beach in Busan.
"Hae-woon-dae, and Song-do beach."
But I've never been to such a huge beach like this before.
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box

"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."

Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Welcome to Tea Time.
(whispering) I have something really important to tell you.
(whispering) So come close.
(whispering) Closer.
(whispering) Closer ... (whispering) Ok!
(whispering) Today.
Is.
My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, always stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .
I can tell with the others as well.
"Uh, I missed the update, so you do have essential training in teacher twelve, not four, this came out the,"
"February, the fifteenth."
Yeah.
"So I do, I did have not."
All right.
And we.
"Yeah, I just realized that, I'll have to go back take a look at that again."
"And we have um, finished shooting, um."
"Uh, course the shooting with the Nikon D800."
So that will come out in November.
"Oh, November."
"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So you can spend your um, your holidays."
Watching movies.
Okay.
Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
"In North Africa, smaller fly than here."
"And Turkey, smaller fly than here."
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
Dal-rae...
Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.
"So why don't start? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;When he was young Ji-hwan was often ignored.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's now a rascal but then a quiet kid who'd fight a lot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so other kids avoided him a lot.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As your teacher, I want to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more about my loving students.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Did you see them?
The drawings all over.
You have runny nose.
"Here, wipe it off."
"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.
It's not coming out...
Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."
AB:
What year would you like?
CA:
1824.
AB:
"1824, OK."
AB:
And what month?
CA:
June.
AB:
June what?

Sixth.
AB:
Was that a Sunday?
CA:
It was.
AB:
And it was cloudy.
(Laughter)
"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
"We'll transfer youhere in the morning,is rapidly recovering."
Nurse...
Have you been hereall night?
I am.
"Dida beautiful lady come to visit me tall, black hair,in a black coat?"
"You've had many visitors,I was busy and did notpay any attention towho enters and exits."

"news... news son,you have visitors"
"Come on, pick up. pick up."
"Well, well, brother"
Thank God you're all right...
How are you?
"I'm fine,Azmi, thanks."
God saved!
"A quick recoveryMahir, good luck,"
Speedy recovery.
We're very worried.
"Thank Godthat heard the prayers! thanks brother,Do you need something?"
Just say.
"No, my friends,Thank you."
How long will youstay in the hospital
"I do not know what the doctors say,But today's my father s hearing"
And I havebe there as a witness.
"How are you going to go,Mahir?"
I have to ..
I have to go and join my fatherat the hearing to set him free .
Good morning.
"the court hearings is today, right?"
Why are you so nervous...
You'll see Mahirand his family .. surely I have been informed about it...
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him ..
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him...
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.
It must have been precious to you.
"No, it's alright."
"It was used to save lives, so I'm sure its owner would have been glad too."
But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.
Come on!
Fine.
Do it.
Then do it.
Okay.
"A long time ago, I was going up this mountain..."
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.

Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
"Peter, tell us about yourself."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
"Well, shouldn't you know?"
"I mean, who would know?"
Leave him alone.
Maybe is a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside... ...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But is hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
"I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy."
"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
Thas right.
I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
"Yes, you do."
I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
"But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry."
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie...
Brightest green were all her garments...
And her hair was like the sunshine...
Day by day he gazed upon her...
Rent!
Where is my money?!
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
Loooook!
These are our wedding pictures.
"You are the groom, I am the bride."
Whole Guzelyurt was there.
Everybody admired the gold jewellery given to me.
They said this land had not seen such a beautiful bride for years...
"Yes, take a good look at me."
Do you remember you hit me?
I wanted you to give me a present to see my unveiled face...
And you hit me in the face.
Mustafa Bulut...You are something...
You can't run away like this...
You will remember each one of them...
And then you will answer to me.
I won't forgive you unless you kiss ten times every part of my body you hit.
Welcome... and good bye.
Visiting time is over.
"Today, there were too many people coming and going."
"Mustafa brother, it is time for your medication."
You are loved by beautiful women.
One comes while the other leaves.
Mustafa...
"Where are you going, son?"
Mustafa...
Please look at me.
Son...
My child...
"Hug your father once, eh?"
Hug your father...
Mustafa held the sling and you should have seen it...
Everybody in the garden dispersed.
But he had already set his eyes on someone.
What sort of parents do you think we are?
- Do you really want me to answer that?
"- That's enough, missy."
- Why would we damage you?
- We made you.
"Honestly, Georgia, this attitude is..."
Welcome to the tragic universe that is my sad life.
Why?
I'll give you five major reasons why.
"Number one, my parents are from the Stone Age."
"- No us, no you."
- God knows what you'd do.
- You understand?
You wouldn't exist.
- Yeah.
"Number two, they hate me having a life 'cause theirs are practically over and mine's just starting."
- And it's not good enough.
- Honestly.
Every year it's...
- Number three. ...a performance...
My little sister's bonkers.
Poor Angus will need even more therapy than me.
- A lot of trouble! ...because of your fifteenth birthday...
- Number four... ...it's not good enough. - ... my nose is the size of Jupiter. ...so ungrateful.
- I need to go into an ugly home.
"- Georgia, what have you gone and done now?"
How did you manage to pluck them all so quickly?
"You haven't, have you?"
"Oh, crikey."
"Bob, she shaved them."
"Number five, I'll never get a boyfriend."
What's the hurry with growing up so fast?
"Oh, Gary McDonough."
His mother just died when he was in Florida.
He retired from GM and he was down there.
They're all pretty much retired.
"Caroline, she married a real nice guy"
He started off as a mechanic for the school district of the county just south of
Travers City.
He was running it years and years ago.
He was the head guy running the - he knew stuff.
He knew engines.
Nice guy.
So that worked out.
But now they spend their summers over there someplace.
They get back here once in a while.
They have something in Florida.
So the whole bunch is pretty good.
Sally's got this...
Nice girl.
She could ice skate.
She was a good ice skater.
Did the fancy stuff.
We skated out one time
I think it was [?] and Gary and myself.
February.
"And like one of them two week old ice, where it froze yay thick."
We went out after school and it was cold.
Where?
Out in the - just ice skating out towards Grey's Reef
The harbor?
Towards [?].
"And we got out there and - beautiful, just"
"like shotguns going off, when the ice cracks, when it's freezing, you know."
Kona Ranga Rao becomes crores Ranga Rao.
I am placing my daughter in your hands.. ..you should make her a star and change my fate.
Do you have a five star cigarette?
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.
"Yes, my difficulties have become a joke for you."
Tell as what they are.
There are two matches.
One girl is very beautiful.
She likes me too.
But she does not have any money.
The other girl is average in looks.
But she is very wealthy
What is there in money?
You are lucky to find a girl who likes you.
Marry that girl who is not rich and you will be happy.
You are what I call a friend.
Now tell me the address of that which girl.
Give me water!
Someone close to you is remembering you.
Why do they remember even when they are close?
"Because they are close, they will remember.. ..either when close by or when far away."
Is that so?
"Hey, these people are getting very close."
It is better that we go away.
"Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!"
Oh!
My father!
Where is your father?
There.
Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?
She's of use to me.
Come here.
Go catch her.
Go!
Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.
- But how will I climb a mountain?
"ln my eyes, you are greatness"
"I'm here, I'm here with you"
Don't stay... don't stay with me...fight!
I'm not leaving you!
I'll be waiting for you in the next life
I see nothing but you!
I'll never be further from you than this!
Antony!
Queen Cleopatra!
Come out
Yield yourself to me!
Open this door!
ls she alive?
I don't know
Get the battering ram!
Caesar...
"So, Antony has gone to join Caesar"
"No, he's here with me"
Take the riches of Egypt Then let me die properly
I have no desire for you to die
"I've conquered a great country, a great Queen"
It's my wish that you accompany me to Rome
So you can walk me behind your chariots...you Egyptian prize?
Octavius' trophy?
"That would do, yes"

I am a goddess!
I am immortal!
"Ah yes, the Daughter of lsis"
You and I are very much alike
"Compelled to follow our own natures, fulfill our destinies"
"But I have won, Cleopatra And you will come to Rome!"
- It's okay.
- Cemre and Zeynep are also waiting downstairs.
They didn't let them inside either.
They're waiting at the door.
Cemre came here to make an appearance?
What business does she even have here?
Her husband is the one who  made them put you in here.
"Handan Hanım, let us not talk about things we don't know."
- They sent you letters.
- You brought them with you?
They will control them first.
Then you will have the letters.
Cemre also sent you some food and drinks.
"And Zeynep, some clothes."
We have only 15 minutes.
And we'll spend that talking about Cemre and Zeynep?
"Okay, don't start arguing again."
So?
"Is there any problems, anything bothering you here?"
"No, why would anything bother me?"
Thank God...
- It is fine.
- Stay away from the bad lot.
"Yes, son, you won't spend much time here."
Just make sure you don't get in trouble.
Just close your eyes and ears.
Don't let it happen like the last time.
"Okay, don't worry."
It's not the first time I end up here.
- I talk to your lawyer everyday.
"- Me too, son."
I call him everyday.
This will give some time to make Bandaid sale the stick and give me all the credits.

"If this is the guild's will, Omega Zell will join you."
And you'll have my thief skills.
"Yes, my thief skills will certainly come handy."
"I'll get this staff one way or another and thanks to it,"
I'll finally get in the Justice guild in exchange of this one of a kind item.
Let it be.
We will be the fellowship of the staff.

I said that she would be no longer where you look at  and you would see only me.
"Look, I am here now."

The way we can square on most calculators --
"let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square."
"On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster."
"What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method."
"What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,"
I will try and race you to the answer.
OK?

I don't like any!
How boorish coming to a motel and talking about painters.
I went get drinks and even condoms.
You're angry.
I understand.
But you know what?
It'll be better to do it when we really want to do it.
I really want to do it
Then let's do it when we really really want to do it.
It wouldn't be hard doing it with you.
But the fantasy will be broken.
What fantasy?
Of a good friend!
A friend I can really talk to.
We talked for six months.
I don't think I've ever been happier.
Do you know what the worst kind of woman is?
Who acts like she's going to put out but doesn't.
Do you really want to do it?
Yes
"Then, do it with your mouth."
Maybe later.
When we want to do it.
Then.. do it with your hand.
Let's do it later.
I'll do it later for sure.
You can't even do it with your hand?
Oh my god.
Weren't you going to buy some mackerel?
No.
We have a lot of fish.
Have some.
"Do you have any idea, how many people from this town he took under his wings and gave jobs to?"
And Selim...
His father-in-law is a parliament member.
Now why would a reputable and popular family like that want to ruin all their reputation?
Why would they get involved in an incident like this?
It makes no sense!
It's absurd.
"Besides, Selim got engaged the night of that incident."
"He spent the whole night with us until he joined his fiancée, and..."
Don't make me talk more...
"That's why, you better listen to me and accept that ""everything happens for a reason""."
Forget about what happened...
Forget about Fatmagül.
Hey dad.
"Okay, I am on my way."
"OK, I'll be there."

Stay out of trouble son.
"Good day, Mr. Prosecutor."
It's Lawyer Munir Telci.
Sorry to bother you this time of day.
Are you in your office?
"Yes, I'll visit you to make a complaint."
"Yes, did you see the local newspaper?"
"Yeah, don't ask."
Yes.
I'll be there soon.
Just leaving home.
"OK, thank you."
See you soon.

- Do you think you got rid of Burak?
Is this how you thought of getting rid of him?
Shame on you.
Where did these come from?
What are these?
You wanted to kill Burak.
"God damn you, Barış."
You lied to me all along.
Where did they come from?
"Who gave you these, mom?"
A courier left them at the door.
God damn it.
We're going home.
The murderer has been found.
Put an end to this tension.
I think the killer is still out there among us.
- What does this mean?
- Burak hired that man.
"This way, not only he cleared his name from the accusations... ... but also, he can still claim that he's the victim."
- Why would he do that?
- That man absolutely hates us.
He wants to have us on a string.
But I won't take that.
I won't let that happen.
Don't rise yourself to the bait then.
"Either way, Burak will be in your life."
I am not very sure about that.
- I need to hang up.
- Is Ebru Hanım in her room?
"- She won't be here today, sir."
- Why?
I wasn't told the reason.
Eh?

They are giving you ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy).
Very gently...
You should have seen the electric shocks that I was given...
You couldn't stand it even while watching.
This is nothing...
For seven years...
I was given electric shock.
They fried us with electricity in Diyarbakir prison.
I smelled the burning of my own flesh.
"They made us into human kabobs, Mustafa..."
And then what?
Don't you be afraid.
You don't die from electricity.
You die from loneliness.
You die if you are not loved...
"How did you get the rich Mustafa, eh?"
"Do you get a good tip, eh?"
Serve him well...
This is a whale family...
"Let's stay away from this piece of shit, Mustafa..."
"Yesterday, I was looking at old pictures..."
"Look what I found, Asil."
Look what Mustafa did.
"The world will never see another man like Musto, dude..."
I pushed him around the garden in his wheelchair for about an hour.
"Now, he is yours."
I'll go and check the tea house.

Yes.
I will have you thrown out of this house.
I know Indira very well now.
I will get an emergency declared on you.

"Scoundrels, watch now."
Just watch.
What are you doing?
Now you'll know how my son is.
Oh.. no.
He and my dad.. so this is how he is.
You threw a balloon at my father.
"My delicate, innocent and.."
Stop praising me.
And give them a reply.

What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?
Exactly...

Yes.
Yes.
"So, I'm thinking over it and you too must think All of us must think over it."
After all it's a question of our prestige.
What if they elope and do register marriage?
Then?
Then?
And what if they'll really commit suicide?
Then?
Tell them to commit suicide and you too do the same.
God!
Nephew?
- What?
Who...
"What nonsense is this, Damodar?"
"It's not nonsense, uncle."
It's a fact.
"Look, uncle."
It's difficult for me to speak the truth... ...and for you to hear it.
That's why I had to do this drama.
But it's true that Radha and that boy are really in love.
"Damodar, have you seen the boy?"
"Yes, of course."
Instead I know him.
I know him very well.
"Aunt, if we won't accept Radha's proposal... ...we may repent in future."
Damodar!
- Why will Damodar lie to us?
Boy is studying medicine in America.
But it's a lie
Not to them
So tell them the truth
If it helps you lie.
Janelle are you getiing any of this?
Me too.
I'm just testing you
"Look, sir."
All you gotta do is go back out there tell them you actually slept with Janelle and it pops### their whole balloon. it's over.
"I can't do that, Mike."
I didn't sleep with Janelle.
I'm gonna sully### her good name just to save my political hide###.
Sully.
Janelle bagged the mayor of the city.
"Am I right, janelle?"
Give me some
We'll work on it
Why are we stopping here?
I thought we were going to lunch
Bennet.
We need to talk
"Yo, carter, I thought we agreed we wasn't gonna it's all right."
These are my friends.
So they know about us
"Oh, my god, it's a gay boxer"
Bennet. lightheavy
I had you pegged for cruiser.
"That's a good idea Stuart, taunt the professional ass kicker"
I'm not afraid of him.
I used to box in college
You're way out of your league
Does anybody else smell that?
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
Hi Victoria.
Did you work here at Western illinois University or somewhere else?
Victoria:
"I worked at Iowa State University, and I worked for the plant-introduction station at Iowa State University."
Beth Seaton:
"And this was on his US Department of Agriculture grant, correct?"
Victoria:
"Yes, it was."
Beth Seaton:
"So were you working with pennycress, too?"
Or were you working with a different crop?
[Text on screen:
"Victoria, student intern]:"
I was working with a bio-soil plant called camelina.
"And I was basically taking the diomorphic differences, which is the difference in the leaf shapes, and the morphologic measurements of camelina."
Beth Seaton:
Tell me about your internship.
What would you say was the most exciting part of it for you?
Victoria:
I got to work a little outside of my major.
I'm a biology major and chemistry.
And I'm focused more on the animal aspect.
"But I got to work more with the plant aspect of it, and I really enjoyed it."
Beth Seaton:
Hi Josh.
Josh:
Hello.
Beth Seaton:
Tell me a
little bit about your internship that you had with Dr. Phippen's
USDA grant this summer.
Josh:
"Evenin' sirs, welcome to SPACE hooters!"
The finest in tit related eatin' and drinkin' this side of the galaxy.
Can I start you boys off with somethin'?
Maybe a Tatooine Titty Twister or a Dagobah Dirt Bomb?
Just the bottle service.
Bottle service coming right up!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think it's just early.
What?
The guests are Jedi?
I know trouble when I sees it.
Believe you me these boys is covered in it.
We're screwed!
You know the Jedi reputation.
"Listen, we have to get them out of here."
Peacefully.
How are we going to do that?
"I mean, we can't just kick them out."
"Whatever you do, do not piss these guys off."
Is it normal to make us wait this long?
Relax!
I'd like to try their hot wings.
I'm actually hungry.
"You boys expectin' ladies, or is this just a sausage festival?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a sausage festival.
Say sausage one more time.
Sausage.
Let me guess.
The Jedi were perfect gentlemen... ...paid their bill in full... ...and left with no fuss.
No!
They skip out on their bill!
They steal from the cash register!
Are you all sure?
"I'll book it if you promise never to chant ""Bahamas"" again."

"All right, thank you."

"Block of rooms, garden view."
"Wait a second, garden view?"
That's the opposite of ocean view
"Hey, foxy lady want to come back to my garden view room"
I asked for the garden
The nose from### the ocean keep me up at night
So what the noise from my foxy lady if I had an ocean view room
"Stacey, any chance the national's media picked up on this story with the media"
I gotta go.
"The mayor pulled an ""Uncle Louie"" last night."
Nothing national but did you see the headline in the post
His honor was on her.
Very clever
"Jason's### really killing us, sorry Mike"
Doesn't matter.
It's under control.
I got Jason coming over### here right now
Jason is coming up here?
Damn I hate this tie
Carter
Great tie
"Listen, Jason, about this story in the morning paper"
"I thought it was great, by the way"
You didn't think it was too wordy?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You're so talented...

This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language:
Divorce.
Divorce.
How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
"That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone."
"Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:"
Because what if God isn't real?
"I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?"
"And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:"
"And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave."
"Life is so freakin' short, you know?"

Welcome to The Love Parade.
"Wow, it is gone."
What is this?
I missed the opportunity.
Is she that beautiful?
Who may be the blessed person that gave birth to.. ..such a beauty?!
She is from the abode of the gods.
Give me 2 liters.
Wait for 5 minutes.
We are in important discussion.
You came without knowing the name or address of the girl?
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?
What will you do here without those details?
That is the issue I am unable to solve.
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.
Why do you discourage him like that?
Encourage him.
Look here my dear Salim - My name is Venkat.
No.
If you are searching for your Anarkali then you are Salim.
You look so dynamic.
Why are you.. ..listening to this burnt out fellow?
Thats it.
"Look here, dont be depressed that you missed her."
Search!
- There is nothing you cannot find if you search.
"Who are you sir, giving advice freely?"
"Ranga Rao, a big name in the states."
I came here now.
I am planning to settle down in Warangal.
Thinking to settle in Warangal?
Bla bla bla
You see this?
It says 'Marital status':
'Never married' and the part I highlighted - I should have highlighted - the part next to it:
"'Surviving Spouse's Name, if wife give maiden name'"
'Surviving Spouse's Name' is blank
"Because in this country, gay couple's are not legally recognized."
Gay love is not recognized as love.
And we are therefore not treated as equal human beings to heterosexual human beings
Now look here.
I am on this though.
"Number, box 22a of the Florida Certificate of Death."
'Informant's Name':

'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember"
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
You have neither fighting skill nor wisdom.
You don't even have courage to fight.
Just go and hide yourself like you normally do.
Granny!
Show me how to make a pouch.
- I'll make one for you.
- No.
I want to make it myself.
I want to embroider something on it too.
What will be good?
A flower?
A bird would be better.
I should be able to make it in two weeks?
- Did you arrange to meet him then?
- Yes.
I think it'll be the last time.
"If I make a pouch for him, will he cherish it?"
I suppose this is crossing the boundary too.
It's really been a while!
"Here, have another drink."
I really respect you!
I will accept that opinion!
I should have recognized you when you called me Doe Eyes the first time!
But you tricked me by saying Goggle Eyes instead!
"So you were fooled by that, right?"
I was a bit surprised at my quick wit too.
"Farewell, Doe Eyes!"
"Farewell, Goggle Eyes!"
It's similar!
You're really smart!
"At least you understand me, Doe Eyes!"
I really respect you!
"I called the coiffure, the girls said you weren't there all day."
I can tell something happened.
Nothing happened Cemre.
I just got a bit emotional.
I can see that.
"But I am asking ""why""."
Well...
I don't know.
It thought about how small... ... how short life is.
It is like a blink of an eye.
"I mean, one can be so determined and work too much for something... ... and then one day it all goes away."
"I mean, as if it never existed."
As if it was a big lie.
"Cemre, life is full of lies."
Every life ends the same way... ... which makes everything meaningless.
Wish I knew what makes you say all this.
I was just thinking about all these stuff... ... they got me emotional.
But really Cemre... ... we have just one life.
"One must live for herself, not for others."
One must only regret what they couldn't do.
That's how it is.
My dear...
Don't regret anything.
"Forget about others, you fight for the one you love."
Be happy with whom you love.
"Yes, sweetie..."
You love Kuzey?
Go grab his hand.
You two suffered so much.
Cemre...
You deserve to be together.
My dear...
How dare you stare at my brother?!
For this criminal?
Criminal?!
"Not he, you all are criminals... ...who are stopping him from being a good person."
You are forcing him to be evil.
Go and make him good as you want.
Go away... go... get lost.
You are dead for us. you are dead.
"Yes, go away with him."
No one will stop you.
"Yes, I'll go away."
Right now.
"Let's go, Kishna."
"No, Radha."
I'll not take you away in this way.
Mother!
"Mother, if I wanted to elope with Radha I'd have done that 2 years before."
But now I'll take her away with respect and self-esteem.
Self-esteem!
Cultured people are self-esteemed... ...not some dirty blood.
Because I recognize dirty blood as goons.
Father!
"I'm sorry, I respected you."
You are not even worth for this respect.
Because my parents were poor... ...but they were very rich by hearts.
They knew to respect their guest even if he's their enemy.
"Kishan, I beg of you."
"Please, go away."
Go away!
- I'm going.
But he has blamed my blood by accusing my parents.
I'll never step in this house again.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
"My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?"
"My wife passed away, my children's mother."
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
"We have no electricity, no water, no drains."
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.

The procedure would kill her?
"No, the surgeon would."

Is she going to die?

You wouldn't be writing about mortality.
And then so.
Right.
You don't have to say that.
"I mean, things that are sort of obvious, don't say it."
"Just say the important limitations of your study, the important strengths."
"And, you don't have to label them as strengths and limit."

I'm reviewing papers.
Yeah.
Where you can tell that a.
Somebody had taken the thesis.
Yeah.
And just tried to turn it into a paper.
It's a very different product.
Right.
"So paying attention to the, the actually writing like a paper."
Right.
He says it's a great tip.
Mm-hm.
And lets talk a little bit about resubmission.
So lets say that you're offered the opportunity.
"The, the paper's rejected but."
Mm-hm.
You're offered the opportunity to resubmit it with a lot of comments from reviewers.
Mm-hm.
"- No, Your Honor."
- Very well.
"Excuse me, Your Honor... ...but the jury would like to make a recommendation... ...regarding the sentence."
- Objection.
"Sit down, counselor."
"It's only a recommendation, and I would like to hear it."

Have you seen the news?
"There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man... ...right next to you."
Just like James Van Hopper.
"All right, I'll say it."
I was wrong.
But I'm ready to make it right.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Will you be able to return to your parish?
I can't go back.
Not now.
Once you've looked into the darkness... ...I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
What about you?
I believe you've seen the darkness too.
I don't know.
I will come with you to Rome
But I want something in return
"Anything, I can be very generous"
Let my son rule Egypt
"Not for the moment, no"
Then let me give Antony an Egyptian burial
"Here, in this place"
"Then I will come to you as the Queen of Egypt, bowing to the might of Rome"
Very well
I'll need time to prepare
And the emblems of my office?
"Of course, you can have them I have no use for them"
I have what I want
Make sure she doesn't harm herself
"Wait for me, Antony"
I won't be long
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
"Why weren't you here to protect me, Rufio?"
"I regret that it was not possible, Your Majesty"
We need to be alone to pray
Away from Roman eyes
I'm afraid I can't allow that
You should know our ways by now
Don't you trust me?
I've trusted you all these years
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!
"Open the doors, Your Majesty!"
Open them now... or I'll have to break them down!
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
A man who no longer believes in himself?
Stand up!
Stand up and fight!
Be a man!
You want me to be a man?
"Yes...Antony, look at me!"
Look at me!
We'll fight!
"You may tell your Queen, Rufio, that I've received her tokens of submission and am most grateful"
As to the request to spare her son
I can not answer that for the moment
Why are you still loyal to her?
Has she enchanted you as well?
I'm under orders from Caesar...
Caesar is dead!
I am Caesar now
You could be my ears in Alexandria
"Very well, then"
"Tell her that, before I can accept her offer,"
I would require some gesture of sincerity...
tell her to deliver to me... the head of Marc Antony
You may go...
Provide Octavius with what he requires and you'll find him most grateful
No
You must
"Your Majesty, in the name of lsis, please, do not forsake your country, your own child"
Not for love
It would be like stabbing my own heart
Better Antony than Egypt
Better that than your own son's life!
Take the knife
I want to share something with you
[Bleep].
I got it.
I've got it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Fire.
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We've got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
[Bleep].
So it doesn't...
I've got it.
I've got it.
[Bleep].

Like a knight in shining armor.

- Yeah.
Yeah.
Brilliant. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Very brave.
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Okay.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You set the place on fire.
"- No, it's not funny."
"- You're right, you're right."
"Trust me, you've got your neck in a noose."
Be careful. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's crazy.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's just the lack of experience. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're seeing a lot of people&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;who didn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to do trying to do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a little bit of everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Yeah. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 60 seconds to go. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Finishing touches&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to those plates,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;clean those plates&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;beautifully.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ten, nine,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;eight, seven, six,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; five, four, three, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;two,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; one, and stop."
Whoo!

Joy:
"Because if you were having sex with yourself, one more question: that would mean that you have sexual feelings."
See?
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
David:
"Well, the thing is...okay."
"The important thing is, at least as far as thinking about my life-"
"If you are going to have a sexual relationship with someone,"
Joy:
Yeah.
David:
That's a lot of energy you have to spend into thinking about that
like thinking about that relationship.
Joy:
"So, what are you just lazt or what?"
[laughter]
David:
"Well, I still form relationships."
Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everyone else.
"So, I still have to think about forming relationships."
I just don't have to think about forming relationships sexually.
I have to think about how am I going to start a relationship without something else?
How am I going to form intimacy in a way that isn't based on sexuality?
Star:
Help me with this.
Because what you seem to be describing is more of a choice.
Than an orientation.
"Intially, I thought you were describing an orientation."
David:
"No, I am describing an orientation."
Star:
"""And I learned this:"""
"""When somepony offers to do you a favor..."""
"""...like making you a beautiful dress..."""
"""...you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you."""
"""In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth."""
"Rarity, my congratulations."
You are the most impressive fashion maven.
Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture... ...in my best of the best boutique in Canterlot?
"Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday."

"Fine, I won't take it up."
"But as medical students, we want to know."
Okay...
That is Sanjay Singhania.
Hit on the head with an iron rod.
"After the incident, he lost his memory."
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.
He remembers events for only about 15 minutes.
Afterwards... he forgets everything.
"For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it."
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.
"Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings..."
lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind.
How does he go about his everyday routine?
How does a child perform instructed tasks?
"By committing to memory, learning by rote."
"Or, by jotting things down in writing."
"Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing."
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?
"This, no one knows."
"Unfortunately, he doesn't even recall a face."
How can someone live on like this...
It's the perfect color and so hip
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
Making sure the cloth's correctly facing
I'm stitching Twilight's dress
"Yard by yard, fussing on the details"
Jewel neckline Don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
Make her something perfect to inspire
Even though she hates formal attire
Gotta mind those intimate details
Even though she's more concerned with sales
It's Applejack's new dress
Dressmaking's easy For Pinkie Pie something pink
Fluttershy something breezy
Blend color and form...
Do you think it looks cheesy?
"Something brash, perhaps quite fetching"
Hook and eye Couldn't you just simply die?
Making sure it fits forelock and crest
Don't forget some magic in the dress
Even though it rides high on the flank
Rainbow won't look like a tank
I'm stitching Rainbow's dress
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Thread by thread, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, never stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
That's it.
Keep them closed.
Don't look.

formula_1
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
Example.
"An example would be to use the number 5. ""σ"" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every ""σ"" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number."
History.
"Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than ""N"" is proportional to log2 ""N""."
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
"The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,"
"but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,"
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
"Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969."
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated. As the protocol does not require these frames to be encrypted, an attacker can simply send such a command to deconnect a device. The attacker only needs to know the MAC address of the victim. This address is sent unencrypted with each frame."

Fixed-gear bicycle
"A fixed-gear bicycle (also called a ""fixie"") is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism (allowing pedals to stay still while moving)."
It is a dangerous bike to use in towns. This type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world.
"Fixed-gear bicycles are very light. They are built without any unnecessary gadgets, such as chain rings or freewheel hub. When a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle, he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike."
"Most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill. Fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel. That means that the rider cannot stop pedaling. When the rear wheel turns, the pedals turn in the same direction. This allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals, so that the mechanism will not rotate."
"It also makes it possible to ride backwards, although learning to do so is much more difficult than riding forwards."

The incarnation is a basic teaching of Christianity. It is based on the New Testament of the Holy Bible. The incarnation is the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second person of the triune God; took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God. In the Bible its teaching is in the Gospel of John, where in chapter 1 verse 14 (abbreviated as “John 1:14”), it says “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,”"
"To Clarify, the holy trinity is made up of 3 divine persons'. The Father God, the Son, Jesus and the Holy spirit. The Holy Spirit is described in many situations, but the most commonly known one is the tongues of fire that rest upon Jesus' 12 disciples' heads and it empowers them to speak different languages and preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. His teachings and way of life allow us to find peace and harmony and help others in need. By doing as he taught us, we can become better people and show God's love through us mortal beings."
"In the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both ""truly God and truly man"". The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation, which is better known as the Annunciation."
"This is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and most Protestants. Other views on the subject have been considered in the past, but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies."
"In recent past, another doctrine known as ""Oneness"" has gained credit amongst Pentecostal groups (see below), but has been rejected by other Christians."

This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases."
"And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes."

Phenol
"Phenol is the organic compound with formula C6H5OH. It is a white solid. It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol.

It is also used in detergents and herbicides."
Properties.
Acidity.
"Phenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion."
Reactions.

History.
"Phenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis. They used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people."

Scuttled by PBS.
"The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision ""robbed a national public television audience"" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power."
Critics.
"B.J. Bullert, in his book ""Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film"" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying ""It's more difficult to say (""Dark Circle"") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism""."
Point of view.
"The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."

The Flory convention.
"In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates."

Simple Network Management Protocol
"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite. SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects."
"SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc."
Overview and basic concepts.
"In common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an ""agent"" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems."
"SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as ""free memory"", ""system name"", ""number of running processes"", ""default route""). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration."
"The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."

Eight other delegates who didn't announce who they'd vote for, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well."

Conspiracy (criminal)
"Under criminal law, conspiracy is agreeing between two or more people to commit a crime sometime in the future."
"Examples of conspiracy include conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to kidnap or conspiracy to commit murder."
Suzerainty (American accent: soo-zer-en-tee) happens when a country X has its own government but cannot act independently because of a more powerful country Y. This more powerful country Y is called the suzerain and can usually control the foreign relations of X (how X interacts with other countries).
It differs from sovereignty in that the tributary still has limited control of its own stuff and internal country affairs.
A suzerain can also mean a feudal lord. Vassals must pay tribute to the feudal lord.
Some examples.
The term suzerainty originally described the relationship between the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding regions including:
"China historically had suzerainty over Mongolia, Korea."

Second-class citizen
"A second-class citizen is a person who is discriminated by their country, even though they are a citizen or legal resident."
"Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians."
British Rail Class 499
British Rail allocated Class 499 to a fleet of six luggage vans used in electric multiple unit formations on boat train services between London and Dover. They were allocated Southern Region class TLV (meaning Trailer Luggage Van).
British Rail Class 501
The British Rail Class 501 electric multiple units were built in 1957/58 for use on the former LNWR/LMS suburban electric network of the London Midland Region. A total of 57 three-car units were built.
British Rail Class 502
"The British Rail Class 502 was a type of electric multiple unit originally built by the London Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works workshop. Introduced in 1940 and withdrawn by 1980, they spent the whole of their working lives on the electrified railway lines of north Liverpool."
British Rail Class 503
"British Rail Class 503 trains were 70mph (110km/h) electric multiple units. They were introduced in two batches — in 1938 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with a further batch (built to a similar design) in 1956 by the then nationalised British Railways (BR)."

Eric Nickulas
"Eric Nickulas (born March 25, 1975 in Hyannis, Massachusetts) is an American professional ice hockey right winger who last played for the ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Nickulas has also played a total of 7 seasons in the NHL; 4 with the Boston Bruins, 2 with the St. Louis Blues and 1 with the Chicago Blackhawks. He won the Calder Cup in 1998 while he was apart of the Boston Bruins farm team, the Providence Bruins."
Halteres
"Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better."
"The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings."
Function.
"Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight."
"They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight."
"Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres."
"The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres."
Development.
"In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene ""Ultrabithorax"" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype."
Convergent evolution.
"The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the ""forewings"" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the ""hindwings"" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution."
"Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and ""in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight""."
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
It probably comes from where you are.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that it probably does.
Most
"I, I'm not sure"
"but,"
"When I drive through that area, that's all I see is  pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards."
Yeah.
"It's nothing but woods up here, down here."
Yeah.
"I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't,"
"I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually."
"And, but that was just when I was a kid"
so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.
"But it's, I don't know, we're a college town"
so that doesn't help us out any.
Right.
East Texas.
"We have,"
"gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon,"
so that's probably about what you're paying
Huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that"
so.
Yeah.
That's a lot easier.
You've got something going all the time.
"Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?"
"Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,"
"It's just,"
Yeah.
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,"
"the opposition will say this, this and this and"
Uh-huh.
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is,"
Yep
it's pretty amazing.
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore."
"It's,"
"Yeah,"
it's not.
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because."
Yep.
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious"
and he really gets into suing people.
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv"
"but,"
"But, uh,"
Yeah
"but it's for the more general,"
people don't want to take responsibility.
Yeah.
"You know, it's,"
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh  and stuff."
Yep
"See, you're from California,"
is that right?
"Uh, yeah."
Well originally from Chicago
"but,"
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
"well, we, we've had, uh,"
"let's see,"
"we had, uh, we had a, uh,"
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
"and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story"
"Uh, and we had a sixty-five"
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
"So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really."
"Yeah,"
we've been real pleased with ours.
"I think we've had, one, two, three"
Yeah.
"and most,"
"we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven."
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"but I don't know,"
"we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year"
"and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, I don't know what we're going to buy."
"I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,"
"but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty"
Well
"So,"
more because of their personalities than their sportsman
Uh-huh.
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
"so you know, the competitor,"
and I became involved in following his career.
Right
"And, uh, I know that, that my husband,"
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.
Oh.
And he thought he was spectacular.
"I said, Whoa."
"I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him."
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition
Uh-huh.
"Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,"
and I followed Andy Bean.
Uh-huh
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
"Oh, he's interesting."
He is.
I like to watch him.
"He is a character not just a golfer,"
Yeah.

Yeah.

Uh-huh.
I'm a nurse
"and I work,"
Oh
I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
"and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that."
"To, to compensate for some of the benefits."
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
Yes.
And then I have my freedom.
I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
"Well, that, that's an excellent,"
"so actually that is a benefit, uh,"

anything can be warped.
Yeah.
"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely."

Something to stay active at for a long time.
"Uh-huh,"

"Yeah,"

"That's right,"

"The History of German football is one that has seen many changes. Football was a popular game from early on, and the German sports landscape was dotted with hundreds of local sides. Local sports associations or clubs are a longtime feature of the culture of German athletics. Each club would participate in, and field teams from, one or more sports, depending on local interest and resources."
"Prior to the formation of the Bundesliga, German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of sub-regional leagues (until 1945) which, in post-war times, had a top layer of semi-professional regional Oberligen (""Premier Leagues""). Regional champions and, from 1925 onwards, runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) was founded in Leipzig with 86 member clubs. From the start, the DFB was – and still is – a federation of regional associations. The first recognised national championship team was VfB Leipzig, who beat DFC Prague 7–2 in a game played in Altona on 31 May 1903."

On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

"John Jude Palencar (born 1957) is an American fantasy, science fiction, and horror artist. Over 100 book covers have featured his art, including all four covers of ""The Inheritance Cycle"" series by Christopher Paolini. He graduated from the Columbus College of Art and Design in 1980. He is married to Lee Palencar, who works for Highland Local Schools as a middle school art teacher."
"Palencar has exhibited in numerous group shows in galleries, colleges and universities throughout the United States. Demand for his work extends into Europe and the Pacific rim through sales of his original paintings, second-rights usages and commissions."
"He was a featured artist for ""IDEA Magazine"" in Japan. Many private and corporate collections throughout the United States and Europe include his paintings. Palencar has created covers for several novels by Stephen King, who also holds Palencar's work in his private collection."
"When Knopf published ""Eragon"" in 2003, they called on Palencar to illustrate the cover. He also illustrated the covers for ""Eldest"", ""Brisingr"", and ""Inheritance"". Paolini said that he named Palancar Valley after him long before Palencar illustrated the cover of Eragon."

= = = Belmont railway station (Harrow) = = =
"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."
The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.

= = = Slice knot = = =
A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot.
"In knot theory, a ""knot"" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere"
and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."
Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice.
An old question of Fox asks whether every slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.
The signature of a slice knot is zero.
The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product formula_24 where formula_25 is some integral Laurent polynomial. This is known as the Fox–Milnor condition.

Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).
On 13 March 2018 he was named assistant coach of Croatian team Dinamo Zagreb in staff of manager Nikola Jurčević.

"England and Ireland began the competition in early February, England comprehensively defeating their visitors 7–0 in Sheffield and taking the initial tournament lead. Scotland joined them with a strong victory over Ireland in their first game, but England again seized the top slot with their own defeat of Wales. In their final match, Ireland succeeded in achieving their first ever international victory with a 4–1 win over Wales in Belfast, to put them in third position. England and Scotland then played a deciding match in Blackburn, Scotland only just running out 3–2 winners after a very tough game.

= = = Dusty Fletcher = = =
"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."
"Fletcher continued to perform the routine, particularly at the Apollo Theatre in New York, until shortly before his death."

He joined the service as an infantryman and spent 2003 - 2004 in Iraq, assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. In his book he expresses a great deal of enthusiasm about the benefits of wheels over traditional treaded armor in urban settings."
"It was in Iraq that Buzzell began publishing a blog under the title ""CBFTW"", ""Colby Buzzel Fuck The War"", as a replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, because as an anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, and he was also able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to."
"Buzzell's blog gained recognition for its realistic portrayal of gripping first hand accounts of the war in Iraq. This 'milblog' won praise as “an unfiltered, often ferocious expression of his boots-on-the-ground view of the Iraq war"""
"Colby published a book on his experiences entitled, """" combining narrative, blog entries, and emails that evolved from his blog over time. The book received good reviews and has been recommended for public libraries."

"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."

"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."

Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"".

Olivia FitzRoy was one of five sisters."
"The family spent their summers in Scotland, the setting of her books. They were there in 1939 when her father, a naval officer, decided that they should remain in Inverewe for the duration of World War II. The area was remote; FitzRoy wrote her first book, ""Orders to Poach"" (which told the story of the Stewart children receiving unusual instructions from their overseas father) to entertain her two younger sisters, Barbara (now Ormrod) and the late Amelia (now Jessel). It was published by Collins, as Billy Collins was a friend of the family. The second, ""Steer by the Stars"" and the third ""The House in the Hills"", were based in the same location."
"FitzRoy carried on writing when she began service in the Women's Royal Naval Service, though she was stationed as far away as Ceylon. After the war, she travelled with the 'Chipperfield Circus', which was the inspiration behind ""Wagons and Horses""; she then went back to live in Scotland."
Olivia FitzRoy married Sir Geoffrey Bates in 1957 and they had two daughters. She died aged only 48 of cancer in 1969.

= = = Biosphere reserves in Singapore = = =
"The Singaporean government has established some five biosphere reserves in Singapore. There are namely: Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Chek Jawa, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
"One of the first notions of biosphere reserves in Singapore was thought up by the then-Singapore Botanical Gardens Supritendent N. C. Cantley who, in 1882, proposed that select areas of land be preserved. In as early as 1883, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (as it is now known) was established, making it the inaugural biosphere reserve in Singapore. The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate. His nephew, Lloyd Goldman, is also a notable real-estate investor in New York City. His children, Allan Goldman and Jane Goldman manage the remaining real estate assets amounting to $6.0B via the firm Solil Management."

OB 293 was a North Atlantic convoy which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
"It was notable for seeing the loss to the Kriegsmarine (KM) of , with her commander KL Günther Prien, the person responsible for the sinking of two years previously."
"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"Joseph H. ""Cyclone"" Miller (September 24, 1859 – October 13, 1916) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He played just two seasons in the majors, but did play with four teams in three leagues. He stood at 5'9""."
"Miller's major league career began in 1884 for the Chicago Browns/Pittsburgh Stogies of the Union Association. He lasted just one start, in which he threw a complete game victory, allowing only two runs. He then moved on to the Providence Grays, filling in the rotation due to injuries to their top pitchers, Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. Even though he did pitch well for long stretches during the games, he struggled to secure the victories in the late innings and had to be replaced. On July 31, 1884, in a road game versus the New York Gothams, he was appointed umpire due to the scheduled umpire calling in sick. The New York fans thought his calls were decidedly one-sided toward his Grays team, and he had to have a police escort off the field after the game. The game ended in a 3-3 tie."
"On one occasion, with Miller playing right field, the manager had wanted Sweeney to switch from pitcher to right field to bring in Miller to pitch in the 9th inning. Sweeney refused the move and walked off the field, and because of the rules during that time, Miller had to pitch the game with only two outfielders. He went on to lose the game, and Sweeney was suspended for a game to violating the manager's order. Instead of serving the suspension, Sweeney quit the team and joined the St. Louis Maroons of Union Association, leaving Radbourn to shoulder the team's pitching duties for the rest of the season. It was that season that Radbourn set his all-time record for wins with 60, which under today's rules would have only been 59 because in one game, he relieved Miller with Providence having the lead after five innings. On September 13, when the team departing on a lengthy road trip, they decided not to bring Miller along with them, thus ending his short tenure with the team. He compiled a 3–2 record with them in five starts and one relief appearance that resulted in a late-inning loss."
"He is also on record as having pitched one game for the Philadelphia Quakers during the 1884 season. In that game, he pitched a complete game loss, giving up 19 runs, 10 of them earned."
"Miller spent 1885 in the minor leagues. He started 1886 with Macon of the Southern Association but finished it with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He went 10-8 that season, completing all of his starts and throwing one shutout. On August 20, he threw a one-hitter, giving up his one hit in the ninth inning and losing 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, and their young fireballer Matt Kilroy. During this season, he played one game at third base, becoming one of only 36 left-handed players to have played at least one game at that position."

"The Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, commonly referred to as the Pittsburgh Marathon, is an annual marathon footrace held on the first Sunday in May in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984 with U.S. Steel and PNC Bank as sponsors. From 1985 to 2003, the race was held annually and named the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon, although serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race."
"The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course."
"Aside from the main marathon event, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a half marathon, two to five person marathon relay, 5k race, and ""kids marathon."" All races except for the ""kids marathon"" and 5k utilize the same route and starting time as the marathon. Attendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race. Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants distributed in the 5K. Additionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance. 2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5k selling out on or before March 6, 2012."
"Historically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh's at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either Downtown or North Shore. Previous finish lines have included Point State Park, David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and the 50 yard-line of Heinz Field. The current finish line is on the Boulevard of the Allies near Point State Park. Numerous other historic and well-known Pittsburgh neighborhoods are along the route, including the South Side, Oakland, Shadyside, East Liberty, Highland Park, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, and the Strip District."
"Throughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations. Neighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route. Sixty bands, almost all of which are from the Greater Pittsburgh area, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres."
"The Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for men in 2000 and the US Olympic Trials for women in 1988. In addition, it has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s."

"Also in 1981, William Bennett, head of the band Whitehouse and the British Come Org. label, offered Bianchi a record contract, which Bianchi signed unchecked. It was based on a ""joke contract"" that Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound had sketched. The contract assumed all rights to Bianchi's work. After delivery of the tapes Bennett edited-in speeches by Nazi leaders, and instead of the relatively unsensational name MB, it was published under the alias ""Leibstandarte SS MB"", named after the SS unit that worked as bodyguards to Adolf Hitler."
"By 1983 and the release of the ""Plain Truth"" LP on U.K. power electronics label Broken Flag, Bianchi had become a Jehovah's Witness. At the end of 1983 Bianchi announced his withdrawal from music, stating ""The end is very near, and we have a very short time to recognise our mistakes and to redeem ourselves...

= = = Fadeaway = = =
"A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block."
"The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound."
"The shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender."
"Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook."

"The growth of Hamilton's economic landscape during the late 19th and early 20th century is accredited to textile production, the city's second largest industry, second only to the steel mills. The men responsible for this city's economic expansion are the ""5 Johns"" of Hamilton (John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, John Sutherland, John Dickenson and John Patterson). The men opened the ""Catract Power Company"" in 1896 which brought cheap electricity to the city. They were Hamilton's major landowners in the region, both of which brought manufactures and entrepreneurs from all over North America."
"The general manager of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck industry in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the ""5 Johns"" to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company"" ""was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860–1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats."
"The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers."
"The Cotton Factory has always been a ""people first"" kind of place.

The acquittal, went largely unnoticed until September 1979, when professors Upendra Baxi, Raghunath Kelkar and Sarkar of Delhi University and Vasudha Dhagamwar of Pune, wrote an open letter to the Supreme Court, protesting the concept of consent in the judgment. ""Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."" Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, ""Forum Against Rape"", widespread protests followed and eventually Indian Penal Code was amended."
"In 1980, she became a founder member of Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), Delhi, founded by Vina Mazumdar, and which went on to become an influential institution, impacting the course of women's studies in India.

The trains were turned around so riders would view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so riders could see them."
Rolling Thunder was standing but not operating in September and October 2005 and through most of the Spring of 2006 due to the construction of the Plaza del Carnival section and El Toro.
"Rolling Thunder closed on September 8, 2013, to make room for . Soon after Rolling Thunder closed, it was demolished, except for one part of the track which is still standing."
"The line for the ride began at an adjoining entrance and had separate queues for each track. The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height would ride Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement."
"Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced."
"The structure and track was mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas Fir. In the past, the Douglas Fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine."
"The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides."
"Using the Batavia Institute as the basis for its proposal, Batavia submitted a bid for the Illinois normal school in 1857. A normal school or teachers college is an educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The State of Illinois passed an act to establish a normal school on 18 February 1857—the second west of the Appalachian Mountains."
"Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857. The first proposition on the agenda was from Batavia, which offered a subscription of $15,000, with the land and building belonging to the Batavia Institute, valued at $30,000, making $45,000 in all. Washington, in Tazewell County, Bloomington, and Peoria submitted proposals, as well. After considerable discussion, a resolution was adopted locating the new university at Bloomington—actually north of town at the village of North Bloomington, which was renamed Normal in 1865, for the school. Illinois State University celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007."
"The building and grounds of the Batavia Institute were sold in 1867 to Dr. Richard J. Patterson, who, as proprietor and medical superintendent, operated it as a private rest home and sanitarium for women, called Bellevue Place. The sanitarium operated until July 1965. The most notable patient was Mary Todd Lincoln, widow of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was a patient for several months in the summer of 1875."
"In the 1960s, the building was converted to a residential facility for unwed mothers called the Fox Hill Home. The Fox Hill Home operated into the 1970s when the building fell into disrepair."
"In the middle of the 1980s, the building was once again named Bellevue Place and converted into apartments."
The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Place on 13 August 1976.

"Spatz is a children's comedy series that ran on Children's ITV during the 1990s, produced by Thames Television and created by Andrew Bethell. The show originally ran from 21 February 1990 to 10 April 1992. The show centred on a fast food restaurant situated in a fictional shopping mall in Cricklewood, London. It was operated by two Canadians, Karen Hansson (Jennifer Calvert), Spatz International's European Co-ordinator, and Thomas ""TJ"" Strickland ( Paul Michael ), the restaurant's manager. Vas Blackwood, Stephanie Charles, Jonathan Copestake, Sue Devaney, Joe Greco, Katy Murphy, Ling Tai and Samantha Womack appeared as Spatz restaurant employees. Guest stars included David Harewood, Rhys Ifans, Gary Lineker, Danny John-Jules and Nicholas Parsons."
"""Spatz"" was devised by Andrew Bethell as a drama for teenagers set in a 1930s themed burger bar, so named because spats might have been worn there. Alan Horrox at Thames Television bought the concept and title and passed them to Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman, already established at Thames Television as the writers of ""T-Bag"" and creators of ""Mike and Angelo"", to develop ""Spatz"" as a sitcom. While updating the setting to a standard fast food restaurant, the name ""Spatz"" was retained, with the writers noting that it suggested spats or disagreements."
"Series 1 of ""Spatz"" was a co-production between Thames Television and Canada's YTV. From Series 2 onwards, ""Spatz"" was produced solely by Thames Television."
"On 6 January 2013, an episode of ""Spatz"" from 1992 (""Tango"", the third episode of Series 3) was repeated on CITV as part of its 30th anniversary."

"In 1919, after a trip to the United States, he designed and began the production of the “Électricar”, a lightweight, three-wheeled, one-person electric automobile. Only 250 units are sold; the market demanded an internal combustion engine. At the same time, he relaunched his horological business, producing primarily alarm clocks and timers. In 1925 that business was bankrupt, and closed down."

"The report Environmental Risks and Challenges of Anthropogenic Metals Flows and Cycles was the third of six scientific assessments on global metals to be published by the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the United Nations Environment Programme. The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:"
"Metals and their compounds have been used for millennia because of their unique properties. They are used in highly valued products of modern technology, furthermore, they plan an essential role in renewable energy technologies. After having analyzed issues of metal stocks in society and recycling rates and recycling conditions and opportunities in the previous two reports on metals, Metal Stocks in Society report and Recycling Rates of Metals report, the International Resource Panel decides to address the environmental and energy issues related to the use and the production of metals. In this report, an assessment is made of literature on metal flows and cycles in nature and in society, the way they are connected, and the potential impacted related to them. The four areas of focus are 1) Local impacts of mining, 2) life cycle energy use, 3) non-metal sources, and 4) the need for a final sink. Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development."
"The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores."

At the local level, most cities and many villages have municipal police forces, park district police forces, and even local specialized police forces. Many colleges also have their own campus police that are often sworn police officers."
"In 2000, Illinois was ranked 4th in the U.S. in the number of full-time sworn officers with 321 per 100,000 persons, behind Louisiana (415), New York (384), and New Jersey (345). In this ranking, only New York had a higher total population than Illinois. Illinois is also near the top of most law enforcement numbers lists, such as number of agencies per state, number of agencies with special jurisdictions, and number of local police agencies.

= = = Nanosheet = = =
A nanosheet is a two-dimensional nanostructure with thickness in a scale ranging from 1 to 100 nm.
"A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest two-dimensional material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices."
Silicon nanosheets are being used to prototype future generations of small (5 nm) transistors.
Carbon nanosheets (from hemp) may be an alternative to graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors.
"The most commonly used nanosheet synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir–Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations can be used to prove the experimental process."
"Ultrathin single-crystal PbS (lead sulfur) sheets with micro scale in x-, y- dimensions can be obtained using a hot colloidal synthesis method. Compounds with linear chloroalkanes like 1,2-dichloroethane containing chlorine were used during the formation of PbS sheets. PbS ultrathin sheets probably resulted from the oriented attachment of the PbS nanoparticles in a two-dimensional fashion. The highly reactive facets were preferentially consumed in the growth process that led to the sheet-like PbS crystal growth."
"Nanosheets can also be prepared at room temperature. For instance, hexagonal PbO (lead oxide)) nanosheets were synthesized using gold nanoparticles as seeds under room temperature. The size of the PbO nanosheet can be tuned by gold NPs and concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons for the formation of the PbO nanosheets. The same process was observed for iron sulfide nanoparticles."
Carbon nanosheets have been produced using industrial hemp bast fibres with a technique that involves heating the fibres at over 350F (180C) for 24 hours. The result is then subjected to intense heat causing the fibers to exfoliate into a carbon nanosheet. This has been used to create an electrode for a supercapacitor with electrochemical qualities ‘on a par with’ devices made using graphene.
"Metal nanosheets have also been synthesized from solution-based method by reducing metal precursors, including palladium, rhodium, and gold."

The FS E.424 is a class of Italian railways electric locomotives. They were built in 1943-1951 and have been decommissioned in 2008.
"A design for a small multi-service Bo-Bo locomotive, with speed up to , had been devised by Giuseppe Bianchi as early as in the 1930s, but the project had been halted by the introduction of the E.326 and E.428. After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (engines, bogies, suspension etc.)."
"Breda SpA workshop provided the three prototypes of E.424 in 1943-1944. Mass production, however, could begin only after the end of World War II, part of the funds provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration program."
The locomotives have been built in four series starting from year 1943:
"Class E.424, having DC type motors like all the Italian locomotives of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on start, a rheostat is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (""Maniglione""), but through an automatic system, called ""Avviatore Automatico"", derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs."
"The driver simply selects the combination (series or parallel), and the relative rheostat contactors are automatically and gradually closed by this system; in case of failure, the driver can manually rotate an apposite wheel (that also usually rotates automatically as the system advances) to proceed with the exclusion."
"When the rheostat is completely excluded for the series combination, field shunts can be inserted, or the driver can proceed to parallel combination, making a transition, which is handled by a device called ""CEM"" that automatically combines the motors (closing various contacts) accordingly."
"Originally more than one unit could be coupled and be controlled remotely by the first locomotive using a system called ""Comando Multiplo""; on the central part of the cab there also was a door that enabled the crew to pass from one locomotive to another in case of problems. However, because of safety issues and the imperfect reliability of this system (there were no instruments indicating the status of the slave locomotive, so it was not certain if it correctly made a transition or not, for example), it was abandoned and then disassembled."
"Eleven units received compound-type motors, enabling a very fine speed control, in a range included between in series combination, and in parallel."

"In geometry, the great dodecahemicosahedron (or small dodecahemiicosahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
It is a hemipolyhedron with ten hexagonal faces passing through the model center.
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the dodecadodecahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common), and with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common)."
